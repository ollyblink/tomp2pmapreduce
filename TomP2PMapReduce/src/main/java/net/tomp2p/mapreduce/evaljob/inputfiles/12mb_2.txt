These last three were brought alongside erenightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till morning; and theboat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and thelantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon theblack, glossy back, and far out upon the.. <p 492 >midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surfupon a beach.  Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; whocrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played roundthe whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.  A sound likethe moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah,ran shuddering through the air.  Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face toface, saw the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemedthe last men in a flooded world.  I have dreamed it again, said he.  Of thehearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can bethine?  And who are hearsed that die on the sea?  But I said, old man, thatere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must verily be seen by theeon the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of thelast one must be grown in America.  Aye, aye!  a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for thepall-bearers.  Ha!  Such a sight we shall not soon see.  Believe it or not,thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.  And what was that saying aboutthyself?  Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thypilot.  And when thou art so gone before --if that ever befall --then ere Ican follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still? --Was it not so?     Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have here two pledgesthat I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.  Take another pledge, oldman, said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom,-- Hemp only can kill thee.  The gallows, ye mean. --I am immortal then, onland and on sea, cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision; -- Immortal on landand on sea!  Both were silent again, as one man.

LONDON:    RICHARD BENTLEY AND SON    Publishers in Ordinary to Her Majesty the Queen.    1888.    (_All rights reserved._)THAT UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE.CHAPTER I.The following morning Mrs. Dormer-Smith was in a flutter of excitement.She left her bedroom fully an hour earlier than was her wont. But beforeshe did so she sent a message begging May not to absent herself from thehouse. For even in this wintry season May was in the habit of walkingout every morning with the children whenever there came a gleam of goodweather. Smithson, Mrs. Dormer-Smith's maid, who was charged with themessage, volunteered to add, with a glance at May's plain morningfrock--"Mr. Bragg is expected, I believe, Miss.""Very well, Smithson. Tell my aunt I will not go out without herpermission."Smithson still lingered. "Shall I--would you like me to lay out yourgrey merino, Miss?" she asked."Oh no, thank you!" answered May, opening her eyes in surprise. "If I dogo out, it will only be to take a turn in the square with the children.This frock will do quite well."Smithson retired. And then Harold, who was engaged in a somewhat languidstruggle with a French verb, looked up savagely, and said--"I hate Mr. Bragg."Wilfred, seated at the table with a big book before him, which wassupposed to convey useful knowledge by means of coloured illustrations,immediately echoed--"I hate Mr. Bragg.""Hush, hush! That will never do!" said May. "Little boys musn't hateanybody. Besides, Mr. Bragg is a very good, kind man. Why should youdislike him?""Because he's going to take you away," answered Harold slowly."Nonsense! I dare say Mr. Bragg will not ask to see me at all. And if hedoes, I shall not be away above a few minutes.""Shan't you?" asked Harold doubtfully."Of course not! What have you got into your head?""Yesterday, when they didn't think I was listening, I heard Smithson sayto Cecile----"May stopped the child decisively. "Hush, Harold! You know I never allowyou to repeat the tittle-tattle of the nursery. And I am shocked to hearthat you listened to what was not intended for your ears. That is notlike a gentleman. You know we agreed that you are to be a real gentlemanwhen you grow up--that is, a man of honour.""_I_ didn't listen!" cried Wilfred eagerly."I am glad you did not.""No, _I_ didn't listen, Cousin May. I was in Cyril's room. Cyril gave mea long, long piece of string;--ever so long!"May laughed. "Your virtue is not of a difficult kind, Master Willy! Younever do any mischief that is quite out of your reach." Then, seeingthat Harold looked still crest-fallen, she kissed his forehead, and saidkindly, "And Harold will not listen again. He did not remember that itis dishonourable."The child was silent, with his eyes cast down on his lesson-book, for awhile. Then he raised them, and looking searchingly at May, said, "Isay, Cousin May, I mean to marry you when I grow up.""And so do I!" said Wilfred, determined not to be outdone."Very well. But I couldn't think of marrying any one who did not knowhis French verbs. So you had better learn that one at once."Harold's naturally rather dull and heavy face grew suddenly bright; andhe settled himself to his lesson with a little shrug, and a shake like apuppy. "No; you wouldn't marry any one who didn't know French, wouldyou?" said he emphatically."And _I_ know F'ench!" pleaded Wilfred."There now, be quiet, both of you, and let me finish my letter," saidMay. And there was nearly unbroken silence among them.Meantime Mr. Bragg was having an interview with Mrs. Dormer-Smith. Hehad gradually made up his mind to put the same question to her that hehad put to Mrs. Dobbs: namely, whether May were free to receive hisproposals. He could not help being uneasy about young Bransby'srelations with May. Mrs. Dobbs, it was true, had denied that hergranddaughter thought of him at all; and Mr. Bragg did not doubt Mrs.Dobbs's veracity. But he underrated her sagacity; or, rather, heropportunities for knowing the truth. She lived very much outside ofMay's world. She might divine the state of May's feelings, and yet bemistaken as to their object. The story he had heard of young Bransby'shaving been rejected by Miss Cheffington could not be true; for was notyoung Bransby a constant visitor at her aunt's house--frequenting it ona footing of familiarity--talking to May herself with a certain air ofconfidential understanding? He had observed this particularly duringlast night's dinner.But if, on the other hand, the possibility of Mrs. Dobbs being mistakenon this question were once admitted, all sorts of other possibilitiespoured in after it as by a sluice-gate, and lifted Mr. Bragg's hopes toa higher level. At any rate, he resolved to take some decisive step.Time had been lost already. He had told Mrs. Dobbs that he was too oldto trust to the day after to-morrow; and that was now three months ago!Hence his visit to Mrs. Dormer-Smith by appointment--an appointment madeverbally the preceding evening, with the request that she would mentionit to no one; least of all to Miss Cheffington.Aunt Pauline was, of course, quite sure beforehand what was to be thesubject of their conversation; and was not in the least surprised(although inwardly much elated) when Mr. Bragg broached it."Understand me, ma'am," said Mr. Bragg. "I only wish you to tell metruly whether, according to the best of your belief, Miss C.'saffections are engaged. I ask no questions beyond that. I don't want topry.""Engaged! Oh dear, no; I assure you----""Excuse me, ma'am. But I mean a little more than that," said Mr. Bragg,slightly hastening the steady stride of his speech, lest she shouldinterrupt him again. "Of course, I don't expect you to be inside of yourniece's heart. A deal of uncertainty must prevail in what you may callassaying any human being's feelings. You may use the wrong test for onething. But ladies are keen observers; specially where they like--or, forthe matter of that, dislike--any one very much. And what I want to knowis this: Have you any reason to think Miss C. is in love with any one?"Mrs. Dormer-Smith, who was listening with a bland smile, almost startedat this crude inquiry. She felt the need of all her self-command topreserve that repose of manner which she considered essential togood-breeding. But she answered gently, though firmly--"My dear Mr. Bragg, that is out of the question. My niece is entirelydisengaged. A girl of her birth and breeding is not likely to entertainany vulgar kind of romance in secret!""Thank you, ma'am," said Mr. Bragg. Then he added ponderingly, "It mightnot be vulgar, though!"Mrs. Dormer-Smith privately thought Mr. Bragg no competent judge of whatmight, or might not, be vulgar in a Cheffington. She merely replied,with a certain suave dignity, referring to a former speech of his--"Do I understand rightly that you desire to speak with Miss Cheffingtonyourself?""If you please, ma'am. Yes; I think I should like to go through withit.""I will send for her to come here, Mr. Bragg."She rang the bell and gave her orders; and during the pause whichensued, neither she nor Mr. Bragg spoke a word. He was absorbed in hisown thoughts, and by no means as fully master of himself as usual. Shewas plaintively regretting that May had refused to change her morningfrock for something more becoming. "Not that it can be of vitalimportance _now_," thought Mrs. Dormer-Smith, faintly smiling toherself, with half-closed eyes.Presently the door opened, and May stood on the threshold."Come in, darling," said her aunt. "Mr. Bragg wishes to speak with you.And I will only assure you that he does so with my and your uncle's fullknowledge and approbation." With that, Aunt Pauline glided into the backdrawing-room, and withdrew by a door opening on to the staircase, whichshe shut behind her, immensely to May's surprise.All at once a nameless dread came over the girl, chilling her like acold wind. They had some bad news to give her of Owen! She turnedsuddenly so deadly pale as to startle Mr. Bragg; and looking up at himwith piteous, frightened eyes, stammered faintly, "What is the matter?""Nothing at all! Nothing is the matter that need frighten you, my dearyoung lady. Lord bless me, you look quite scared!"His genuine tone reassured her. And the colour began to return to lipsand cheeks. But the wilful blood now rushed too hotly into her face. Hersecond thought was, "They have found out my engagement to Owen!" Andalthough this contingency could be confronted with a very differentfeeling, and with sufficient courage, yet she could not control thetell-tale blush."Just you sit down there, and don't worrit yourself, Miss Cheffington,"said Mr. Bragg. In his earnestness he reverted to the phraseology of hisearly days. "There's no hurry in the world. If you was startled, justyou take your own time to come round.""Thank you," answered May, dropping into the armchair he pushed forward."I am very sorry to have alarmed you," she said. "I'm afraid I must begrowing nervous! I never thought I should be able to lay claim to thatinteresting malady."Although she smiled, and tried to speak playfully, she had really beenshaken, and she profited by the advice, which Mr. Bragg repeated, to"sit still, and take her own time about coming round."By-and-by she said, almost in her usual voice, "Will you not sit down,Mr. Bragg? I am quite ready to listen to you."Mr. Bragg hesitated a moment. He would have preferred to stand. He wouldhave felt more at his ease, so. But, looking down on the slight youngfigure before him, it occurred to him that it would be--in somevaguely-felt way--taking an unfair advantage of the girl to dominate herby his tall stature. So he brought himself nearer to her level bysitting down on an ottoman opposite, and not very near to her."I suppose," said he, after a little silence, during which he lookeddown with an intent and anxious frown at the floor, "I suppose you can'tgive a guess at what I'm going to say?"May believed she had guessed it already. But she answered, "I wouldrather not guess, please. I would rather that you told me.""Well, perhaps it may simplify matters if I mention that I have had someconversation on the subject with Mrs. Dobbs.""With Granny?" exclaimed May, looking full at him in profoundastonishment."Yes; it's some little while ago, now. Mrs. Dobbs spoke verystraightforward, and very kind, too; but I'm bound to say she did _not_give me any encouragement."May stared at him in a kind of fascination. She could not remove hereyes from his face. And she began to perceive a dreadfulclear-sightedness dawning above the confusion of her thoughts.Mr. Bragg was not looking at her. He was leaning a little forward, withhis arms resting on his knees, and his hands loosely clasped together.He went on speaking in a ruminating way; sometimes emphasizing hisphrase by a slight movement from the wrist of his clasped hands, and asif he were, with some difficulty, reading off the words he was utteringfrom the Oriental rug at his feet."You see, Miss Cheffington, of course I'm aware there's a greatdifference in years. But that's not the biggest difference in reality. Idon't believe myself that I'm so very much older in some ways than I wasat five-and-twenty. I was always a steady kind of a chap, and I neverhad much to say for myself--never was what you might call lively, youknow."May sat spell-bound; looking at him fixedly, and with that dawn ofclear-sightedness rapidly illumining many things, to her unspeakableconsternation."No; it isn't the years that make the biggest difference. I'm below youin education, of course, Miss Cheffington, and in a deal besides, nodoubt. But I can be trusted to mean all I say--though I'm not able tosay all I mean, by a long chalk."As he said this he raised his eyes for the first time, and looked ather. She was still regarding him with the same fascinated, almosthelpless, gaze. But when she met his clear, honest, grey eyes, with awistful expression in them which was pathetically contrasted with themassive strength of his head and face, she was suddenly inspired tosay--"Please, Mr. Bragg, will you hear me? I want to tell you somethingbefore you--before you say any more. I think you are my friend, and ifyou don't mind, I should like to tell you a secret. May I?"He nodded, keeping his eyes on her now steadily."Well, I--I hope you will forgive me for troubling you with myconfidence. I _know_ you will respect it. If I had not such a highesteem and regard for you I--I _could_ not say it." She stopped aninstant, there was a choking feeling in her throat. She paused, masteredit, and went on. "I have promised to marry some one whom I love verymuch, and no one knows about it but Granny."When she had spoken, she hid her hot face in her hands, and criedsilently.There was absolute stillness in the room for some minutes. At length shelooked up and saw Mr. Bragg still sitting as before, with looselyclasped hands and downcast eyes. May rose to her feet, and said timidly,"I hope you are not angry with me for--for telling you?"Mr. Bragg stood up also, and placing one broad, powerful hand on herhead, as a father might have done, looked down gravely at her upturnedface."Angry! Lord bless you, my child, what must I be made of to be angrywith _you_?""Oh, thank you, Mr. Bragg! And will you promise--but I know youwill--not to betray me?"He did not notice this question. His mind was working uneasily. Hethrust his hands into his pockets, and walked to the other side of theroom and back, before saying--"This person that you've promised to marry, is he one that your peoplehere"--he jerked his head over his shoulder in the direction in whichMrs. Dormer-Smith had disappeared--"would approve of?""Oh, yes!" answered May. Then she added, not quite so confidently, "Ithink so. At any rate, I am very proud to be loved by him.""And Mrs. Dobbs--""Oh, of course, dear Granny thinks no one could be too good for me,"said May apologetically. "But she knows his worth.""Will you please tell me how long Mrs. Dobbs has known of this?" askedMr. Bragg, with a touch of sternness."Known? She knew, of course, as soon as I knew myself--on thetwenty-seventh of last September," answered poor May, with damask-rosecheeks.Mr. Bragg made a mental calculation of dates. His face relaxed; and henow replied to May's previous question."Yes, of course, I'll promise not to say a word till you give me leave.Especially since Mrs. Dobbs knows all about it. Otherwise, you're youngto guide yourself entirely in a matter so serious as this is."She thanked him again, and dried some stray tear-drops that hung on herpretty eyelashes.He stood for a moment looking at her intently. But there was nothing inhis gaze to startle her maiden innocence, or make her shrink from him;it was an honest, earnest, kindly, though melancholy look."Well," said he at last, "you're not so curious as some young ladies.You haven't asked me what it was I was going to say to you.""I dare say it was nothing serious," she answered quickly. "In any caseI am quite sure you will say, and leave unsaid, all that is right.""That's a--what you might call a pretty large order, Miss Cheffington.I'm an awkward brute sometimes, I dare say, but I'll tell you this much:If I don't say what I was going to say, it isn't from pride. I _have_had that feeling, but I haven't it now, in talking to you. No, it isn'tfrom pride, but because I want you and me to be friends--downright goodfriends, you know. And, perhaps, it would be more agreeable for you notto have anything concerning me in your memory that you'd wish to be whatyou might call sponged out of the record. I appreciate your behaviour,Miss Cheffington. You acted generous, and like the noble-hearted younglady I've always thought you, when you told me that secret of yours. Whynow----Come, come, don't you fret yourself!" he exclaimed softly, forthe tears were again trickling down her cheeks."You are so--so very kind and good to me!" she said brokenly."Lord bless me, what else could I be? There, there, don't you vexyourself by fancying me cast down or disappointed about--anything inparticular. A man doesn't come to my age without getting used todisappointments, big and little."He took up his hat and stopped her by a gesture as she moved towards thebell."No; don't ring, please! I've got an appointment in the City, and notmuch time to spare if I walk it. So I'll just let myself out quietly,without disturbing anybody. You can mention to your aunt that I shallhave the honour of calling on her again very soon. Good-bye, MissCheffington."May held out her hand. He touched it very lightly with his fingers, andthen relinquished it silently."You are sure," she said pleadingly, "you are quite sure you are notangry with me?""There ain't a many things I'm so sure of as I am of that," answered Mr.Bragg, in his ordinary quiet tones. And then he opened the door and wasgone.He went down the stairs, and through the hall, and into the streetwithout being challenged. He shut the street door softly behind him,with a kind of instinct of escape; and marched away rather quickly, butsquare and steady as ever.After a while he looked at his watch, hesitated, and finally hailed ahansom cab."Poultry! You can take it easy. I'm not in a hurry," he said to thedriver, as he got into the vehicle.Then Mr. Bragg leaned back, and began to think. He had a habit offrequently closing his eyes when meditating, and this habit it was whichhad impelled him to get into a cab, since a pedestrian in the streets ofLondon could only indulge in it at the risk of his life; and Mr. Bragghad no--not even the most passing--temptation to suicide. He shut hiseyes tight now, tilted his hat backward from his forehead, and reviewedthe situation.He had behaved very well to May, and was conscious of having behavedwell to her; she deserved the best and most considerate treatment; butMr. Bragg was no angel, and he was extremely angry with Mrs.Dormer-Smith. He felt some irritation--very unreasonably, as he wouldby-and-by acknowledge--against Mrs. Dobbs--she had been ratherexasperatingly in the right. But Mrs. Dormer-Smith had been mostexasperatingly in the wrong, and he was very angry with her. Why had shenot confessed that she knew nothing at all about her niece's feelings?It was clear she was quite ignorant of them. She had only to say thatshe could not undertake to answer for May; that would at least have beenhonest!"I dare say I might have spoken, all the same," Mr. Bragg admitted tohimself. "I think p'r'aps I should. I'd got to that point where a man_must_ know for himself what the answer is to that question, and when'likely' or 'unlikely' won't serve his turn. But I could ha' manageddifferent. I needn't have looked like a Tomnoddy. Trotted outthere--making a reg'lar show of a man; not a doubt but what that flunkeyknew all about it. Woman's a fool!"Mr. Bragg's indignation rolled off like thunder in these brokengrowlings. And beneath it all--deeper than all--there lay an achingsorrow. It would not break his heart, as he knew; it might not evenspoil his dinner; but it was a real sorrow, nevertheless. In the momentof assuring him that he must not hope to win her, May had seemed to himbetter worth winning than ever; her soft touch had opened a longsealed-up spring of tenderness. There was some rough poetry within him,none the less pathetic because he knew thoroughly, sensitively, howunable he was to give it expression, and how ridiculous the meresuggestion of his trying to do so would seem to most people. Heresolutely refrained as much as possible from letting his mind busyitself with these hidden feelings; his very thoughts seemed to hurt themat that moment.He preferred to nurse his wrath against Mrs. Dormer-Smith, and to resenther having betrayed him into an undignified position. Mr. Bragg had beenprosperous and powerful for many years, and the sense of being balkedwas very irksome to him; more irksome than in the days of his poverty,when youth and hope were elastic, and battle seemed a not unwelcomecondition of existence.But before he reached the end of his eastward journey Mr. Bragg began tospeculate about the man whom May loved. In spite of Mrs. Dobbs'semphatic denial, he could not dismiss the idea that Theodore Bransby wasthe man. He had gathered the impression that Mrs. Dobbs did not likeTheodore, and he remembered May's deprecating words, "Granny would notthink any one too good for me!" which seemed to indicate that Mrs. Dobbshad not hailed the engagement with rapture. Thinking over the dates, heconcluded--quite correctly--that May's lover, whoever he might be, haddeclared himself not long after his (Bragg's) interview with Mrs. Dobbs.Now, Theodore Bransby had been in Oldchester at that time, as he wellremembered.Why Theodore, if it were he, should keep his engagement secret from theDormer-Smiths, was not easily explicable. But Mr. Bragg knew the youngman's political projects; and it might be that Theodore would wish toapproach May's family armed with all the importance which a successfulelectoral campaign would give him. One thing Mr. Bragg felt tolerablysure of--that Aunt Pauline would regret acutely the declension from anephew-in-law with fifty thousand a year, to one whose income did notcount as many hundreds! It was, perhaps, rather agreeable to Mr. Braggto think of this. It was certainly a comfort to him to be able todislike May's lover on independent grounds. He had always entertained anantipathy towards the young man; and, however sincere and tender hisinterest in May Cheffington might be, it did not modify, by a hair'sbreadth, his opinion of young Bransby."And, after all, it may not be him!" said Mr. Bragg, reflectively andungrammatically. "But if it isn't him, it can't be anybody I know."The person he had appointed to meet in the City was an Oldchester man;and when the business part of their interview was concluded, he said toMr. Bragg--"There's bad news from Combe Park. Haven't you heard? Oh! why they sayMr. Lucius Cheffington can't live many days. So that scamp,What's-his-name, the nephew, will come in for it all. The old lord'sawfully savage, I'm told. Shouldn't wonder if it balks young Bransby'shopes of getting his seat. Old Castlecombe won't like paying electionexpenses for him _now_. Great pity! He's a very rising young man, and acredit to Oldchester."CHAPTER II.When Mr. Bragg was gone, May felt a cowardly temptation to run away toher own room, and there recover her composure in solitude. But shereflected that that would be scarcely fair to her aunt, who, no doubt,was waiting with some impatience to hear the result of the interview. Soshe dried her eyes, and resolutely ascended the stairs to her aunt'sroom.The gentle, refined voice which had once so charmed her (but which, asshe had long since learned, could utter sentiments singularly atvariance with its own sweetness) answered her tap at the door by saying,"Is that dear May? Come in." May entered, and saw her aunt reclining ina lounging chair by the fireside. A book lay open beside her; but sheevidently had not been reading recently. She looked up at May's flushedface and tear-swollen eyes, and these traces of emotion seemed to hersatisfactory indications of what had passed. "He has spoken! It's allright!" she said to herself. Then aloud, with a tender smile, holdingout both her hands, "Well, darling?"The softness of her tone had a perversely hardening effect on May. Ifher aunt had expected her to accept Mr. Bragg--and May was not dullenough to doubt this, now that her eyes were illumined by that dawn ofclear-sightedness which had been so amazing to her--the least she coulddo was to be quiet and common-sensible about it. Any assumption ofsentiment seemed to May to be sickening under the circumstances. So sheanswered dryly--"Mr. Bragg desired me to tell you that he will have the honour ofcalling on you again before long.""Is he gone?" asked Mrs. Dormer-Smith, with a momentary twinge ofanxiety."Yes; he is gone. He had an appointment in the City, and was ratherpressed for time; so he could not stay to take leave of you.""Oh!" exclaimed her aunt, sinking back among her cushions with a smile,"I forgive him." Then seeing May turn away as if to leave the room, shesuddenly sat up again, and said with an air of gentle reproach, "Andhave you nothing to say to me, dear May?""Nothing particular, Aunt Pauline.""Nothing particular! I do not think that is very kindly said, May."May's conscience told her the same thing. She had yielded to a movementof temper. The most sensitive chords in her own nature had been jarred,and were still quivering. But that was no reason why she should beunkind or uncivil to her aunt; she repented, and, with her usualimpulsive candour, said--"I beg your pardon, Aunt Pauline. I ought not to have answered you so.""You have been agitated, dear child. Come here, and sit down by me. Nowtell me, May--you surely will tell _me_--Mr. Bragg has proposed to you,has he not?""No, Aunt Pauline.""_What?_"Mrs. Dormer-Smith would have been shocked if she could have seen her ownface in the glass at that moment. The vulgarest market-woman'scountenance could not have expressed surprise and consternation moreunrestrainedly."I think he, perhaps, would have asked me to marry him: but I stoppedhim.""You stopped him?" echoed her aunt, with clasped hands. But a littlegleam of hope revived her. The matter had been mismanaged in some way.May was so deplorably devoid of tact! All might yet be well. "And why,for pity's sake, May, did you stop him?""Because, as I could not accept him, Aunt Pauline, I wished to spare himas much as possible.""Could not accept him! Good heavens, May, this is frightful! Have youlost your senses? Do you know who and what Mr. Bragg is?""He is a good, honest man; and I esteem him and like him.""And is not that enough? Do you know that there are girls of--I won'tsay better family, but--higher rank than yours, who would give theirears to be----But it can't be! You are a foolish, inexperienced child,who don't understand your own good fortune. You cannot be allowed tothrow away this splendid opportunity. I will write to Mr. Bragg myself,and----""Stay, Aunt Pauline. Please to understand that I will never, under anycircumstances, dream of marrying Mr. Bragg. He is quite persuaded ofthis. He and I understand each other very well, and we mean to continuegood friends; but pray do not lower your own dignity by writing to himon this subject!"Mrs. Dormer-Smith burst into tears. "Go away, you ungrateful child," shesaid, from behind her pocket-handkerchief. "I could not have believedyou would have behaved in this manner after all I have done for you!"May would have been more distressed than she was had the spectacle ofher aunt's tears been rarer. But she had seen Mrs. Dormer-Smith weepfrom, what seemed to her, very inadequate motives:--even once at themisfit of a new gown. Nevertheless, she tried to soothe her aunt."Please don't cry, Aunt Pauline. I can't bear you to think meungrateful. But, after all, what have I done? I dare say--I am sure,indeed, that you are only anxious for my welfare. And what sort of alife could I expect if I married a man I could not love?""I beg you will not talk such nursery-maid's nonsense to me,May," returned her aunt, sprinkling some rose-water on herpocket-handkerchief, and dabbing her wet cheeks with it. "Could notlove, indeed! Why could you not love him? Do you expect to rant througha _grande passion_ like a heroine on the stage? I am shocked at you,May! Girls in your position owe a duty to society."May knew that her aunt was unanswerable when she broached thesemysterious dogmas about "society"--unanswerable, at all events, by her.She could as soon have attempted a theological argument with a devoteeof Mumbo Jumbo. So she held her peace, and stood still, anxious toescape, and yet fearful of seeming to be unfeeling by going away at thatmoment. One idea at length suggested itself to her as a possibleconsolation for her aunt, and she proceeded to offer it withunreflecting rashness."But, Aunt Pauline," she said, "after all, you know, Mr. Bragg is a verylow-born man. He was once a common artisan in Oldchester. And youremember you even thought Theodore Bransby presumptuous----"The immediate reply to this well-meant suggestion was a fresh burst oftears. "You are too insupportable, May. One might suppose you to be anidiot! What has been the use of all my care, and my endeavours to makeyou look at things as a girl of your condition ought to look at them?Mr. Bragg could have placed you in a brilliant position. Now, I daresay, he will marry Felicia Hautenville. I have no doubt he will, and itwill serve you right if he does. You think of no one but yourself. Whatdo you suppose that worthy woman, Mrs. Dobbs, will say when she hears ofyour behaviour? After all the money she has spent on sending you toLondon!"May turned round suddenly. "What do you say, Aunt Pauline?" she asked,almost breathlessly. "Granny has spent money to send me to London?"Mrs. Dormer-Smith caught at a forlorn hope. Might it not be possible,even now, to influence May through her affection for her grandmother?"Of course, May," she replied, with an injured air. "Where do yousuppose the money came from? Your uncle and I, as you must be wellaware, find it difficult enough to keep up our position in society, withCyril to place in the world, and those two little boys to provide for!""But papa!" gasped May. "I thought my father was paying----""You chose to assume it. I never told you so. Mrs. Dobbs particularlywished us to keep the arrangement secret, and we did so. I appreciateher wisdom _now_ in keeping it secret from you, May; for your conductto-day shows you to be destitute of the most ordinary tact andprudence.""And Granny--dear old Granny--has been depriving herself of money tokeep me in town!" exclaimed the girl, still entirely possessed with thisnew revelation.Mrs. Dormer-Smith gallantly tried to improve her opportunity. She raisedherself into an upright posture in her chair, and said solemnly, "Yes,May; and a nice return you make for it! The good old creature, no doubt,has been pinching herself for years on your account. She has paid foryour schooling, your dress, and everything; she even contrives, I daresay, by enduring some privations" (Mrs. Dormer-Smith did not in theleast suppose this to be the case, but she felt it was a rhetorical"point," and likely to affect her niece), "she even contrives to giveyou a season in town, with charming toilettes from Amelie, and apresentation dress that a duke's daughter might have worn, andeverything which a right-minded girl ought to appreciate--and this isher reward! You refuse one of the finest matches in England! I cannotbelieve you will persist in such _wicked_ perversity, May," continuedPauline, rising to new heights of moral elevation. "No, I cannot believeyou will be so ungrateful to that good old soul, and, indeed, I may say,to Providence! Really, there is something almost impious in it. Mrs.Dobbs does all she can to counteract the results of your father'sunfortunate marriage--we _all_ do all we can; circumstances are soordered by a Superior Power as to give you the chance of catching--ofattracting the regard of a man of princely fortune--_you_, rather than adozen other girls whose people have been looking after him for the lastthree seasons, and all this you reject! Toss it away, like a baby with atoy! No, May; you _are_ a Cheffington--you _are_ my poor unfortunatebrother's own flesh and blood, and I will not believe it of you." Then,sinking back in her chair, she added in a faint voice, "Go away now, ifyou please, and send Smithson to me. I shall have to speak to your unclewhen he comes in, and I really dread it. He will be so shocked--soastonished! As for me, I am utterly _hors de combat_ for the day, ofcourse."May willingly escaped to her own room, and locked herself in. Herthoughts were in a strange tumult, busied chiefly with this news aboutMrs. Dobbs. Why had she not guessed it before? Was there any one in theworld like that staunch, generous, unselfish woman? This explained hergiving up her old, comfortable home in Friar's Row. This explained ahundred other circumstances. May thought, between laughing and crying,of Jo Weatherhead's eccentric eulogy on her grandmother as compared withclassical heroines, and she longed to tell him that he was right. Thefull tide of love and sympathy and gratitude towards "Granny" rose inher breast above all other emotions, and, for the moment, even Mr.Bragg's wonderful proposals, and her aunt's still more wonderfulreception of them, were forgotten. It even overflowed and temporarilyobliterated impressions and feelings far keener than any which poor Mr.Bragg had power to awake in her heart.What a fool's paradise had she been living in! And what a mistaken imageof her father she had been cherishing all this time! He had contributednothing to her support; he had coolly left the whole care of her toothers; he had been thoroughly selfish and indifferent. Every one seemedselfish but Granny! One thing she hastily resolved on: not to remainanother week in London at her grandmother's expense.When Mr. Dormer-Smith came home, and was duly informed by his wife ofMay's incredible conduct, his dismay was nearly as great as Pauline's.Perhaps his surprise was even greater; for he had accepted his wife'sassurances that May was quite prepared to give Mr. Bragg a favourableanswer. He could not bring himself to regard May's behaviour with suchlofty moral reprobation as his wife did, but he certainly thought thegirl had acted foolishly, and even blameably.Mr. Dormer-Smith was extremely anxious not to offend or disgust Mr.Bragg. To have a man of that wealth in the family might be the making ofall their fortunes. Already Mr. Bragg's advice and assistance hadprofited him. He and his wife had even privately reckoned on Mr. Bragg'sdoing something handsome (in a testamentary way) for their youngerchildren. May was very fond of her cousins, and what would a fewthousands be to Mr. Bragg? Now the unexpected news which met him brokeup all these glittering hopes, as a thaw melts the frost-diamonds."You must speak with her, Frederick. I have said all I can, and I reallyam not equal to another scene," said Pauline.She had subsided into an attitude of calm despondency, and seemed to besupported chiefly by the sense of her own unappreciated merits. She didnot mention that she had already written a private and confidentialletter to Mr. Bragg, and despatched it by special messenger to the hotelwhere he usually stayed when in London.Mr. Bragg had no town house, and the choosing and furnishing of asuitable mansion for him and his bride had been one of the rewards ofvirtue which Mrs. Dormer-Smith had, for some time past, beenanticipating for herself. May was so young and inexperienced, and Mr.Bragg--dear, good, rich man!--had so little knowledge of the fashionableworld, that Pauline confidently expected to be for some years to comethe presiding genius of the elegant entertainments to which they wouldinvite only the very best society. For--giving the rein to herfancy--Pauline had resolved that Mr. and Mrs. Bragg were to be extremelyexclusive. A well-born girl who, without fortune or title, had succeededin marrying a millionnaire, might surely--if there were any poeticaljustice at all in the world--indulge herself in the refined pleasure ofsocial selection, and quietly decline to receive those doubtful"Borderers" who made society, as Mrs. Griffin often complained, so sadlymixed!All this was not to be relinquished without a struggle. Mrs.Dormer-Smith would do her duty to the last. Duty had commanded her tomake an immediate appeal to Mr. Bragg not to take May's answer as final;but duty did not, she considered, require her to tell her husbandanything about it until she saw how it turned out."You _must_ see her, Frederick," repeated Mrs. Dormer-Smith. AndFrederick accordingly sent for May to come and speak with him.He awaited her in the drawing-room; and when May entered the room hereye fell on the easy-chair which Mr. Bragg had placed for her, standingout just where she had left it. The whole scene came back to her mind asvividly as if she saw it in a picture before her bodily eyes; and thecolour rose to her forehead.Her uncle went to her, and took her hand kindly. "Well, May," said he,"what is all this I hear?" He was leading her towards the armchair; butMay avoided it, and took another seat, and Mr. Dormer-Smith dropped intothe armchair opposite to her, himself.In considering what could have been the motives which had induced her toreject Mr. Bragg, he had prepared himself to listen to some--perhapsfoolishly--romantic talk on May's part. Mr. Bragg certainly could not,by any stretch of friendship, be considered romantic. But UncleFrederick would try to show his niece how much sounder and solider afoundation for domestic happiness Mr. Bragg was able to offer her thanany amount of the qualities which go to make up a young lady's hero ofromance.What he was not at all prepared for was May's saying earnestly, as sheleant forward with clasped hands, "Oh, Uncle Frederick what is all this_I_ hear? My dear, good grandmother has been impoverishing herself topay for keeping me in London! Why did you not tell me the truth? Nothingshould have induced me to accept such a sacrifice!"Mr. Dormer-Smith was not a ready or flexible man by nature; and it tookhim a minute or so to alter the sight, so to speak, of the big gun hehad been getting into position to mow down May's resistance againstmaking a splendid marriage."Why--eh? Oh, Mrs. Dobbs's allowance! Oh yes. Well, my dear, you havepretty well answered your own question. If you had known, you would nothave consented to come to town, and take your proper place in society.Your aunt considered it most important that you should do so. And I'msure, May, you must allow that she has done her very best for you inevery way.""_Her_ very best!" thought May; "yes, perhaps!" Then she said aloud,"Aunt Pauline has been very kind to me. But how could there be any'proper place' for me in society, unless I could honestly afford to takeit? To get it by imposing privations on my grandmother, who is notbound, except by her own abundant goodness, to do anything for me atall--this surely could not be right or just, could it?"Mr. Dormer-Smith was not prepared with a cogent answer on the spur ofthe moment. So he fell back on murmuring some faint echoes of his wife'smaxims about "duty to society." But he had not Pauline's sincereconvictions on the subject, and did it but feebly."And, oh, Uncle Frederick," proceeded May; "what a mean impostor I havebeen all this time!""Impostor, my dear? No, no; that's nonsense, you know."He was rather relieved to find May talking nonsense. That seemed muchmore normal and natural in a girl of her age than being so deucedlogical and high-strung, and that sort of thing."That," he repeated firmly, "is really nonsense.""But, Uncle Frederick, I was appearing before everybody under falsepretences. People thought--I thought myself--that my father supplied allmy expenses."Mr. Dormer-Smith pursed up his mouth and puffed out his breath with alittle contemptuous sound. Then he answered--"Your father! My dear May, your father hasn't paid a penny piece for yousince you were seven years old."May was silent for a minute or so. She could not help some bitterthoughts of her father, but it was not for her to utter them. At lengthshe said--"I cannot go on accepting my grandmother's sacrifice, Uncle Frederick. Iwill not."It occurred to Mr. Dormer-Smith, as it had occurred to his wife, thatMay's affection for Mrs. Dobbs might supply the fulcrum they wanted fortheir lever. He answered--"Well, my dear, I don't blame your feeling, though it is a littleoverstrained, perhaps. But you have it in your own power to more thanpay back all Mrs. Dobbs has done for you.""How?" asked May innocently."Why, I am sure Mr. Bragg would be only too delighted----""Oh, Mr. Bragg! I was not thinking of Mr. Bragg, and I would rather nottalk of him just now."This was a little too much. Mr. Dormer-Smith's face assumed a veryserious, not to say severe, expression as he looked at his niece andsaid--"Excuse me, May, but you must think of him, and talk of him also. Thatwas the subject I sent for you to speak about. I don't know how we havedrifted away from it. Your aunt tells me that you have not actuallyrefused Mr. Bragg, but merely stopped him from proposing to you. Now, ifthat is the case, the matter is not past mending. No doubt Mr. Bragg mayfeel a little offended.""He is not in the least offended," interposed May."Ah! Well, so much the better. But you can hardly expect me to believethat he particularly enjoyed the interview! Mr. Bragg is a person of agreat deal of importance in the world, and not accustomed to be treatedas if he were of no consequence. However," proceeded Mr. Dormer-Smith,relaxing into a milder tone, "I dare say he can make allowances for ayoung lady taken by surprise--it seems you did not expect his proposal?""Expect it! How on earth could I have expected it?""Some girls would. However, let us stick to the point. I don't think itis too late for you to make everything well again.""Uncle Frederick, I am bound to assure you most positively that I cannever marry Mr. Bragg.""Now, don't be obstinate, May. What is your objection to him?"The girl hesitated. Then she replied, looking up with pleading eyes,"How can I say, Uncle Frederick? One does not marry a man simply becauseone has no particular objection to him. Mr. Bragg is old enough to be mygrandfather!""No; scarcely that. Look here, May, I have a great affection for you.You have been very good and kind to my little boys, and they doat onyou. I am not ungrateful for all you have done for the children,although I may not have said much about it."May was melted in an instant by these words of kindness, and saidwarmly, "And _I_ am not ungrateful, Uncle Frederick. I know you meanwell by me, and Aunt Pauline, too.""Certainly we do. Naturally so! Well now, just listen to me, my dear. Ifyou were my own daughter I should give you just the same advice. Ishould be very glad and thankful for a daughter of mine to marry Mr.Bragg. I know a great deal more of the world than you do--or ever will,please God!--for it isn't a very pleasant kind of knowledge--and I tellyou honestly, there are very few men, young or old, in the society wefrequent, whom I'd choose for your husband rather than Mr. Bragg. He isa little uneducated, and unpolished, of course. We needn't pretend notto know that. But he is a man of sound heart and sound principles--a manwhose private life will bear looking into. I'm talking to you as if Ireally were your father, May; and I do assure you that I would not urgeyou to marry a man twice as rich as he is, if I knew him to be--to bewhat some men are, and what you in your innocence have no idea of. Iwant you to believe that, May.""I do believe it, Uncle Frederick," sobbed May, taking his hand, andkissing it."There, there, my dear, don't cry! I couldn't talk in this way to manygirls of your age; but you have so much sense and right feeling! Iwanted you to understand that I'm not an altogether hard, worldly kindof man, ready to offer you up to Mammon--eh? Look here, May; I wouldstand by you against--against every one, if I thought you were going tobe sacrificed. But you must trust a little to the experience of thoseolder than yourself, my dear. Come, come, there now, don't distressyourself! You are not to be pressed and hurried, you know. You willthink it all over quietly. Go to your own room and lie down a while. Iwill take care that you are not disturbed or worried in any way."He led her gently to the door. She was now sobbing uncontrollably. Shelonged to tell her uncle the truth about her engagement, but she thoughtthat loyalty to Owen and to her grandmother forbade her to speak outfully without their leave. As she was quitting the room, she turnedround, and, making a strong effort to speak firmly, said--"Uncle Frederick, I shall never, as long as I live, forget the kindwords you have said to me. And, whatever happens, don't believe I amungrateful.""Well, Frederick?" said Mrs. Dormer-Smith, when her husband re-appearedin her room.Frederick walked to the window, took out his pocket-handkerchief, andanswered from behind it, rather huskily--"Well, I don't know. I almost hope it may come right.""Do you? Do you really? Well, that is a feeble ray of comfort. But it israther too bad to have to undergo all this wear and tear of feeling, inorder to secure that perverse child's fortune in spite of herself!"There was a long pause, during which Mr. Dormer-Smith continued to lookout of the window, and to blow his nose in a furtive kind of way. "Iwonder----" he began slowly, and then stopped himself."You wonder--Frederick? Pray speak out! I assure you I am not able tostand much more suspense and anxiety.""I was merely going to say, I wonder if there can be any one else.""Any one else?""Any man she cares for.""Good Heavens, Frederick, who should there be? Really, you are not veryconsiderate to startle me with such extraordinary suppositions withoutthe least preparation. There is no one, of course.""You are sure?""I am sure there is no one _possible_. I know, of course, every man shehas danced with, or who has paid her the smallest attention, and thereis not one who could be thought of for a moment, even if Mr. Bragg didnot exist. I should not hesitate to speak very strongly if I suspectedher of any culpable folly of that kind. A girl without a farthing in theworld! And her father, my poor unfortunate brother Augustus, in Heavenknows what dreadful position! That May, under all the circumstances, canbehave in this way, is too intolerable. The more one thinks of it themore flagrant it seems. No sense of duty! No consideration for herfamily! I shall be compelled to say to her----"Suddenly, in the midst of these fluent, softly uttered sentences, Mr.Dormer-Smith turned round, wiped his eyes, blew his nose defiantly, andsaid, with an explosion of feeling--"The girl's a fine creature, and, by God, I won't have her baited!"CHAPTER III.Each mortal's private feelings are the measure of the importance ofevents to him. And it often happens that while our neighbours arepitying or envying us, on account of some circumstance which, all theworld agrees, must have a weighty bearing on our fate, we are mainlyindifferent to it, and are occupied with some inner grief or joy, whichwould seem to them very trivial.To have received and rejected an offer of marriage from a man worthfifty thousand a year would have been deemed by most of MayCheffington's acquaintance about as important an event as could havehappened to her--short of death! But to her it was absolutely asnothing, compared with the facts that Owen was on the point of returningto England, and that he was to live in Mrs. Bransby's house.Why did this second fact seem to embitter the sweetness of the first?No, it was not the fact, she told herself, that was bitter; thebitterness lay in the manner of its coming to her knowledge. Why had notOwen written to her? There could be no reason to conceal it! Of course,none! Owen was doing all that was right, no doubt. But to allow her tohear of this step for the first time from Theodore Bransby at adinner-table conversation--this it was which irked her. So, at least,she had declared to herself last night. Then the tone in which her uncleand all of them had spoken of Mrs. Bransby and Owen had jarred upon herpainfully. Theodore had not joined in the tasteless banter; but thenTheodore's way of receiving it--with a partly stiff, partly deprecatoryair, as though there could possibly be anything serious in it--wasalmost worse!The pathway of life which had stretched so clear and fair before her buta short while ago, seemed now to have contracted into a tangled maze, inwhich she lost herself. The events of the morning had made May resolvethat all secrecy as to her engagement must come to an end. She must seeOwen immediately on his arrival in London. But how to do so? She did notknow whether he was or was not in England at that very moment! Well, atall events she knew Mrs. Bransby's address, and could write to himthere.This thought gave her a pang. And the pang was intensified by the suddenand vivid perception--as one sees a whole landscape by a lightning-flashout of a black sky--that it was caused by jealousy!Jealousy! She, May Cheffington, jealous--and of Owen? Yes; it might bepainful, humiliating, incredible, but it was true. The flash had beeninexorably sharp and clear.To young creatures, every revelation that they--even _they_--are subjectto the common woes, pains, and passions of humanity about which they mayhave talked glibly enough, is an amazement and a shock. Still earlier inour earthly course we doubt that Death himself can touch us. What childever realizes that it must die? It is only after many lessons that webegin to accept our share of mortal frailties and afflictions as amatter of course.Poor May felt sick at heart. Oh, if she could but see Granny! She longedfor the motherly affection which had never failed her since the day herfather left her--a rather forlorn little waif, whom no one seemed readyto love or welcome--in the old house in Friar's Row. She thought that tosit quite still and silent by Granny's knee, while Granny's kind oldhand softly stroked her hair, would charm away all her troubles, or atleast lull them to sleep.But for the present she could not rest. When she left her uncle, andfelt secure from interruption in her own room, she sat down and wrotetwo letters. The first was to Owen, begging him to come and see herwithout delay, and at the same time telling him that circumstances hadarisen which made it desirable to declare their engagement. The secondletter was to Granny.To Granny she poured out her gratitude. She thanked her and scolded herin a breath. Who had ever been so generous, and so careful to concealtheir generosity? And yet Granny had done very wrong to make such asacrifice as was involved in giving up the old home in Friar's Row."Had I known this a week ago," wrote May, "I do believe I should havetried to coax Mr. Bragg into breaking the lease, and _making_ you goback to the old house which you loved. But I cannot ask any favour ofMr. Bragg now!" Then she told her grandmother all about her interviewwith Mr. Bragg, and her aunt's bitter disappointment, and her uncle'skind behaviour, although she could see that he was disappointed too. "Iwonder," she added, "if you will be as astonished as I was? Perhaps not.I remember some things you said when I told you my grand scheme formarrying Miss Patty! Oh, dear me, I feel like some one who has beenwalking in his sleep--calmly and unconsciously tripping over the mostinsecure places. But now I have been suddenly awakened, and I feelchilly, and frightened, and all astray."When she had written them, she resolved to post the letters herself.Since she had volunteered to take her little cousins out for a walkoccasionally, the stringent rule which forbade her to leave the houseunattended by a servant had been relaxed--it was so very convenient toget rid of the little boys for an hour or two at a time! It left Cecilefree to do a great deal of needlework, a large proportion of it expendedon the alteration and re-trimming, and so forth, of May's own toilettes.Mrs. Dormer-Smith was strictly conscientious as to that; and since Maynever went beyond the limits of the neighbouring square, there could beno objection to the arrangement. One point, however, Aunt Pauline hadinsisted on--that these walks should always take place in the morning,or, at all events, during that portion of the day which did duty for themorning in her vocabulary. The proprieties greatly depend, as we know,on chronology; and many things which are permissible before luncheonbecome _taboo_ immediately after it.By the time May had finished her letters, however, it was well on in theafternoon. Carriages were rolling through the fashionable quarters ofthe town, and the footman's rat-tat-tat sounded monotonously like agigantic _tam-tam_, sacred to the worship of society.May went downstairs, and, opening the hall-door, found herself in thestreet alone, for the first time since she had lived under her aunt'sroof. There was a pillar letter-box, she knew, not far distant. To thisshe proceeded, and dropped her letters into it. It had been a fine dayfor a London winter; but the last faint glimmer of daylight had almostdisappeared as she turned to go back home.There was an assemblage of vehicles waiting before a house which she hadpassed on her way to the post-box. Now, as she returned, there was astir among them. Servants were calling up the coachmen, and opening andshutting carriage doors. A number of fashionably dressed persons, mostlywomen, came down the steps of the house and drove away. May paused amoment to let a couple of ladies sweep past her on their way to theircarriage. As she did so, she heard her name called; and, looking round,she saw Clara Bertram's face at the window of a cab drawn up near thekerbstone."Is it really you?" exclaimed Clara, as they shook hands. "I couldscarcely believe my eyes! What are you doing here alone?""I have been posting some letters." Then, reading an expression ofsurprise in the other girl's eyes, she added quickly, "You wonder why Ishould have done so myself. For a simple reason: I did not wish theaddress of one of them to be seen. But Granny knows all about it.""I am quite sure, dear, you have some good reason for what you havedone," answered Clara, in her quiet, sincere tones."And you?" asked May. "What are _you_ doing here?""I have been singing at a _matinee_ in that house. I was just about todrive off, when I caught a glimpse of you. I was not sure that it wasnot your ghost in the dusk!""I suppose you are constantly engaged now?""Yes; I have a great deal to do.""Oh, I hear of you. Your praises are in every one's mouth. Lady Moppettdeclares you are rapidly becoming the first concert singer of the day.She is as proud of you as if she had invented you! Indeed, she does sayyou are her 'discovery': as if you were a Polynesian island! I couldfind it in my heart to envy you, Clara. It must be so glorious to beindependent, and earn one's own living!"Clara smiled a faint little smile. "I am thankful to be able to earnsomething," she said. "But I don't think I should care so much about itif it were only for myself.""No, of course, dear! I know," rejoined May quickly. She had been toldthat the young singer entirely supported an invalid father and sister.Then she added, "Your voice is a great gift. There are so few things awoman can do to earn money.""Why, one would suppose that _you_ wanted to earn money!" said Clara,smiling."Perhaps."Clara looked more closely at her friend. The street lamps were nowlighted, and she could see May's face distinctly. "You are not lookingwell, dear," she exclaimed. "You seem fagged.""I am sick of London. I want to go home to Granny and be at peace,"answered May wearily. Then she went on quickly, to stave off anypossible questionings as to her state of mind. "But I must return forthe present to my aunt's house. Good-bye.""Stay!" cried Clara. "Will you not get into the cab, and let me driveyou home?""Drive! It is an affair of some two or three minutes at most.""Well, then, if you have half an hour to spare, let me drive you roundthe square, and then drop you at home. I have been wanting for three orfour days past to speak to you quietly. I can't bear to lose this rareopportunity. We do not meet very often." Then seeing that her friendhesitated, she asked, "Are you thinking about the cost of the cab forme?""Yes," answered May frankly."I thought so! That is just like you. But, indeed, you need have noscruples. The cab is engaged for the afternoon. When I sing at people'shouses, unless they send a carriage for me, the cab-fare is 'consideredin my wages.' Do come in!"May complied, and the cab moved away slowly.When they had proceeded a few yards, Clara said, "I wanted to tellyou--I think it right to tell you--something I have learned on goodauthority. Your father--I hope it won't distress you--is reallymarried."May's first thought was that here again her Aunt Pauline had deceivedher!"Are you sure?" she asked."Yes, I think I may say so.""And how did you learn it?""From Valli.""Oh, from Signor Valli! But you told me he was not to be trusted.""In some ways not. But I do not doubt what he says on this subject. Hehas no motive to invent the information. He cares nothing about thematter--except that I think he rather likes La--Mrs. Cheffington thannot.""Is she a foreigner?" asked May, with a little more interest than shehad hitherto shown. Her listless way of receiving the news had surprisedher friend."Yes, an Italian. At least, she is Italian by language, if not by law;for she comes from Trieste. But she is almost Cosmopolitan; for she hastravelled about the world a great deal. She is--or was--an opera-singer.Her name in the theatre is Bianca Moretti. She was rather celebrated atone time." Clara paused a moment, and then added, "I hope this news doesnot grieve you, dear?""No," answered May dreamily, "it does not grieve me. If my father iscontent, why should I grieve? He and I have been parted--in spirit aswell as body--for so many years, that his marriage can make but littledifference to me.""I was afraid you might feel----Of course, Captain Cheffington's familywill look on it as a dreadful _mesalliance_."May was silent for a few minutes. Then she said a very unexpectedthing--"Poor woman! I hope he is good to her!""I suppose," said Clara, rather hesitatingly, "that the reason whyCaptain Cheffington has not announced his marriage to his relations isthat he thinks they would object to receive an opera-singer.""Possibly," answered May. (In her heart she thought, "The reason is thathe cares nothing for any of us.")"It must be that," proceeded Clara. "For as far as I can make out thereseems to be no concealment about it in Brussels."Then they arrived at Mrs. Dormer-Smith's house, and May alighted andbade her friend farewell."Thank you, Clara," she said, "for telling me the truth. I loathemysteries and concealments. When one thinks of it, they are despicable.""Unless when one conceals something to shield others," suggested Claragently.She had told her friend what she believed to be the truth so far as thefact of her father's marriage was concerned. But she had not given herall the details and comments which Signor Valli had imparted to her onthe subject. His view of the matter was not flattering to CaptainCheffington. Valli declared, with cynical plainness of speech, thatCaptain Cheffington had married La Bianca merely to have the right toconfiscate her professional earnings. Latterly these had become veryscanty. La Bianca did not grow younger, and her voice was rapidlyfailing her. A good deal of gambling had gone on in her house at onetime. But it had been put a stop to--or, at least, shorn of its formerproportions by the ugly incident of which Miss Polly Piper had broughtback a version to Oldchester. Since that, things had not gone well withthe Cheffington _menage_. Captain Cheffington had become insupportable,irritable, impossible! He was, moreover, a _malade imaginaire_; aquerulous, selfish, tyrannous fellow; always bewailing his hard fate,and the sacrifice he had made in so far derogating from his rank as tomarry an opera-singer. La Bianca was a slave to his caprices. To be sureshe was not precisely a lamb. There were occasions when she flamed up,and made quarrels and scenes."But," said Signor Valli, "he is an enormous egoist, and, with a woman,the bigger egoist you are, the surer to subjugate her. La Bianca wouldhave stabbed a man who loved her devotedly, for half the ill-treatmentshe endures from that cold, stiff ramrod of an Englishman."Such was Vincenzo Valli's version of the case; and Clara Bertram, inlistening to him, believed that, in the main, it was a true one. Vallihad recently been in Brussels, where he had seen the Cheffingtons; andone or two other foreign musicians whom she knew had come upon them fromtime to time, and had given substantially the same account of them. Asto persons in the rank of life to which Captain Cheffington stillclaimed to belong, they were no more likely to come across him now thanif he were living on the top of the Andes.May went into the house wearily. In the hall she met her uncleFrederick, who had just come in, and had seen the cab drive away."Who was that with you, May?" he asked, in some surprise."It was Miss Bertram," she answered. Then she asked her uncle to stepfor a moment into the dining-room. When he had done so, and closed thedoor, she said quietly, "My father is married to a foreign opera-singer;they are living in Brussels. Did you and Aunt Pauline know this?""Know it? Certainly not!"May was relieved to hear this, and drew a long breath. The sensation ofliving in an atmosphere of deception had oppressed her almost with afeeling of physical suffocation. She then told her uncle all that ClaraBertram had said.Mr. Dormer-Smith puckered his brows, and looked more disturbed than shehad expected. "This will be another blow for your aunt," he saidgloomily."I don't see why Aunt Pauline should distress herself," she answeredcoldly; "my father is not likely to trouble her. Married or unmarried,my father seems determined to keep aloof from us all." Then she went toher own room.Mr. Dormer-Smith shrank from communicating this news to his wife, and ashe went upstairs he anticipated a disagreeable scene. He did not verygreatly care about the matter himself, for he agreed with May that itwas unlikely Augustus would trouble any of the family with his presence;and to keep away was all that he required of his brother-in-law. Onentering his wife's room, he found her still in a morning wrapper,reclining on her long chair; but her hair had been dressed, and sheannounced her intention of coming down to dinner. Her countenance, too,wore an unexpected expression of placidity, almost cheerfulness. Thecountry post had arrived, and there were several letters scattered on alittle table by Mrs. Dormer-Smith's elbow.Her husband went and placed himself with his back to the fire, which wasburning with a pleasant glow in the grate. "Well," he said, in asympathizing tone, to his wife, "how are you feeling now, Pauline?"They had not met since his outburst about May, and he had been rathernervously uncertain of his reception. Pauline never sulked, neverstormed, and rarely scolded. But when she felt herself to be injured,she would be overpoweringly plaintive. Her plaintiveness seemed to wrapyou round, and damp you, and chill you to the bone, like a Scotch mist,and when used retributively was felt--by her husband, at all events--tobe very terrible. But on this occasion, as has been said, there was acertain mild serenity in her face which was reassuring."Thanks, Frederick," she answered. "There seems to be a _little_ lesspressure on the brain. Smithson bathed my forehead for three-quarters ofan hour after you were gone."Mr. Dormer-Smith hastened to change the subject. "Post in, I see," hesaid. "Any news?""I have a very nice letter from Constance Hadlow," answered Pauline,with her eyes absently fixed on the fire. "How thoughtful that girl is!What tact! What proper feeling! Ah! the contrast between her and May ispainful at times."Mr. Dormer-Smith made a little inarticulate sound, which might meananything. Despite her beauty, which he admired, Miss Hadlow was no greatfavourite of his. But he would not imperil the present calm in hisdomestic atmosphere by saying so."Misfortunes," pursued Pauline, still gazing at the fire, "never comesingly, they say; and really I believe it.""Does Miss Hadlow announce any misfortune?""Oh no!--at least, we are bound not to look on it as a misfortune. Whocould wish him to linger, poor fellow? She is staying near Combe Park,and she says Lucius has been quite given up by the doctors. It is aquestion of days--perhaps of hours.""No? By George! Poor old Lucius!" returned Mr. Dormer-Smith, with atouch of real feeling in his tone."Of course, this will make an immense difference in May's prospects. Idon't mean to say that she will easily find another millionnaire, withsuch extraordinarily liberal ideas about settlements as Mr. Bragg hintedto me this morning; _that_ is, humanly speaking, not possible," saidMrs. Dormer-Smith solemnly. "Still, the affair may not be such anirretrievable disaster as we feared.""How do you mean?" asked Frederick, whose mind, as we know, moved ratherslowly."It _must_ make a difference to her," repeated his wife in a musingtone. "The only child and heiress of the future Viscount Castlecombe, ofcourse----""By George! I didn't think of that at the moment. Yes, Gus is the next.I suppose that's quite certain?"Mrs. Dormer-Smith did not even condescend to answer this query, butmerely raised her eyebrows with a superior and melancholy smile.Frederick pondered a minute or so; then he said, "You say 'heiress,' butI don't think your uncle would leave Gus a pound more than he couldn'thelp leaving him.""I fear that is likely. Still, there is much of the land that must cometo Augustus, and Uncle George has enormously improved the estate. Do youknow I begin to hope that I may see my poor unfortunate brother comeback and take his proper place in the world? When I remember what he wasfive-and-twenty years ago, it does seem cruel that he should have beenabsolutely eclipsed during all this time. I recollect so well the day hefirst appeared in his uniform. He was brilliant. Poor Augustus!"Mr. Dormer-Smith felt that the difficulty of telling his wife what hehad just heard assumed a new shape. He had feared to add to the load ofwhat Pauline considered family misfortunes; now it seemed as if his newswould dash her rising spirits, and darken roseate hopes. He passed hislarge hand over his mouth and chin, and said, with his eyes fixeduneasily on his wife, who was still contemplating the fire with an airof abstraction--"Ah! Yes. But--there may be a Lady Castlecombe to find a place in theworld for.""Not improbable. I hope there may be. Augustus is little past the primeof life. It would compensate for much if----""I'm sorry to say, Pauline, that there's no chance of that--I mean ofsuch a marriage as you are thinking of. I came upstairs on purpose totell you. In one way it won't make any difference to _us_. And I'm sureyour brother has never deserved much affection or consideration fromyou. But still, I know it will worry you."Mrs. Dormer-Smith sat upright, with her hands grasping the two arms ofher chair, and said, with a sort of despairing calm, "Be good enough togo on, Frederick. I entreat you to be explicit. I dare say you meanwell, but I do not think I _can_ endure much more suspense.""Well, you know the rumours we've heard from time to time about thatdisreputable Italian woman in Brussels--opera-singer, or something ofthe kind? Well--I'm afraid there's no use deluding ourselves; I think itcomes on good authority--your brother has married her."CHAPTER IV.Although the little house in Collingwood Terrace had not, perhaps, fullyjustified Martin's cheery prophecy that it would turn out an "awfullyjolly little place when once they got used to it," yet there, aselsewhere, peace, goodwill, order, and cleanliness mitigated what wasmean and unpleasant. Mrs. Bransby's love of personal adornment rested ona better basis than vanity, although she was, doubtless, no more freefrom vanity than many a plainer woman. She had an artistic pleasure inbeauty and elegance, and an objection to sluttishness in all its Proteanforms, which might almost be described as the moral sense applied tomaterial things. Her delicate taste suffered, of course, from much thatsurrounded her in the squeezed little suburban house. But, far fromsinking into a helpless slattern, according to the picture of herpainted by Mrs. Dormer-Smith's commonplace fancy, she exerted herself tothe utmost to make a pleasant and cheerful home for her children. Herlife was one of real toil, although many well-meaning ladies of theDormer-Smith type would have looked with suspicion on the care Mrs.Bransby took of her hands, and would have been able to sympathize morethoroughly with her troubles if her collars and cuffs had occasionallyshown a crease or a stain.Mr. Rivers's room had been prepared with the most solicitous care. Itwas a labour of love with all the family. Martin and his sister Etheldid good work, and even the younger children insisted on "helping," tothe irreparable damage of their pinafores, and temporary eclipse oftheir rosy faces by dust and blacklead. The young ones were elated bythe prospect of seeing their playfellow Owen once again; Martin reliedon his assistance to persuade Mrs. Bransby that he (Martin) should andcould earn something; and even Mrs. Bransby could not help building onOwen's arrival to bring some amelioration into her life beyond thesubstantial assistance of his weekly payments.He arrived in the evening, and was received by the children withenthusiasm, and by Mrs. Bransby with an effort to be calm and cheerful,and to suppress her tears, which touched him greatly, seeing her, as hedid for the first time, in her widow's garb. He was touched, too, by heralmost humble anxiety that he should be content with the accommodationprovided for him, and earnestly assured her that he considered himselfluxuriously lodged.And, indeed, for himself he was more than satisfied; but he could nothelp contrasting this mean little house with Mrs. Bransby's beautifulhome in Oldchester, and he found it singularly painful to see her inthese altered circumstances. In this respect, as in so many others, hisfeeling differed as widely as possible from Theodore's. For Theodore,although fastidious and exacting as to all that regarded his owncomfort, sincerely considered his step-mother's home to be in allrespects quite good enough for her, and had privately taxed her withinsensibility and ingratitude for showing so little satisfaction in it.All the family, including Phoebe, who grinned a recognition from thetop of the kitchen stairs, agreed in declaring Owen to be lookingremarkably well. He was somewhat browned by the Spanish sunshine, and hehad an indefinable air of bright hopefulness. In Oldchester he used tolook more dreamy."It is business which is grinding my faculties to a fine edge," heanswered laughingly, when Mrs. Bransby made some remark to the aboveeffect. "I shall become quite dangerously sharp if I go on at thisrate.""I don't think you look at all sharp," replied Mrs. Bransby gently.Whereupon Martin told his mother that she was not polite; and Bobby andBilly giggled; and they all sat down to their evening meal verycheerfully.When the table was cleared, and the younger children had gone away tobed under Ethel's superintendence, Mrs. Bransby said, "You smoke, do younot, Mr. Rivers?""Not here, in your sitting-room.""Oh, pray do! It does not annoy me in the least."Owen hesitated, and Martin thereupon put in his word. "Mother does notmind it, really. Not decent, human kind of tobacco such as gentlemenuse. That beast, old Bucher, used to smoke a great pipe that smelt likedouble-distilled essence of public-house tap-rooms.""Well, a cigarette, if I may," said Owen, pulling out his case. Then,drawing the only comfortable easy-chair in the room towards thefireside, he asked, "Is that where you like to have it?""That is your chair," said Mrs. Bransby timidly."Good Heavens!" exclaimed Owen, genuinely shocked, "what have I done tomake you suppose I could possibly be capable of taking your seat?"He gently took her hand and led her to the chair. Then, looking roundthe little parlour, he spied a footstool, which he placed beneath herfeet. As he looked up from doing so, he saw her sweet pale face, withthe delicate curves of the mouth twitching nervously in an endeavour tosmile, and the soft dark eyes full of tears. "You must not spoil me inthis fashion," she began. But the attempt to speak was too much for her.She broke down, and covered her face with her trembling hands.Martin instantly crossed the room, and stood close beside her, placingone arm round her shoulders, and turning away from Owen, so as to fencehis mother in. The boy's protecting attitude was pathetically eloquent.And so was the way in which his mother presently laid her head down uponhis shoulder. They remained thus for a little while. Owen stood by thefire with his elbow on the mantelpiece, and his forehead resting on hishand. And all three were silent.At length, when Martin felt that his mother was no longer trembling, andthat her sobs were subsiding, he looked round and said, "Mother's upsetby being treated properly. No wonder! It's like meeting with a white manafter living among cannibals. If you had ever seen that beast Bucher,you'd understand it.""Shall I go away?" asked Owen.Mrs. Bransby quickly held out one hand entreatingly, while she dried hereyes with the other. "Please stay!" she said. "And please light yourcigarette! And please draw your chair near the fire, and make yourselfas comfortable--or as little uncomfortable--as you can! Forgive me. I donot often break down in this way; do I, Martin?""No," answered Martin, moving the lamp so as to throw his mother'stear-stained face into shadow, and then squeezing his own chair into thecorner beside hers, "no; you were cheerful enough with Bucher. Well, ofcourse one _had_ either to take Bucher from the ludicrous side, or elseshoot him through the head, and have done with him!""I see," said Owen, nodding, and not sorry to hide his own emotion undercover of a joke. "And Mrs. Bransby was unable to make up her mind tojustifiably homicide him?""Yes. He _was_ a beast, though, and no mistake! Phoebe was in such arage with him once, that she threatened to throw a hot batter-pudding athis head. I'm sorry now she didn't," added Martin, with pensive regret.Then they talked quietly. Mrs. Bransby, with womanly tact, led Owen tospeak about himself and his prospects. There was little to tell in theway of incident. He had been working steadily, and did not dislike hiswork. And he had been well contented with his treatment by Mr. Bragg.Mr. Bragg had made him an offer to send him, in the spring, to BuenosAyres. It might be an opening to fortune."I suppose you will go? Of course, you will go!" said Mrs. Bransby.She could not help her voice and her face betraying some disappointment.They did not, however, betray all she felt; for the prospect of Owen'sgoing away again so soon sent a desolate chill to her heart. Owen lookedat her quickly, and then as quickly looked away and tossed the end ofhis cigarette into the fire, before lighting another."I don't know," he answered, bending down over the flame; "it willrequire some consideration. I believe the alternative is open to me ofremaining in Mr. Bragg's employment in England. Anyway, there is timeenough before I need decide--several months, I hope."Mrs. Bransby breathed a low sigh of relief; then she said, in aperceptibly more cheerful tone, "It seems so odd to think of you writingbusiness letters, and making up accounts, and being altogether turnedinto a--a----""A clerk.""No; not precisely that. You are Mr. Bragg's secretary, are you not?""What I am aiming at--what I hope to be--_is_ a clerk, you know. If Icalled myself a field marshal or an archbishop it would not alter thefact; but it does seem odd to me, too, when I think of it. Better luckthan I deserve, as my shrewd old friend Mrs. Dobbs said to me.""Talking of Mrs. Dobbs, May Cheffington came to see me here."Owen had heard regularly from May every week; he carried her last letterin his breast-pocket at that moment (not the note which she had postedherself--that had not yet reached Collingwood Terrace), so that he wasnot starving for news of her. Nevertheless, he felt a wild temptation tocry out, "Tell me about her! Talk of nothing else!" But he answeredcomposedly, "That was quite right; she ought, of course, to have come tosee you.""She only came once," observed Martin."That was not her fault," said his mother. "She could not, as I told youall, make frequent journeys here--she could not command her time or heraunt's servants; she goes out a great deal.""Her aunt lives for the world, you see," said Owen apologetically."Oh, there is no reason why May should not enjoy her youth and all heradvantages," answered Mrs. Bransby softly; "she is a very sweet, lovablecreature--much too good for----" Mrs. Bransby here checked herself, andstopped abruptly."Oh, mother! that's all bosh!" cried Martin, flushing hotly. "I meanthat notion of yours. Now, I ask you, Mr. Rivers, is it likely that MayCheffington would _think_ of marrying Theodore? Ah! you may well lookflabbergasted! Anybody would who knew them both. You see, mother, Mr.Rivers takes it just as I did. You don't think it likely, do you, Mr.Rivers?"Owen had recovered from the first startling effect of hearing those twonames coupled together; but he was inwardly raging and lavishing avariety of the most unparliamentary epithets on Theodore."If you ask my candid opinion, I _don't_ think it likely," he answeredcurtly."Of course not!" exclaimed the boy. "It's only Theodore's bounce; I toldmother so.""Why, you don't mean that Bransby has the confounded impudence tosay----""No, no," interposed Mrs. Bransby. "Don't let us exaggerate. Theodorehas never made any explicit statement on the subject. But he meets Mayvery frequently in society. He is constantly invited by Mrs.Dormer-Smith. They are thrown a great deal together. May has evidentlybecome much more kind and gracious to him of late--for I remember whenshe used positively to run away from him!--and as for him, he is as muchattached to her as he can be to any human being. I do believe that.""Attached your granny!" cried Martin, apparently unable to find a politephrase strong enough to convey his deep disdain. "Theodore is muchattached to number one, and that's about the beginning and the end of_his_ attachments!""Hush, Martin," said his mother severely. "You are talking of what youdon't understand. And you know how much I dislike to hear you use thattone about--your brother."She brought out the word "brother" with an obvious effort. In truth, shehad a repugnance to speaking, or even thinking, of Theodore as herchildren's brother. But it was a repugnance for which she blamedherself."I think," she added, "that you had better go to bed, Martin."The boy rose with an instant obedience, which had not alwayscharacterized him in the happy Oldchester days, and bent over his motherto kiss her."I'm very sorry. I did not mean to vex you, mother," he whispered."You're not angry with me, are you?""I _can't_ be angry with you, my darling boy. But I must do my duty. Youknow _he_ would say, I was right to correct you."Martin lifted up his face cheerfully, with the happy elasticity ofboyish spirits. "All right, mother. Good night. Good night, Mr. Rivers.""Good night, old fellow," responded Owen, grasping the boy's handheartily. He felt very strongly in sympathy with Martin, just then.Martin lingered. "May I ask just one thing, mother?" he said wistfully."You know we agreed not to tease Mr. Rivers with our affairs immediatelyon his arrival, Martin," replied his mother. Then, unable to resist hispleading face, she said, "If it really is only one question, perhaps Mr.Rivers would not mind----?""What is it you want to know, Martin? Speak out," said Owen."It's about the question I asked in my letter," replied Martin, blushingand eager. "Don't you think I ought to try and help mother? And don'tyou think I might have a chance of earning something?""That's two questions," said Owen, with a smile. "But I'll answer themboth. To number one, yes, undoubtedly. To number two, perhaps; but wemust have patience.""There, mother!" cried Martin, triumphantly turning his glowing face andsparkling eyes towards her. Then he shut the door, and rushed upstairs:his round young cheeks dimpled with smiles, and his heart so full ofjoyous hopes, that he was impelled to find some vent for his overflowingspirits by hurling his bolster at Bobby and Billy, who were sitting upin bed, broad awake. Thereupon there ensued smothered sounds ofscuffling and laughter, mingled with the occasional thud of a bolsteragainst the wall; until Phoebe, sharply rapping at the door, announcedthat unless Mr. Martin was in bed in two minutes, she would take awaythe light, and leave him to undress in the dark.When the widow was alone with Owen she began to pour forth the praisesof her eldest boy. She hoped Mr. Rivers did not think her selfish inletting the boy share so much of her cares and anxieties. But althoughonly a child in years he was so helpful, so loving, so sensible--hadsuch a manly desire to shield her and spare her! And then, after askingOwen's advice about the boy, she added, naively--"Only, please, don't advise me to make a drudge of him. He is so clever,he ought to be educated. His dear father looked forward to his doing sowell at school and college.""If I am to advise, really," said Owen, "I ought first to understand thestate of the case with as much accuracy as possible."Mrs. Bransby at once told him the details of her circumstances assuccinctly as she could. There was a small sum secured to her, but sosmall as barely to suffice for finding them all in food. Theodore hadmade himself responsible for the rent during one twelvemonth. He hadalso (or so she had understood him) promised to send Martin to his oldschool for a couple of years. But it now appeared that his offer waslimited to paying for Martin's being taught at a neighbouring day schoolof a very inferior kind. And even this seemed precarious."I thought at one time," said Mrs. Bransby, "that I might, perhaps,earn, a little money by teaching. But I must do what I can to educateEthel and Enid and the younger boys until they get beyond me. I fear Icould not find time to go out and give lessons, even if I succeeded ingetting an engagement. So I am trying to get some sewing to do. I canuse my needle, you know, while I hear Ethel say her French lesson, andmake Bobby and Billy spell words of two syllables."Poor Mrs. Bransby spoke with much diffidence of her plans and projects.She had a very humble opinion of her own powers, and was touchinglywilling to be ruled and directed. Owen suggested that it might have beenbetter for her to have remained in Oldchester, where she was amongfriends. But she answered that she had had scarcely any choice in thematter. It was Theodore who had decided that she was to remove toLondon. It was Theodore who had chosen that house for her. In the firstdays of her loss she had blindly accepted all Theodore's directions."Perhaps I was to blame," she said. "But I was so overwhelmed, and Ifelt so helpless; and it seemed right to listen to Theodore.But--although I never say a harsh word about him to strangers, nor tothe children if I can help it--I cannot pretend to you, who know us allso well, that he is kind to us. Martin resents his behaviour very much.I do my best, but it is impossible to make my boy feel cordially towardshis half-brother.""Of course it is!" said Owen. Then he closed his lips. He would nottrust himself to talk of Theodore at that moment.It was a comfort to Mrs. Bransby to speak openly to a sympathizinglistener, and one whom she could thoroughly trust. She talked on for along time; and at length, looking at her watch, accused herself ofselfishness in keeping Owen so long from the rest which he must needafter his journey. As she returned the watch to her pocket, she saiddeprecatingly--"Perhaps you think I ought not to possess so handsome a watch under thepresent circumstances? Theodore was quite displeased when he saw it, andsaid it ought to be sold. But, you see, I need some kind of watch; andthis is an excellent time-keeper; and--and my dear husband gave it to meon the last birthday we spent together."She turned away to hide the tears that brimmed up into her eyes; and,going to a little side table, lit her chamber candle.Owen rose from his chair. "Look here, Mrs. Bransby," he said. "Of coursewe must have more talk together, and more time to consider matters; butit seems to me that Martin is right in wishing to earn something. Youngas he is, it might be possible to find some employment for him whichshould bring in a weekly sum worth having. And as to his education--ithas occurred to me that I could, at least, keep him from forgetting whathe has learnt already; and, perhaps, coach him on a little further. Anhour or two every evening, steadily occupied, would do a good deal. Itwould be a great pleasure to me to be able to do this small service foryou. That is to say," he went on quickly, in order to check the outburstof thanks which trembled on her lips, "if you are good enough to allowme the advantage of continuing to occupy a room here. I hope you will beable to put up with me. I don't _think_ that Phoebe will want to throwa hot batter-pudding at my head. But that may be my vanity! Good night.Don't say any more now, please. We will think it over on both sides. Iwill smoke one more cigarette, if I may, before I turn in."He opened the door, and held it open for her. As she passed him, shepaused an instant, and said in a low, trembling voice, "God bless you!"CHAPTER V.The next morning's post brought Owen May's note. She had written ithurriedly--not so much from stress of time as under the influence ofthat kind of hurry which comes from thronging thoughts and eageremotions. The sight of her handwriting was a joyful surprise to Owen;and he wondered, as he tore open the cover, how she could have learnedhis arrival so quickly. But he found that she had written simply in thehope that he might get her letter as soon as possible, and without anyknowledge of the fact that he was already in London.The contents of it did not much disquiet him. She had something to sayto him: he must come and speak with her as soon as possible after hisarrival. She was safe and well, he knew; and, with that knowledge, hethought that he could defy fortune. As to urging him to go to herquickly--that was, he told himself with a smile, a superfluousinjunction. What need of persuasion to do that which he ardently longedto do?He rapidly planned out the hours of his day. At ten o'clock he must bewith Mr. Bragg in the City. He had received a telegram in Paris makingthat appointment. He would probably find duties to detain him thereuntil the afternoon. Between two and three o'clock, however, he thoughthe could reach Mrs. Dormer-Smith's house at Kensington. From what heknew of the habits of the household, he judged that May would be at homeat that hour.He had much to think of regarding the future. A momentous decision laywith him. Had Mr. Bragg's offer of sending him to Buenos Ayres come acouple of months earlier, he might have accepted it. It was not, ofcourse, a certain road to success; and it had many draw-backs--chiefamong them being banishment from England. But, as he had told Mrs.Dobbs, he was ready to face that if it were required of him,understanding that he who starts late in a race must needs run hard. Butlatterly he had come to think that it might not be best for May that heshould go; and to do what was best for her was the supreme aim of hislife. He discovered from her letters that she was not happy andcontented in her aunt's house. The necessity of concealing herengagement was already painful and oppressive. How could she endure itfor two years? Truly, she might announce it, and go back to Oldchesterto her grandmother's house (for Owen had more than a suspicion that theDormer-Smiths would be very unwilling to keep her with them as thebetrothed bride of Mr. Bragg's clerk!)But there were other objections. Theodore Bransby, Owen was inwardlyconvinced, was his rival. He might try to injure him in his absence. Theabsent are always in the wrong. Or Theodore might annoy May withpersecutions. If he and May were to wait for each other, had they notbetter wait, at all events, in the same hemisphere? Owen knew very wellthat _some_ money--a decent competency--was indispensable to hismarriage. But that he might now reasonably hope to obtain in England.The balance of his judgment, the more he reflected on the situation,inclined the more decisively towards remaining.Other considerations than what was due to May could not have inclinedthe scale one hair's breadth in these deliberations. But when he thoughtover his last evening's interview with Mrs. Bransby, it pleased him tobelieve that his stay, if he stayed, would be very welcome to her andhers.He felt a profound and tender compassion for the widow. He admired herpatience, and the simple way in which she tried to do hard duties;accepting them as matters of course. And he was filled with indignationagainst Theodore Bransby. To these sentiments may be added the sensethat Mrs. Bransby relied on him; and the recollection of that day in theOldchester garden, when he had solemnly promised to be a friend to herand her children at their need. All these were powerful incentives tohelp her and stand by her.There was in Owen a somewhat unusual combination of heat andsteadfastness. He seldom belied his first impulse--the mark of a rarelysincere character, swayed only by honest motives. The offer he had madelast night to teach Martin he was not inclined to repent of in the "drylight" of next morning. It was plain, too, that his contribution to theweekly income was a matter of serious importance to the family;--farmore so than he had any idea of when he first proposed to board withthem, although the offer had been made in the hope of assisting them. Heturned over in his mind various projects on their behalf as he walkeddown to the City. It occurred to him that he might do well to speak toMr. Bragg on the subject. It was even possible that Mr. Bragg might findsome place for young Martin. Owen had a high opinion of his employer'srectitude and good sense; and he thought him, moreover, a kindlydisposed man. But he had no glimpse of the tenderness which was hiddenunder Mr. Bragg's plain, unattractive exterior, nor of the yearning forsome affection in his daily life, which sometimes made the millionnairelook back regretfully on the days when he and his comely young wifetoiled together; and when he, Joshua Bragg, in his fustian working suit,had been the dearest being on earth to a loving woman.Mr. Bragg appeared that day at his place of business looking as usual.He was clean shaven, and soberly and appropriately attired. He wasattentive to the matter in hand, mindful of details, accurate,deliberate--all as usual. And yet, so subtle is the quality of thespiritual atmosphere which we all carry about with us, there was not ajunior clerk in the place who did not feel that there was a cloud on Mr.Bragg's mind, and did not wonder "what was up with the governor."One wag opined that "Old Grimalkin had caught him at last." By whichirreverent phrase the profane fellow meant that the Most Noble theDowager Marchioness of Hautenville had succeeded in arranging analliance between Mr. Bragg and her daughter, the Lady Felicia. For itwas an open secret in the office, and the theme of infinite jest there,that Lady Hautenville pursued this aim with an indomitable, and evenferocious, perseverance worthy of the Berseker race from which sheprofessed to trace her descent. Her ladyship's hired barouche mightoften be seen during the season, floating like a high-beaked ship of theVikings on the busy tide of commercial life, and coasting down towardsthat plebeian shore of Tom Tiddler, where Mr. Joshua Bragg picked up somuch gold and silver. She would willingly have made as clean a sweep ofall his treasure as any piratical Scandinavian who ever carried off thepeaceful wealth of Kentish villages. Neither craft nor valour werewanting to her. She made ingenious excuses to see him:--sometimes shewanted to consult him as to the investment of non-existent sums ofmoney; sometimes to engage his presence at some fashionable gathering,where he was, of course, peculiarly fitted to shine. She sent in to hisoffice little perfumed notes, directed by the fair hand of Felicia inBrobdingnagian characters. Felicia herself, bright-eyed and crowned withgorgeous bonnets--spoil gallantly wrested from some lily-livered WestEnd milliner, who had not the courage to refuse her credit,--sat by hermother's side, and smiled with haughty fascination on Mr. Bragg,whenever he could be coaxed forth to speak with their ladyships at thecarriage door. And every creature in Mr. Bragg's wholesale office, downto the sharp Cockney urchin who sprinkled and swept the floors,perfectly understood why Lady Hautenville did all these things, andwatched her proceedings as a spectacle of very high sporting interest.Thus it was that when the wag before-mentioned opined that "Grimalkinhad caught the governor," by way of accounting for Mr. Bragg's lowspirits, it was received with the benevolence due to a deserving oldjest which has seen service. But when a younger man ventured tosuggest--more than half seriously--that, "perhaps the governor was inlove," the suggestion was received with genuine hilarity, and theoriginator of it immediately took credit for having fully intended acapital joke.Owen Rivers, arriving punctually, was shown into Mr. Bragg's privateroom. There he was greeted with the invariable grave, "How do you do,Mr. Rivers?" And then, after a moment, Mr. Bragg added, "So you've gotover punctual. I thought you _might_ manage without an extra day inParis. But you must have put your shoulder to the wheel to do it." Aspeech expressive, in Mr. Bragg's mouth, of very marked approbation.Then Owen proceeded to report what he had done in Paris, and to layletters and papers before Mr. Bragg; and for some time they attended tovarious matters of business. When these were over, Owen said--"When could I speak to you about some affairs of my own?""Well, now, p'raps; if you don't want to be long.""Half an hour?"Mr. Bragg looked at his watch, nodded, and, leaning his head on hishand, prepared to listen with quiet attention.Owen began by saying that he was inclined towards remaining in Englandrather than accepting the opportunity of going abroad; whereat Mr. Bragglooked thoughtful, but waited to hear him out without interruption. ThenOwen went on to speak of Mrs. Bransby and her altered circumstances, andof his wish and intention to assist and stand by her.When he ceased Mr. Bragg, having heard him with careful attention,said--"The first point to be considered is your own position. Concerning thesituation we spoke of, I think I can promise to keep you on as my--whatyou might call _business_ secretary. As to a private secretary, I don'thave much private correspondence, and what I have, I can pretty wellmanage myself. I should expect you to take a journey now and then intoforeign parts if necessary. Terms as before. But I tell you frankly, Isee no immediate prospect of a rise for you. If you went to Buenos Ayresyou might have a chance--only a chance, of course--of getting intosomething on your own account. One 'ud be steady as far as it went; theother 'ud be like what you might call a throw of the dice atbackgammon--chance _and_ play. It's for you to choose. With regard toMrs. Bransby, I--of course----Look here, Mr. Rivers, I'm a deal olderthan you--old enough to be your father--and I should like to give you alittle word of advice, if I could do it without offence.""I shall take it gratefully, Mr. Bragg, whether I act upon it or not.""Oh! as to acting upon it," said Mr. Bragg slowly; "it's a great thingto be sure that your advice won't be picked up and pitched back at yourhead like a stone. Well, you must understand that I don't mean anydisrespect to Mrs. Bransby, who is an excellent lady, I've no doubt. Ihaven't much acquaintance with her, though I have dined at her table.Her husband, Martin Bransby, I knew for years. I was his client, and hadreason to be well satisfied with him in all respects. So, youunderstand, my feeling is quite friendly. But I would just drop a wordof warning. You're a young man, and Mrs. Bransby, though she's olderthan you are, is still a young woman. And what's more, she's a veryhandsome woman. And----Ah, I see you're making ready to shy back thatstone, by-and-by. But just listen one moment. For you, at your age, toget entangled in that sort of engagement, and to undertake the charge ofa ready-made family of hungry boys and girls, would be simply ruin.You'd repent it; and then she'd repent it because you did, and you'd allbe miserable together; that's all."Owen's mouth was set, and his eyes sparkling with a rather dangerouslook. But he answered quietly, "Thank you, Mr. Bragg. I am sure you meanwell, or why should you trouble yourself to speak at all on the matter?""Just so; I'm glad you see that.""But may I ask what put the idea of any--any 'entanglement,' as you callit, between me and Mrs. Bransby into your head?""Understand me, Mr. Rivers; I meant all in honour, you know."Owen winced. The very assurance was almost offensive, but he returned,"I spoke very stupidly and awkwardly; I'll amend my phrase. I shouldhave said, what put it into your head that I was likely to marry Mrs.Bransby?""Put it into my head? Well, when a young man feels a soft sort ofcompassion for a beautiful woman who--who throws herself a good deal onhis sympathy, and looks to him for help and advice and all the rest ofit, and when the young man and the beautiful woman have opportunities ofseeing each other pretty constantly, why then I believe such a thing hasbeen heard of in history as their falling in love with each other. Itdon't need much 'putting into your head' to see that when you've come tomy years.""Are you quite sure," persisted Owen, "that no suggestion of this kindwas made to you by any third person? I have a particular reason forwishing to know."Mr. Bragg pondered. He had, in fact, heard Theodore's hints andinnuendos at the Dormer-Smiths, and although he was not consciouslymoved by them in what he had now said, there could be no doubt that theidea had been originally suggested to him by young Bransby and Pauline;Owen's words to-day had merely revived those impressions. After a longpause, he answered--"Well, I think I _have_ heard it spoken of; but, if so, all the morereason for you to be cautious.""I thought so!" said Owen. "Spoken of by----""Why, by Mrs. B.'s step-son for one; so you may suppose there wasnothing said against the lady. _He_'d think it an uncommon good thing, Idare say; it would relieve him of a burthen. He might wash his hands ofthe family if she was to marry again.""Relieve him of a burthen!" cried Owen, starting up from his chair."Have you any idea what he does for his father's widow and children, Mr.Bragg? Theodore Bransby is a liar. I know him. There's nothing too basefor him to insinuate against his stepmother, who is, I declare to God,one of the best and most innocent women breathing! Theodore has a grudgeagainst her and her children--a jealous, petty, despicable kind ofgrudge; and he's a mean-minded scoundrel!" He checked himself in walkingfuriously about the room, and turned to Mr. Bragg with an apology. "Ibeg your pardon, but I _cannot_ talk coolly of that fellow.""I'm inclined to agree with you, and yet I wish I could think better ofhim; or rather, I wish he was somebody else altogether," said Mr. Braggenigmatically, thinking of May."Mr. Bragg," said Owen, with a sudden inspiration, "will you come toCollingwood Terrace and see Mrs. Bransby? You will learn more about themall with your own eyes and ears in ten minutes than I could convey toyou in an hour. You shall take them unprepared. If you would look inthis evening about their tea-time you would find them all at home; itwould be a kind and natural act on your part, and would need noexplanation. Do come.""Well, yes; I will," answered Mr. Bragg. "Perhaps I ought to have doneso before. Any way, I'll come; just put down the address.""Thank you. Shall I write those Spanish letters now?""Ah! you'd better. Mr. Barker, there, will give you a seat for thepresent in his room."And so they parted.Mr. Bragg was by no means reassured as to his secretary being inconsiderable danger from the widow's fascinations. He remarked tohimself that Rivers had not said one word explicitly denying anyattachment between them, but he felt a new bond of sympathy with Rivers.It was agreeable to meet with such thorough fellow-feeling aboutTheodore Bransby. Perhaps a mutual dislike is a stronger tie than amutual friendship, because our hatreds need more justifying than ouraffections.By the time Owen's business was transacted, and he had eaten some foodat a neighbouring chop-house, it was past two o'clock, and then he setout for Mrs. Dormer-Smith's house on foot. It was a long way off, but itseemed to him more tolerable to walk than to jog along on the top of anomnibus, or to burrow underground in the crowded railway. In hisimpatient and excited frame of mind the rapid exercise was a relief.It was barely three o'clock when he reached the house in Kensington. Theservant who opened the door murmured something in a low voice, about theladies not receiving visitors in consequence of a family affliction.Being further interrogated, he believed that Mrs. Dormer-Smith's cousin,Lord Castlecombe's son, was dead."Tell Miss Cheffington that I am here," said Owen. "Give her this card,and say I am waiting to see her."His manner was so peremptory that, after a brief hesitation, the mantook the card, and ushered Owen into the dining-room to wait. The roomwas dimmer than the dim wintry day without need have made it, by reasonof the red blinds being partly drawn down, and filling it with a luridgloom.The servant had not been gone many seconds before the door opened, and arather pale face, not raised very high above the level of the floor,peeped into the room. The eyes belonging to the face soon made outOwen's figure in the dimness, and a childish voice said, in a subduedand stealthy tone, "Hulloa!""Hulloa!" returned Owen, in a tone not quite so subdued, but still low;for there was a general hush in the house which would have made ordinaryspeech seem startling."Do you want May?" asked the child."Yes; I do.""I heard you tell James to give her your card. Who are you?""I'm Owen. Who are you?" replied Owen, listening all the while for theexpected footfall."I'm Harold."Upon this, a second rather pale face, still nearer to the ground, peepedin at the door; and a second childish voice piped out faintly, "And I'mWilfred." Then the two children marched solemnly into the room, shuttingthe door behind them, and stared at Owen with judicial gravity."May's my cousin," said Harold, after contemplating the stranger for awhile in silence."And May's my cousin, too," observed Wilfred."I'm fond of her," pursued Harold."So am I," exclaimed Owen, walking across the room impatiently. "But whydoesn't she come? Where is she? Do you know?""Yes," replied Harold, with deliberation; "I know.""What can that man be about? He can't have given her the message!" saidOwen, speaking half to himself, his nervous impatience rising with everyminute of delay.Harold looked profoundly astute, as he answered, with a series ofemphatic nods, "No; he didn't. He took the card to Smithson; and I knowwhat Smithson will do; she'll read it first herself, and then she'lltake it to mamma, and then perhaps mamma will tell May--if you'rea--what is it?--a proper person. _Are_ you a proper person?""I say," said Owen suddenly, "will you go and fetch May? Tell her Owenis here waiting. Do go, there's a good boy!""Is May fond of you?" inquired Harold hesitating."May will be pleased with you if you go and fetch her. Run! Be off atonce now--quick!"After one searching look at Owen's face, the child disappeared swiftlyand silently. In less than two minutes a light footstep was hearddescending the stairs at headlong speed. The door opened, and May,almost breathless with haste and surprise, half stumbled into the darkroom, and he caught her in his arms."Is it really you?" she exclaimed, looking up at him with one hand onhis shoulder, and the other pushing back the hair from her forehead.Owen took the hand which rested on his shoulder, and pressed it to hislips. "It is very really I," he said, with his eyes fixed on her face ina tender rapture."It seems like a dream! So unexpected!""Unexpected! Why, you summoned me, and of course I am here!""Yes, it really does seem as if my note had been a spell to bring youacross the seas."    "'Over seas, over mountains,    Love will find out the way!'It doesn't alter that truth, that I happened to arrive in England onlylast night.""Only last night! How strange it seems! And you never let me know----""Darling, by the time it was quite certain what day I should be inEngland, a letter would not have outstripped me. I got my orders bytelegram. Oh, my love, what a long, long time it seems since I looked onyour dear face!""Tell me all about yourself, Owen. I want to hear everything.""So you shall. But you must explain first the meaning of your note. Tellme now--sit down here--what has happened?""I have so many things to say, I scarcely know where to begin!""Begin with what was in your mind when you wrote that note."May sat down close to him, and began in a low voice, little above awhisper, and with some confusion, to narrate the story of Mr. Bragg'swooing, and its effect on her aunt and uncle. As he listened, Owen'sface expressed the most unbounded amazement."Oh, it can't be!" he exclaimed. "It's impossible! There must be somemistake!"May laughed, though the tears were in her eyes. "You are not verycivil," she said. "Nobody else seemed to think it impossible.""But _old Bragg_!" repeated Owen incredulously."Perhaps he was temporarily insane, but I really think he meant it,"answered May, blushing so bewitchingly, that Owen could not resist thetemptation to kiss the glowing cheek so close to his lips.At this point, Harold called out in a resolute tone, "You mustn't kissMay."The lovers started. They had forgotten the children--had forgotteneverything in the world except each other. But the two little boys hadfollowed May into the room, and had been witnessing the interview indumb astonishment. It was characteristic that they now held each otherby the hand, as though seeking support from union, in the presence ofthis stranger, who might, they instinctively felt, turn out to be acommon enemy."Halloa!" said Owen. "Here's another rival. Their name seems to beLegion.""It was Harold who told me you were here," said May."Yes; I sent him to fetch you," answered Owen. Then he addedungratefully, "They might as well be sent off now, mightn't they?""Oh, let them stay. There are no secrets now. At least, I hope you willagree with me that we ought to say out the truth. Come here, Harold andWilfred. You must love Owen, for my sake."Harold advanced and stood in front of them."I say," he said, with a curious look at Owen, "I'm going to marry Maywhen I grow up.""_Are_ you? That's a little awkward.""Why is it a little awkward?" demanded Harold gravely."Well, because, to tell the truth, I was rather hoping to marry hermyself."The child had evidently intended to draw forth this explicit statement,for he looked full at Owen, and said doggedly, "I just thought youwere!" Then he suddenly turned away and hid his face on May's lap. Uponwhich Wilfred, conscious of a cloud in the air, began to cry softly."Don't be angry with them, poor little fellows!" said May, checking somemanifestation of impatience on Owen's part. Then she coaxed thechildren, and soothed them, and the childish emotion, brief thoughpoignant, soon passed. And at length Harold lifted up his face, and,after a short struggle, said--"I will shake hands with him, if you like, but I won't love him--not ifhe kisses you.""All right, old fellow," said Owen, taking the child's hand. "Isympathize with your feelings."Wilfred, of course, put out his small paw to be shaken like hisbrother's, and peace once more reigned.May then hurriedly--for she knew not how long they might remainuninterrupted--repeated what Clara Bertram had told her of her father'smarriage; and, lastly, she spoke in terms of deep affection andgratitude of "Granny's" generosity. But on this point, as we know, Owenwas already informed.All that he now heard strengthened and justified the strong inclinationhe already felt to abandon the idea of Buenos Ayres and to remain inEngland at all costs. With her father more completely cut off from hisfamily than ever by this new marriage, her aunt hostile, her uncle, tosay the least, dissatisfied, and sure to oppose her engagement when itshould be announced, and no one friend in the world to rely upon excepther grandmother, May's position would be very desolate if he, too, werefar away on the other side of the world. Mrs. Dobbs was the trustiestand most devoted of parents, but she was old; and, moreover, she wouldhave no power to insist on keeping May with her should her father takeit into his head to decide otherwise. No; he must and would remain athand to protect and watch over her. These were the sole considerationswhich decided him to come to this resolution then and there. But as soonas he had taken his resolution the thought arose pleasantly in his mindthat it would bring some cheerfulness into the household at CollingwoodTerrace, and he expressed it impulsively by saying all at once--"I have made up my mind, darling, to stay in London. Poor Mrs. Bransbywill be overjoyed. She is in such need of some one to stand by her."May felt a little chill, like the breath of a cold wind. In the firstwarm delight of seeing her lover again, all the lurking jealousy, whichshe hated herself for feeling, but which was alive in spite of her hate,had been forgotten. But his words revived it. "Is she?" she answered."Oh yes; I have not had time to tell you--haven't even _begun_ to saythe thousand things I want to say to you.""You could not have written them, I suppose?" said May, withdrawing herchair slightly from its close proximity to his, and thereby allowingHarold, who had been watching for this opportunity, to wedge himself inbetween them."No; I could not have written all about _her_, because I have only justheard many of the details.""All about '_her_'? You mean about Mrs. Bransby?""Of course. Poor soul, she has been so harshly, so cruelly treated!Theodore's conduct is----""You know I have no partiality for him," interrupted May. "But I thinkyou are a little unjust, or at least mistaken, in this instance.Theodore Bransby has done a great deal for his stepmother.""Done a great deal for her! Good Heavens, my dear child, you can'tconceive with what meanness he treats her! It's dastardly. A woman whowas so idolized, so tended, so petted----And what a sweet creature sheis! And as lovely as ever! Her sorrows seem only to have spiritualizedher beauty.""Yes," said May. And the dry monosyllable cost her a painful effort toutter it. Perhaps the constraint of her tone, the deadness of hermanner--naturally so warm and cordial--would have aroused Owen'ssurprise, and led to an explanation. But they were interrupted here bythe door being thrown open, not violently, but very wide open, and theappearance of Mrs. Dormer-Smith on the threshold.CHAPTER VI.Even in the moment of her first dismay, that admirable woman PaulineDormer-Smith was true to the great social duty of keeping upappearances. She turned her head over her shoulder to James, who washovering uneasily in the background, and said softly, "Oh yes; it _is_Mr. Owen Rivers. That is quite right"--as if Mr. Owen Rivers's presencewere the most natural and welcome thing in the world. Then, shutting thedoor on James and on society, she advanced towards the two young people,who had risen on her entrance, and said, with a kind of reproachfulfeebleness, conveying the impression that she was reduced to the laststage of debility, and that it was entirely their fault, "I had scarcelycredited the footman's statement that you were here having a privateinterview with my niece, Mr. Rivers. He tells me that he informed you ofthe family affliction which has befallen us. Under the circumstances,you must allow me to say that I think you have shown some want ofdelicacy in insisting on being admitted."May glanced at Owen, but as he did not speak on the instant, she did.She took her aunt's passive fingers in her own, and said, "Aunt Pauline,he had a right to insist on seeing me, because----""Excuse me, May," interrupted Mrs. Dormer-Smith, waving the girl off, "Ibeg you will go to your own room; _I_ will speak with this gentleman."Her tone would have suited the announcement that she was prepared toundergo martyrdom; and she sank into a chair in an attitude of gracefulexhaustion."No, Aunt Pauline, I _cannot_ go away until I have spoken," cried Maypleadingly. "Please to hear me. I wished to tell you the truth long ago,but I was bound by a promise; now we are both agreed that it is right tospeak out, are we not?" she said, looking across at Owen. It seemed toher that he was less eager to claim her, less proud of her affection,less ardently loving, than her imagination had pictured him. There wassomething in the quietude of his attitude which depressed and mortifiedher; it was like--almost like indifference. An insidious jealousy wasdiscolouring everything which she looked on with her "mind's eye." It isnot always a sufficient defence against a poison of that sort to have anoble, candid nature, any more than it is a sufficient defence againstfoul air to have sound, healthy lungs; it will fasten sometimes on theworthiest qualities: a humble opinion of ourselves, a high admirationfor others. The hinted slanders which May had heard had aroused no basersuspicion in her than that Owen perhaps did not love her so entirely ashe at first had fancied--that his sympathy and compassion and admirationfor Louisa Bransby were strong enough to compete with his attachment for_her_. And she knew by her own heart that if this were so his love wasnot such a love as she had dreamed of--not such a love as she had givento him. And yet all the while she was struggling against the influenceof this subtly-penetrating distrust, and trying to shake it off, like anugly dream."I am engaged to marry Owen Rivers," she said abruptly, after a pausewhich lasted but an instant, but which had seemed long to her."No, no; I must beg you to retire. I cannot hear this sort of thing,"returned her aunt, waving her hand again, and turning away her head."_You_, at least, must understand, Mr. Rivers, that it is entirely outof the question. How you can have entertained so preposterous an idea Icannot imagine. You must have seen something of the world, I presume?You ought to be able to perceive that--but, in short, the thing ispreposterous, and cannot be seriously discussed for a moment."May Cheffington's blood was rising. "I do not intend to discuss it," shesaid haughtily."Dearest, since your aunt addresses me, let me reply to her," said Owen.He spoke in a quiet tone, although inwardly he was excited and indignantenough. "I must tell you, Mrs. Dormer-Smith, that we are neither of usacting on a rash impulse. We have been parted for more than threemonths, during which time May has been free to give me up withoutbreaking any pledge, or incurring--from me, at least--any reproaches. Ifshe had wavered--if she had found that she had mistaken her ownfeelings--she was free as air. I should have made no claim, and laid noblame, on her.""Made no claim on her!" repeated Mrs. Dormer-Smith. Then she laughed thelow laugh which, with her, indicated the very extremity of provocation."Oh, really! Ha, ha, ha! This is too monstrous. The whole thing appearsto me like insanity.""To marry without loving--_that_ appears to me like insanity," said Mayscornfully."May! I beseech you! Really, in the mouth of a young girl of yourbreeding that sort of thing is inconceivable--I am tempted to use aharsher word. _This_ then, is the reason why you have rejected one ofthe most brilliant prospects! Are you aware, Mr. Rivers, that thisschool-girl nonsense has prevented----" She caught herself up hastily,and changed her phrase--"might have prevented Miss Cheffington fromobtaining one of the most splendid establishments in England?""Aunt Pauline!" cried May with hot indignation. "How can you say so? Iwould never have thought of marrying Mr. Bragg, even if Owen had notexisted!""But apart from that," pursued Mrs. Dormer-Smith, ignoring theinterruption, "your pretensions would have been quite inadmissible. Youhave heard of the death of my poor cousin Lucius. You had probablycalculated on it. I do not mean to bring any special accusation againstyou there. Of course, in the case of a person of poor dear Lucius'ssocial importance all sorts of calculations were made by all sorts ofpeople. My brother Augustus is now the next heir to the family title andestates. Under these circumstances I leave it to your own good sense todetermine whether he is likely to consent to his daughter'smarrying--really I am ashamed to speak of it seriously!--a person who,in however praiseworthy a manner, is filling the position of a hiredclerk!"This shaft fell harmless, since both May and her lover were honestlyfree from any sense of humiliation in the fact of Owen's being a hiredclerk, and sincerely willing to accept that position for him.Owen answered calmly, "You can probably judge far better than I, as towhat your brother is likely to think on that subject." Then turningtowards May, he said, "I think, my dearest, that you had better leaveyour aunt and me to speak quietly together. You have been sufficientlypained and agitated already. You look quite pale! Go, darling, and leaveme to speak with Mrs. Dormer-Smith.""Agitated!" echoed that lady. "We have all been sufficiently agitated.What I have endured from pressure on the brain is unspeakable. Certainlyyou had better go away, May, I have said so several times already."May walked slowly to the door. "I will do as you wish," she said toOwen."You see I am right, dear, do you not?""Yes; I suppose so."The listlessness of her tone, he interpreted as a sign of her beingweary and over-wrought. And, in truth, it was partly due to that cause.As she moved across the room, two little figures crept out from a darkcorner, behind an armchair, and followed her."Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Dormer-Smith faintly. "What is that? Havethose children been here all the time?" She always spoke of Harold andWilfred as "those children," in a distant tone as though they weresomebody else's intrusive little boys. On this occasion, however, shedid not altogether disapprove of their presence. It was certainly less_inconvenable_ that they should have been known by the servants to bepresent at the interview, than if May had been without even that smallamount of _chaperonage_. She had no idea that it was Harold who hadbrought about the interview, or he might not have got off so easily!"Go away, little boys," she said, in her sweet, soft voice. "Go awayupstairs. Cannot Cecile find some lessons for you to do? You really mustnot prowl about this part of the house in the afternoon."The children trotted after their cousin willingly enough. They neverwished to stay with their mother."We shall meet again soon, my dear one," whispered Owen, as he openedthe door. And then, with Mrs. Dormer-Smith's eyes fixedly regarding him,he took May's cold little hand in his own, and kissed it, before shepassed out.Pauline observed his demeanour with an unbiassed judgment. She would, inthe cause of duty, willingly have had him kidnapped and sent off to NewCaledonia at that moment. But she said to herself, "He has the manner ofa gentleman. It is most disastrous!" For she felt that this circumstanceincreased her own difficulties."Now, Mrs. Dormer-Smith," said Owen, when the door was shut, "I cananswer you with more perfect frankness than I should have liked toemploy in May's presence. You were so kind as to say that you wouldleave it to my good sense to determine whether Captain Cheffington waslikely to consent to my marriage with his daughter. My answer is quitesimple. I do not intend to ask his consent.""You do not intend--to ask--his consent?" ejaculated Pauline, leaningback in her chair, and, in the extremity of her astonishment at thisyoung man's audacity, letting fall a hand-screen which she had beenusing to shield her face from the fire.Owen picked it up and restored it to her before repeating, "No; I do notintend to ask his consent.""And do you hope to persuade my niece to disregard her father'sauthority?--Not to mention other members of the family who have a rightto be heard!""There is only one member of the family who has a right to beheard--Mrs. Dobbs. And her consent I hope I have obtained."Pauline was for the moment stricken speechless by hearing Mrs. Dobbsmentioned as a member of the family. "The family!" Good heavens, whatwas the world coming to? She pressed her hand to her forehead with abewildered look.Owen went on resolutely. "As to parental authority--Mrs. Dormer-Smith,your brother has abdicated all parental authority over May. He abandonedher--pardon me, I _must_ use that word; for it is the only one whichexpresses what I mean--when she was a young, motherless child. He wentaway to his own occupations, or pleasures--any way, he went to live hisown life in his own way, utterly careless of May's welfare andhappiness. You may tell me that he was sure of her finding the tenderesttreatment under her grandmother's roof. He was not sure of it; for henever troubled himself to consider the question. But if he had beensure, he had no right to leave his child as he did. At any rate, havingdone so, it is too late to pretend that she is morally bound to considerhis wishes."Pauline put her handkerchief to her eyes. "My poor brother Augustus ismuch to be pitied," she murmured. "Allowances must be made for a man inhis position. That unfortunate marriage----""I have never been told," said Owen, "that Miss Susan Dobbs seized uponCaptain Cheffington and compelled him by main force to marry her.And--judging from what I know of her mother and daughter--I should thinkit unlikely.""Oh, one understands that sort of thing," returned Pauline, with languiddisdain. "A young woman in her class of life is not to be judged by ourstandards. No doubt she thought herself justified in doing the best shecould for herself.""It strikes me that she did very badly for herself--lamentably badly. Ido not wish to say anything needlessly offensive, but we are in the wayof plain speaking, and I must point out to you that so far from anyconsideration being due to your brother, he is--from the point of viewof an honest man wishing to marry May--a person to be decidedly ashamedof. There are in the city of Oldchester, his late wife's native place,many tradesmen, and even mechanics, who would strongly object to connectthemselves by marriage with Captain Cheffington."To say that Mrs. Dormer-Smith was astonished by this speech would be butfaintly to express her sensations. She was bewildered. She had oftenheard Augustus severely blamed. She had been compelled to blame himherself. Of course he ought not to have thrown away his career as he haddone. They had agreed as to that. But all this blame had assumed thatAugustus had chiefly injured--firstly, himself; and in the second place,and more indirectly, the whole Cheffington family.Persons who live exclusively in any one narrow sphere are apt to have astrange simplicity, or ignorance, as one may choose to call it, as tolarge sections of their fellow-creatures outside that sphere. And in noclass is that kind of _naivete_ more commonly found than in the class towhich Mrs. Dormer-Smith belonged, where it is often intensified by theconviction that they possess what is called "knowledge of the world" ina supreme degree.It was far too late in the day to bring much enlightenment to Mrs.Dormer-Smith. Owen's words merely struck her mind with a shock of wonderand dismay, and then glanced off again. The impression of havingreceived a shock, however, did remain with her, and made her asresentful as was possible to her placid nature. In speaking of Mr.Rivers afterwards to her husband, she said--"I believe him, Frederick, to be a Nihilist."But for the present her mind was concentrated on the aim of breaking offwhat Owen chose to call his engagement to her niece, and she was not tobe turned aside from it. She addressed herself to argue the case withOwen. In argument she possessed the immense advantage--if it be anadvantage to reduce one's adversary to silence--of supposing that thestatement of any one truth on her part was a sufficient answer to anyother truth which might be advanced against her. As, for instance, whenOwen insisted on Captain Cheffington's having forfeited all moral claimto May's duty and affection, she replied that it was a dreadful thing toset a child against a parent; and when Owen denied the right of May'srelatives to prevent her from making a marriage of affection, sheretorted that Mr. Rivers came of undeniably gentle blood himself, andought to understand her (Mrs. Dormer-Smith's) strong family feeling.But when even this powerful kind of logic failed to make any impressionon Owen's obduracy, she changed her attack, and inquired what he wasprepared to offer to her niece, in exchange for the magnificent prospectof being Mrs. Joshua Bragg, with settlements and pin-money such as everyduke's daughter would desire, and very few dukes' daughters achieved."But, my dear madam," said Owen, "why speak of that alternative when Mayhas assured you, in my presence, that nothing would induce her to marryMr. Bragg?""Oh, Mr. Rivers, I am surprised you know so little of the world! May isa mere child: peculiarly childish for her age. Besides, even supposingshe definitively rejected Mr. Bragg, there will be other good matchesopen to her _now_. The death of my poor cousin Lucius has made a vastdifference in all that, as you must be well aware.""To me, Mrs. Dormer-Smith, it has made no difference. May is herself.That is why I love her. She is not in the least transfigured, in myimagination, by being the daughter of a man who may, or may not, be LordCastlecombe at some future day!""Oh," said Mrs. Dormer-Smith, shaking her head with the old plaintiveair, "you need not entertain any doubts as to my brother's succession.He is the next heir. And the estates--at least the bulk of them--areentailed.""Good heavens!" cried Owen, in despair, "can you not understand that Icare not one straw whether they are entailed or not? That I wouldproudly and joyfully make May my wife--she being what she is--if herfather trundled a barrow through the streets?"Whether Mrs. Dormer-Smith could, or could not, understand this, at anyrate she certainly did not believe it. She merely shook her head oncemore, and said softly--"I think you ought to consider her prospects a little, Mr. Rivers. Itappears to me that your views are entirely selfish."This seemed very hopeless. With a last effort to come to anunderstanding, Owen took refuge in a plain and categorical statement offacts. He had loved May when she was penniless. So far as he knew, shewas so still. He hoped to be able to offer her a modest home. She hadnot been accustomed to luxury or show--the season in London having beena mere episode, and not the main part of her life. Absolute destitutionthey were quite secure from.He possessed one hundred and fifty pounds a year of his own. (Paulinegave a little shudder at this. It positively seemed to her worse thannothing at all. With nothing certain in the way of income, a boundlessfield was left open for possibilities. But a hundred and fifty pounds ayear was a hard, hideous, circumscribing fact, like the bars of a cage!)He was receiving about as much again for his services as secretary.Moreover, he had tried his hand at literature, not unsuccessfully. Hehad earned a few pounds by his pen already, and hoped to earn more. Thatwas the state of the case. If May, God bless her! were content with it,he submitted that no one else could fairly object.Mrs. Dormer-Smith rose from her chair, to signify that the interview wasat an end. Indeed, what use could there be in prolonging it?"I confess," she said, "you have astonished me, Mr. Rivers. If May--aninexperienced young girl not yet nineteen--is content, you think no oneelse has a right to interfere! At that rate, if she chose to marry thefootman, we must all stand by without raising a finger to prevent it.That is, certainly, very extraordinary doctrine."Owen drew himself up, and looked full at her with those blue eyes, whichcould shine so fiercely upon occasion as he answered--"I have already admitted the right of one person to be consulted aboutMay's future:--the benevolent, unselfish, high-minded woman, whobefriended her, and cherished her, and was a mother to her, when she wasdeserted by every one else. As to her marrying the footman--it is clear,madam, that she might have married the hangman, for all the effort _you_would have made to prevent it, until Mrs. Dobbs bribed you to take somenotice of your niece! But in marrying a Rivers of Riversmead I need not,I suppose, inform you that she will confer on you the honour of aconnection with a race of gentlemen compared with whom--if we are tostand on genealogies--half the names in the Peerage are a merefungus-growth of yesterday."It was the first word he had said to her which was less than courteouslyforbearing. And it was the first word which gave her a momentary twingeof regret that his suit was altogether inadmissible. She contrasted hisbearing with that of May's two other wooers:--Bransby the smooth, andBragg the unpolished; and she said to herself with a sigh, that therewas no doubt about this young man's pedigree, and that "_bon sang nepeut mentir_." But not therefore did she flinch from her position. Sheanswered him in the same words she had used years ago to her brother, inthat very room."It will not do, Mr. Rivers. I assure you, it will not do!"Then she bent her head with quiet grace, and moved to go away."One instant, Mrs. Dormer-Smith!" Owen said, following her to the doorof the dining-room. "I wish, if you please, to speak with May againbefore I go away.""Impossible. I cannot, compatibly with my duty, consent to your seeingher now, or at any future time.""Am I to understand that you forbid me your house?""If you please. Unless, indeed, you consent to come in any othercharacter than as my niece's suitor. In that case it would give me greatpleasure to receive you as I have done before."He stood looking at her rather blankly. The position was undeniablyawkward. It was impossible--for May's sake, if from no otherconsideration--to make a scene of violence, and insist upon seeing her.And, even if he did so, Mrs. Dormer-Smith might still resist. She wasmistress of the situation so far. Even in his vexation and perplexity,the ludicrous side of the affair struck him."Well," said he, after a moment, taking up his hat, "I cannot intrudeinto your house against your will. Our only resource must be to meetelsewhere. I warn you we shall do so. Of course, it is idle to supposethat you have the power to keep us apart."Mrs. Dormer-Smith shook her head, and repeated with gentle obstinacy,"It will not do, Mr. Rivers. I really am very sorry, but it will _not_do.""War, then, is declared between us?""Oh, I hope not! I trust you will think better of it," she said in amildly persuasive tone, as though she were suggesting that he shouldleave off tea, or take to woollen clothing. "_I_, at least, have nowarlike intentions, Mr. Rivers; for I am going to ask you to do me afavour. Be so very kind as to wait until I ring, and let my servant showyou out in a civilized manner. It is quite unnecessary to publish ourdifferences of opinion to the servants' hall."Accordingly she rang the bell, and, when James appeared, said sweetly,in an audible voice, "Good-bye, Mr. Rivers." Whereupon Owen made her aprofound bow, and departed.As he passed through the hall, he looked about him wistfully in the hopethat May might be lingering near--might possibly be looking down fromthe upper part of the staircase. But she did not appear. The house wasprofoundly silent. James stood waiting with the door in his hand. Therewas no help for it. He strode away with various conflicting feelings,thoughts, projects, and hopes struggling in his mind--of which theuppermost at that special moment was a strong inclination to burst outlaughing.CHAPTER VII.It was not until Owen had nearly reached Collingwood Terrace that thethought struck him, "What if Mr. Bragg should withdraw his countenancefrom him, and dismiss him from his employment, when he learned that hewas betrothed to May?"The idea of Mr. Bragg in the light of a rival disconcerted and confusedall his previous conceptions of his employer. At the first blush it hadappeared ludicrous--incredible; but, on reflection, there was, he found,nothing so extravagant in it. Mr. Bragg had a right to seek a wife toplease himself; he was but little past middle life, after all; and as tothe disparity in years between him and May, that was certainly notunprecedented. He had taken his rejection well, and manfully--even witha touch of chivalry; but he might not, any the more, be disposed tocontinue his favour towards Owen when he should discover the state ofthe case. He might even suspect that there had been some kind of plot todeceive him! That was a very uncomfortable thought, and sent the bloodtingling through Owen's veins.There was clearly but one thing to be done--to tell Mr. Bragg the truthat all hazards. As he walked along the pavement within a few hundredyards of Mrs. Bransby's door, he reflected that the revelation wouldcome better and more gracefully from May than from himself, he was notsupposed to be aware of what had passed between May and Mr. Bragg--itwas best that he should still seem to ignore it. He had a sympatheticsense that Mr. Bragg's wounded feelings might endure May's delicatehandling, while they would shrink resentfully from any masculine touch.Owen regretted now more than ever that he had not seen May again beforeleaving her aunt's house; they had had no time to consult together, orto form any plan of action for the future. Their interview seemed, inOwen's recollection, to have passed like a swift gleam of light in a skyover which the clouds are flying. (It had, in sober fact, lasted abovehalf an hour before Mrs. Dormer-Smith's appearance on the scene.) Andnow he was forbidden the house! Forbidden to see her! And yet he toldhimself over and over again that he could not have acted otherwise thanhe had acted at the time. Well, it was too absurd to suppose that shecould be treated as a prisoner. They must meet soon, and meanwhile therewas a penny post in the land, and her letters, at least, would not betampered with. He would write to her the moment he got home; she wouldreceive his letter the next morning, and by that same afternoon shecould put Mr. Bragg in possession of the fact of her engagement.And after she had done so----The "afterwards" seemed hazy, certainly. But at least there was no doubtas to the plain duty of both of them not to keep their engagement anylonger secret from Mr. Bragg. It was a comfort to see clearly the rightcourse as regarded the steps immediately before them. For the rest--theyhad youth and hope, and they loved each other!Owen let himself into the house with his latch-key, and went straight tohis own room to write to May. When the note was finished, he took it outand posted it, and then proceeded to the sitting-room.The table was spread for tea; all the tea equipage bright and glisteningas cleanliness could make it. A cheerful fire burned in the grate. Bobbyand Billy, seated side by side on a couple of low stools in one corner,were occupied with a big book full of coloured pictures. Ethel wassewing. Martin stood leaning against the mantelpiece close to hismother's armchair. And in a chair at the opposite corner of the hearthsat Mr. Bragg, with Enid on his knee!When Owen entered, Mr. Bragg said, "Well, Mr. Rivers, you see I've foundmy way to Mrs. Bransby's. I ought to have come and paid her my respectsbefore now. But _you_ know I've had my hands pretty full since I cameback to England."Something in his tone and his look seemed to convey a hint to be silentas to their conversation of that morning; and accordingly Owen made noallusion to it."It is so pleasant to see an Oldchester face, is it not?" said Mrs.Bransby."_Some_ Oldchester faces," returned Owen, laughing. Then he said, "Well,Enid, have you not a word to say to me? Won't you come and give me akiss?"Miss Enid, who was a born coquette, and who was, moreover, greatlyinterested in Mr. Bragg's massive watch-chain and seal, replied withimperious brevity, "No; don't want to."Mr. Bragg looked down gravely on the small creature, and then up atOwen, as he said--half shyly, and yet with a certain tinge ofcomplacency, "Why, she _would_ come and set on my knee, almost the firstminute she saw me.""Perhaps you had better get down, baby," said Mrs. Bransby. "I am afraidshe may be troublesome.""Troublesome? Lord, no! Why, I don't feel she's there, no more than afly. Let her bide," said Mr. Bragg."Ah, _I_ know what she is:--she's fickle," observed Owen, drawing up hischair."_Not_ pickle!" declared Miss Enid, with great majesty."Yes, you are! False, fleeting, perjured Enid!" said Owen.He was delighted to perceive that the little home and its inmates hadevidently made a favourable impression on Mr. Bragg. Observing thatgentleman in the new light of May's revelation, he saw something in hisface which he had not seen there before:--a regretful, far-away look,whenever he was not speaking, or being spoken to. It was wonderfullystrange, certainly, to think of him as May's wooer! And yet not absurd,as it had appeared at first. In Mr. Bragg's presence, the absurdity,somehow, vanished. The simplicity and reality of the man gave himdignity. Owen even began to feel something like a vague and respectfulcompassion for Mr. Bragg; and every now and then the peculiarity oftheir mutual position would come over him with a fresh sense ofsurprise."We have been having a little conversation, Mrs. Bransby and me, abouther boy here," said Mr. Bragg, glancing across at Martin, who coloured,and smiled with repressed eagerness. Mr. Bragg continued to observe himthoughtfully. "He tells me he wants to help his mother; and he's notafraid or ashamed of work, it seems.""Ashamed!" broke out Martin. "No, I hope I ain't such a cad as that!""Martin!" cried his mother anxiously. She was nervous lest he shouldgive offence.But Mr. Bragg answered with a little nod, which certainly did notexpress disapprobation, "Well, the boy's about right. To be ashamed ofthe wrong things, does belong to--what you might call a cad. I expect,"pursued Mr. Bragg musingly, "that if we could always apply our shame inthe right place, we should all of us do better than we do.""I suppose I dare not offer you any tea at this hour?" said Mrs. Bransbygently. "You have not dined, of course.""Well, no; not under the _name_ of dinner, I haven't! But I ate a heartyluncheon; and I believe that's about as much dinner as I want; to do meany good, you know. I'll have a cup of tea, please."Mrs. Bransby certainly felt no misapplied shame as to the humbleness andpoverty of her surroundings; and was far too truly a gentlewoman tothink of apologizing for them. Ethel, who was growing to be quite anotable little housewife, quietly fetched another cup and saucer fromthe kitchen; and that was all the difference which Mr. Bragg's presencemade in the ordinary arrangements.Enid insisted on having her high chair placed close to Mr. Bragg attable; and, but for her sister's watchful interposition, she would havedemonstrated her sudden affection for him by transferring sundry morselsof bread-and-butter which she had been tightly squeezing in her smallfingers from her plate to his, with the patronizing remark, "Oo havedat. I can't eat any more."While the meal was still in progress there came a knock at the streetdoor. It was a very peculiar knock; consisting of two or three sharpraps, followed by one solemn rap, and then--after an appreciableinterval--by several more hurried little raps, as if the hand at theknocker had forgotten all about its previous performances, and werebeginning afresh."Who can this be?" said Mrs. Bransby, looking up in surprise. Visitorsat any time were rare with her now; and at that hour, unprecedented."Old Bucher come back to say he can't live without us," suggestedMartin.Whereupon Bobby and Billy, with consternation in their faces, exclaimedsimultaneously, "Oh, I _say_!" And Enid, perceiving the generalattention to be diverted from her, took that opportunity to polish thebowl of her spoon, by rubbing it softly against Mr. Bragg's coat sleeve.The family were not kept long in suspense. As soon as the door wasopened, a well-known voice was heard saying volubly, "Ah! at tea, arethey? Well, never mind! Take in my card, if you please, and----Dear me!I haven't got one! But if you will kindly say, an old friend fromOldchester begs leave to wait on Mrs. Bransby.""Why, it's Simmy!" cried the children, starting up, and rushing to thedoor. "Here's a lark!" exclaimed Bobby. While Billy, tugging at thevisitor's skirt, roared out hospitably, "Come along! Mother's in there.Come in! Mother, here's Simmy!"Mrs. Sebastian Bach Simpson it was. She appeared on thethreshold--rubicund visage, glittering spectacles, filmy curls, andgirlish giggle, all as usual; and began to apologize for what she calledher "unauthorized yet perhaps not wholly inexcusable intrusion," withher old amiability and incoherency. She had come prepared to keep up acheerful mien, having decided, in her own mind, not to distress thefeelings of the family by any lachrymose allusions. But when Mrs.Bransby rose up to welcome her, and not only took her by the hand, butkissed her on the cheek, and led her towards the place of honour inthe armchair, this proceeding so overcame the kind-hearted creaturethat she abruptly turned her back on them all, pulled out herpocket-handkerchief, and burst into tears."I really must apol--apologize," she sobbed, still presenting the broadback of a very smart shawl to the company--an attitude which made herelaborate politeness extremely comical; for she addressed her speechpoint-blank to the wall-paper, with abundance of bows and gestures. "Iam ashamed, indeed. Pray excuse me! The suddenness of the emo--emotion,and the sight of the dear children, coupled with--I believe--a slighttouch of the prevalent influenza, but nothing in the least infectious,dear Mrs. Bransby! But pray do not allow me to disturb the harmony ofthis fest--festive meeting with 'most admired disorder,' as our immortalbard puts it! Although what there is to admire in disorder, and whoadmired it, must probably remain for ever ambiguous."By the end of this speech--the utterance of which had been interruptedby several interludes of pocket-handkerchief--Mrs. Simpson wassufficiently composed to turn round, and take the chair offered to her.The children were grinning undisguisedly. "Simmy" was associated intheir minds with many pleasant and many comical recollections. Mrs.Bransby was smiling too. But perhaps it was only the warning spectacleof Mrs. Simpson's emotion which enabled her to choke down her owninclination to cry."This is a most pleasant surprise," she said. "When did you arrive inLondon?""Why, the fact is----" began Amelia. But suddenly interrupting herself,she jumped up from her seat, and made Mr. Bragg a sweeping curtsey."Pardon me," she exclaimed, "if, in the first moment, I was oblivious ofyour presence! Although not personally acquainted, Oldchester peopleclaim the privilege of recognizing Mr. Bragg as one of our nativeproducts. An unforeseen honour, indeed! And--do my eyes deceive me, orhave I the pleasure of greeting Mr. Owen Rivers? What an extraordinarycoincidence! I had _heard_ you were residing here in the character of aboarder," she added, as emphatically as though that were an obviousreason for being surprised to see him there. "Really, I seem to betransported back into our ancient city; and should scarcely start tohear the cathedral chimes, or the steam-whistle from the brewery, or anyof the dear familiar sounds--although the steam whistle, I must admit,is trying, and, in certain forms of nervous disorder, I believe,excruciating."It was not easy, at any time, to obtain a clear and collected answer toa question from Mrs. Simpson. But in her present state of excitement thedifficulty was immensely increased. Her language--partly in honour ofMr. Bragg--was so flowery, and she kept darting up every discursivecross-alley which opened out of the main line of talk in so bewilderinga fashion, as to become at moments unintelligible. And it was a longtime before any of the party elicited from her how it was that she cameto be in London. At length, however, it appeared that "Bassy" wasentrusted with a commission to buy a pianoforte; and having found asubstitute to take his organ and attend to his pupils for a week, he andhis wife had suddenly resolved to take a holiday in London together."I had, of course, intended to seek you out, dear Mrs. Bransby," shesaid; "ever mindful, as I must be, of the many kind favours I havereceived from you and"--here she gulped dangerously; but recoveredherself and went on--"from all the family. But we came away in such ahurry at the last, a cheap excursion train being, in fact, our immediatemotive.""Locomotive," put in Martin jocosely."Quite so," said Amelia, with the utmost suavity. "A very propercorrection." Then, seeing his mischievous face dimpling with laughter,she exclaimed, "Oh, of course!--_locomotive_. Very good, Martin! Ah, Iam as absent as ever, you see!" Here she playfully shook her head untilsundry metallic bobs upon her bonnet fell off, and had to be hunted forand picked up. "Well, so it was. I was hurried away by Bassy'simpetuosity--although, in justice to him, I must state that the timebills were peremptory, and there was no margin for delay ordeliberation--almost without a carpet bag! I had no opportunity,therefore, of inquiring of any mutual friend in Oldchester for youraddress.""There are scarcely any who know it, or care to know it," said Mrs.Bransby, in a low voice."Oh, pardon me, dear Mrs. Bransby! No, no; that must not be said, forthe honour of Oldchester! Your memory is affectionately cherished by allthe more refined and sympathetic souls among us. Only last week Mr.Crump, the butcher, was respectfully inquiring for news of you. Youremember Crump! A worthy man, whose spirit--notwithstanding the dictumof the Swan of Avon--is by no means 'subdued to what it works in,'beyond a transient greasiness, which lies merely on the surface.""Yes; I remember him very well. But who, then, was it who directed youto this house?" asked Mrs. Bransby, hoping that her guest was not awarewhy Martin had suddenly retired behind the window curtains in a paroxysmof laughter."Ah! That, again, is one of the most extraordinary circumstances! Who doyou think it was?""I cannot tell at all.""Guess!""Miss Piper, perhaps," suggested Ethel."Not _exactly_ Miss Piper," said Mrs. Simpson, with strong emphasis onthe qualifying adverb, as though her informant's identity were onlybarely distinguishable from that of Miss Piper. "But you burn, Ethel!You are very near. However, I will not keep you longer in suspense. Itwas Miss Clara Bertram.""Oh! I might have thought of her, for she is a neighbour of ours," saidMrs. Bransby."Is she?" asked Owen."Yes; she lives in a house with a rather good garden, not far from here.The situation is a little inconvenient for her profession, I fancy. Butshe has invalid relatives, to whom the garden is a great boon. We metaccidentally in the street one day, and she recognized me at once. I wassurprised that she did so.""Nay, _I_ should rather have been surprised had she forgotten you," saidMrs. Simpson, "'For the heart,'" dear Mrs. Bransby, "'that once trulyloves, _never_ forgets, but as fondly loves on to the----' Not, ofcourse, that there was anything beyond the very slightest acquaintancebetween you and Miss Bertram in Oldchester. Bassy is, in fact, at herhouse now, with a few musical professors, whom she kindly invited us tomeet--the artistic element which is so akin to Bassy's soul--combinedwith the seductions of the Indian weed, of which Miss Bertram's papa isquite a devotee--so that, you see, finding you were so near, I slippedaway to see you; and I have promised to return before it is time to goback to the boarding-house where we are staying."At this point Mr. Bragg got up to take his leave."I shall look in again before long, Mrs. Bransby, if you'll allow me,"he said; "and we'll have a little more talk about my young friend there.Good night to you, ma'am," turning to shake hands with Mrs. Simpson.This brought that lady "to her legs" in more senses than one. Shefavoured Mr. Bragg with a long and enthusiastic address, embracing anextraordinary variety of topics, from the proud pre-eminence of Britishcommerce, to the force of friendship as portrayed in the classicalexample of Damon and Pythias."I will not ask, in the beautiful words of the Caledonian ditty, 'Shouldauld acquaintance be forgot, and days o' lang syne?' for I am certainthat you are entirely incapable of doing anything of the sort, as isproved by your presence beneath this refined roof-tree," said Mrs.Simpson. "But I _must_ bear my humble testimony to the eminent virtuesof our exquisite friend--if I may be allowed the privilege of callingher so. I have seen her basking in prosperity, and unspoiled by thesmiles of fortune, and now in the cold shade of comparatively untowardcircumstances, she beams with the same congenial lustre. In short,"cried Amelia, suddenly abandoning what Bobby and Billy called her"dictionary" style for a homelier language which came straight from herheart, "a better wife and mother, a gentler mistress, a kinder friendthere never was, or could be, in this world."Owen offered to accompany Mr. Bragg in order to show him the way to thenearest cabstand, and they left the house together."She's a sing'lar character," observed Mr. Bragg, after they had walkeda few steps."You mean Mrs. Simpson?""Ah, yes; Mrs. Simpson. There's too much clack about her; and her talk'spuzzling from being--what you might call of a zigzag sort of a nature;and she's cast in a queer kind of a mould altogether. But I think sherings true, and that's the main thing, in mortals or metals.""I'm quite sure her praise of Mrs. Bransby is true, at any rate," saidOwen warmly."H'm!" grunted Mr. Bragg, and walked on in silence. When they camewithin view of a cabstand, he turned round, and said he would nottrouble Owen to come any further with him. And just as the latter wasabout to say "Good-night," Mr. Bragg observed meditatively, "She hasthat little place beautifully neat, and as clean as a new pin. Seems tobe bringing up those children in the right way, too. Poor soul! it's aheavy charge for a delicate lady like her. I think I shall be able to dosomething for that eldest boy. But p'r'aps you'd better not say anythingat present--eh? It's cruel to raise up false hopes; and some folks buildsuch a wonderful high scaffolding of expectations on a word or two; andif there's not bricks enough to do anything adequate to thescaffolding--why, then that's awkward. Good night, Mr. Rivers."Owen well knew that hopes had already been aroused by the mere presenceof the rich man in that poor little home. But he knew, also, that therewas no danger of Mrs. Bransby's hopes turning into claims; and that shewould be humbly grateful for very small help. He felt almost elated onher behalf as he returned to Collingwood Terrace. "I only hope," he saidto himself, "that Mr. Bragg won't visit any of my sins on Mrs. Bransby'shead, when he finds them out! But no; to do the old boy justice, Ibelieve he is above that."Meanwhile, Amelia Simpson had been imparting a budget of Oldchesternews. After many discursive sallies she came to the topic of LuciusCheffington's recent death. He had died since the Simpsons' departurefrom Oldchester, but his case had been known to be hopeless for severaldays previous. The old lord was said to be dreadfully cut up; more so,even, than on the death of his eldest son. But Lucius had always beenunderstood to be his father's favourite."And they do say," continued Mrs. Simpson, "that to a certain fair youngfriend of ours the blow will be very severe.""A young friend of ours! Do you mean May Cheffington?""Ah, no! Our dear Miranda knew scarcely anything of her noble relativesat Combe Park. And even the _most_ affectionate disposition--and I'msure our dear Miranda is imbued with every proper feeling--can scarcelycling with personal devotion to an almost total stranger, althoughunited by the ties of kindred! No; I was speaking of Miss Hadlow.""Constance!""Yes, although I have never been on terms to address her by herbaptismal appellation, that, I confess, is the young lady I _do_ mean."Then Mrs. Simpson went on to tell her astonished listener how thatConstance Hadlow had been visiting some county magnates in the nearneighbourhood of Combe Park during the latter part of Lucius's illness;how she had been admitted to see and talk with the invalid, when otherpersons had been excluded with scant courtesy; how she had rapidly cometo be on a footing of intimacy at the great house, which astonished theneighbourhood; and how at length that fact was explained by the currentreport that if Lucius had recovered--which at one time appeared notunlikely--he would have married her, with his father's full approbation."I did not venture to allude to the subject before Mr. Rivers--how brownhe has become! Quite the southern hue of romance!--because, you know, hewas said at one time to be desperately in love with his cousin; and Ifeared to hurt his feelings.""Oh, I don't think it would hurt his feelings," said Mrs. Bransby; "Ireally do not believe he cares at all for his cousin, in that way.""I'm sure he doesn't!" cried Ethel, who took a thoroughly feminineinterest in the subject."Ethel! I scarcely think you know anything at all about the matter. AndI am sure it is not for a little girl like you to give an opinion.""No, mother. Only--Martin and I know who we should _like_ him to marry.Don't we, Martin?"Martin was rather shamefaced at being thus brought publicly into thediscussion, and rebuffed his sister with a lofty air."Oh, don't talk bosh and silliness," he rejoined. "Girls are alwaysbothering about a fellow's getting married. Leave him alone. He's verywell as he is.""He is certainly most affable, and thoroughly the gentleman," observedMrs. Simpson, with her universal, beaming benevolence."Oh, he is good!" cried the widow, clasping her hands. "So delicatelyconsiderate! Such a true, loyal friend!"In her own mind she was convinced that Mr. Bragg's visit was entirelydue to Owen's influence. And her heart was overflowing with gratitude.A new idea darted into Mrs. Simpson's imagination, always ready toaccept a romantic view of things. How charming it would be if young Mr.Rivers were to marry the beautiful widow! They would make a delightfulcouple. Considerations of ways and means entered no more into Mrs.Simpson's calculations than they would have entered into little Enid's.The building of her castles in the air was entirely independent ofmoney.But there was, at bottom, a more common sensible reason which made theidea that Owen might marry Mrs. Bransby, agreeable to Amelia Simpson. Inspite of the sympathy of Mr. Crump, the butcher, and other congenialspirits, it could not be denied that some rumours of a very unpleasantsort had recently been circulated in Oldchester to the discredit of Mrs.Bransby. When it became known that young Rivers, on his return fromSpain, was to live in her house, the rumours began to take a moredefinite shape. No one could trace them to their source--perhaps no onetried very seriously to do so.People asked each other if they had not always thought there wassomething a little odd--not quite becoming and _nice_--in the way thatyoung Rivers used to be running in and out of Martin Bransby's house, atall times and seasons. Even during poor Mr. Bransby's lifetime, strangethings had been said--at least, it now appeared so; for very few of thegossips professed to have heard any whispers of scandal _themselves_,while Martin lived. There was a strange story of young Rivers beingcaught kissing Mrs. Bransby's hand in the garden. There might be no harmin kissing a lady's hand. But, under the circumstances, there wassomething, almost revolting, was there not? And, then, why was Mrs.Bransby in such a hurry to run away from Oldchester?--away from all herfriends and all her husband's friends? Surely she would have done betterto remain there! At all events Mr. Theodore Bransby had been muchannoyed by her doing so; and had replied to old friends, who spoke tohim on the subject, that he could not control his step-mother's actions;could only advise her for the best; and should endeavour to assist herand her children, _if she would allow him to do so_. Of course peopleunderstood when he said that, that Mrs. Bransby was acting contrary tohis judgment. And now, Mr. Rivers was actually going to reside in herhouse! It positively was not decent! No wonder Theodore lookeddistressed, and avoided the subject. It must be altogether a verypainful affair for him.This kind of scandal, with its inevitable _crescendo_, had been verydifferently received by Sebastian Simpson and his wife. He could not besaid to encourage it; but neither did he repudiate it indignantly. ButAmelia was true and devoted to Mrs. Bransby, and incurred someunpopularity by her enthusiastic praises of that absent lady. But therewere also people who said what a good creature Mrs. Simpson was, andthat--although she was a goose, and had probably been quite takenin--they liked to see her stand up for those who had been kind to her.Under these circumstances, it was a great triumph for Amelia to find Mr.Bragg--the respectable, the influential, the _rich_ Mr. Bragg--visitingMrs. Bransby on a friendly footing, and treating her with markedkindness and respect. Simple though she might be, Amelia was not at alltoo simple to understand that the millionaire's approbation would carryweight with it. But now the idea of a marriage between Owen and thewidow seemed still more delightful than the mere clearing of Mrs.Bransby's character from all aspersions. People had said that, as for_him_, the young man was probably suffering under a temporaryinfatuation. And that, even supposing the best, and taking the mostcharitable view of this--_flirtation_, it was out of the question thathe should think of marrying a woman of Mrs. Bransby's age, and with fivechildren to support!Why should it be out of the question? Amelia said to herself. The fewyears' difference in their ages was of no consequence at all. And as tothe family--Mr. Bragg would probably take Owen into partnership. He wasevidently devotedly fond of them both! She had privately arranged thedetails of the wedding in her own mind before Owen returned fromconducting Mr. Bragg to his cab.When he did so, Mrs. Simpson declared it was time for her to go, and gotup from her chair. But between that and her actual departure a greatmany words had still to intervene. She reverted to the death in theCastlecombe family; made a brief excursion to the report of CaptainCheffington's second marriage, "truly deplorable! But still, or dearMiranda is happily launched among the _elite_ of the _beau_ _monde_, so,perhaps, it is not so bad after all!" And then suddenly added--"By the way, dear Mrs. Bransby, it _was_ reported that your step-son,Mr. Theodore, intended to withdraw his candidature at the next election.But I am told on the _best_ authority--Mr. Lowe, the politicalagent--that that is a mistake. So I hope we may see him among thelegislators. Quite the figure for it, I'm sure. However, of course, youmust know all that news far better than I. I hope to _see_ our dearMiranda before leaving town."Owen observed, with indignation, that the mention of Theodore appearedto have suggested May to her mind. Nor did the circumstance escape Mrs.Bransby."Do you say you shall see May Cheffington?" she asked."Yes; I purpose calling. Although well aware of Mrs. Dormer-Smith's highsocial position, still I think our dear Miranda's warm heart willwelcome one who has so recently seen her beloved grandmamma. Ah, we donot easily relinquish the fond memories of childhood. Thank you, my dearEthel. _Is_ that my pocket-handkerchief? Really! I wonder how it camethere!" (Ethel had picked it up from under the tea-table.) "I believethat even in the princely halls--I _think_ I left my umbrella in thepassage. Eh? Oh, Bobby has found it--in the princely halls ofCastlecombe her memory will revert to Friar's Row. In the words of thepoet, 'though strangers may roam, those hills and those valleys I oncecalled my home'--although, of course, Oldchester is _not_ mountainous.And as to roaming, I presume that hills and valleys are always more orless liable to be roamed over by strangers, whether one calls them one'shome or not."By this time Mrs. Simpson had got herself out of the room into thenarrow outer passage; and, seeing Owen put on his great coat again, inorder to escort her, she stopped to protest against his taking thattrouble."Oh, pray! _Too_ kind! It is but a stone's throw from here, and I am notat all afraid. Sure of the way? Well, no; not _quite_ sure. I took twowrong turnings in coming. But I can easily inquire for MarlboroughHouse. Eh? Oh, Blenheim Lodge is it? To be sure! Marlborough House isthe august residence----However, _historically_ speaking I was not sofar wrong, was I? Well, if you insist, Mr. Rivers, I will accept yourpolite attention with gratitude. Good-bye, once more, dear children. IfI possibly can come again before leaving London, dear Mrs. Bransby----"At this point Owen perceived that decisive measures were necessary, ifthe good lady's farewells were not to last until midnight. He took Mrs.Simpson's arm, signed to Phoebe to open the door, and led his faircharge outside it, almost before she knew what was happening."Excuse me for hurrying you," he said; "but the night is cold; Mrs.Bransby is not very strong; and I thought it imprudent--for both ofyou--to stand talking in that draughty passage.""Oh, _quite_ right. Thank you a thousand times. She is deserving,indeed, of every delicate care and attention."A slighter circumstance would have sufficed to confirm Mrs. Simpson'sromantic fancies. She said to herself that Mr. Rivers's devotion waschivalrous indeed. And she forthwith proceeded to sound Mrs. Bransby'spraises, in an unbroken stream of eloquence, all the way to BlenheimLodge. Owen had intended to ask her one or two questions--about Mrs.Dobbs, and as to when she thought of calling at Mrs. Dormer-Smith'shouse. He had even held a half-formed intention of entrusting her with amessage for May. But it was hopeless to arrest her flow ofspeech--unless by making his request in a more serious fashion than hethought it prudent to do. Amelia's goodwill might be relied on. But shewas absolutely devoid of discretion. And, at all events, if he saidnothing, there would be no ground for her to build a blunder on.He little knew!CHAPTER VIII.When Mrs. Dormer-Smith practised any deception--a necessity whichunfortunately arose rather frequently in the prosecution of her duty tosociety--she was wont to call it diplomacy. She called it so to herself,in her most private cogitations. She was not a woman whose consciencecould be satisfied by any but the best chosen phraseology.In speaking to May of her conversation with Owen, she gave a"diplomatic" version of it. It was May herself who innocently suggestedthe line her aunt took. When she found that Owen had left the housewithout any further farewell to her, she said not a word, she demandedno explanation; but the disappointed look in her eyes, the droopingcurves of her young mouth, were sufficiently eloquent. Had she fired upinto indignation against her aunt, assuming as a matter of course thatOwen had been refused permission to see her again, that would haveseemed quite in accordance with her character. This was, in fact, whatPauline had prepared herself to meet. But this quietude was strange. Itseemed as though May were _ready_ to be wounded. Her aunt thought thatit would not have occurred to the girl--who was high-spirited enough incertain directions--to suspect that her lover might be less eager to seeher again than she was to see him, unless some previous fact or fancyhad put the suspicion into her head. Fact or fancy, Mrs. Dormer-Smiththought it mattered little which, so long as the suspicion were there.Of course it would not do to pretend that Owen had not asked to see her.That would be a clumsy falsehood, sure of speedy detection; and,besides, Mrs. Dormer-Smith wished to avoid explicit falsehood. She wasonly diplomatic."I was obliged, I need scarcely tell you, May," she said, "to refuse Mr.Rivers's request for some more words with you. It would have been agross dereliction of duty on my part to permit it.""He did ask to see me, then?" said May, with a bright eager look in hereyes. It was a look her aunt was well acquainted with, and usuallypresaged some speech which had to be deplored as being "odd," or "badform.""Oh yes," replied Mrs. Dormer-Smith wearily. "Of course, he asked; I hadto go through all that. Under the circumstances he could scarcely doless."The shadow of the eyelashes suddenly drooped down over the bright eyes;and Aunt Pauline saw that her shot had told."Has it ever occurred to you, May," Mrs. Dormer-Smith went on, "that youare prejudicing the future of this gentleman?"May looked up quickly, but made no answer."Of course, it cannot be allowed to go on--this _engagement_, as heabsurdly terms it.""It is an engagement," interrupted May in a low voice.Her aunt passed over the interruption, and continued. "But I think thatin justice to him you ought to reflect that meanwhile you are injuringhis prospects. I do not mean," she added with gentle sarcasm, "that youwill injure him by preventing him from marrying the Widow Bransby;because I cannot honestly say that I think _that_ a good prospect forany young man.""All those stories are malicious falsehoods," said May resolutely; buther throat was painfully constricted, and her heart felt like lead inher breast."My dear child, one scarcely sees why people should trouble themselvesto _invent_ stories about this lady and gentleman, who, after all, arepersons of very small importance. But at any rate the stories arecirculated, and believed. Under these circumstances it seems to mea--well, to say the least, an indiscreet proceeding, that Mr. Rivers,the moment he returns to England, should rush to Mrs. Bransby's house,and take up his abode there! However, it may be quite a usual sort ofthing among persons in their position. Very likely. I only know that in_our_ world it would not do. We are less Arcadian. When I spoke ofinjuring Mr. Rivers's prospects, I meant as between him and hisemployer.""Oh!" cried May, turning round with a pale indignant face. A confusedcrowd of words seemed to be struggling in her mind; but she was unable,for the moment, to utter one of them."_Dear_ May," said her aunt, "do not, I beg and implore you, do not betragic! I don't think I _could_ stand that sort of thing. It would bethe last straw.""Do you think--do you mean that Mr. Bragg would turn Owen away, out ofspite?" asked May in a quiet tone, after a short silence."We need not employ such a word as that. But Mr. Bragg made you an offerof marriage, and we can hardly expect him to find it pleasant when he istold 'the young lady refused you in order to marry your clerk.'""Not 'in order to----' You know I have assured you that under nocircumstances would I have married Mr. Bragg.""Yes, May; you have assured me so. But you are not yet nineteen; andI--alas!--was nineteen more than nineteen years ago. It struck me thatMr. Rivers was desirous that you should take your full share ofresponsibility in the matter. And he seemed a little anxious about hisplace. At all events he brought forward the salary he is earning withMr. Bragg as an important element in the financial budget with which hefavoured me. (How the man could think for a moment that your familywould consent!) I gathered that he was decidedly unwilling to lose it.""He only took it for my sake.""Ah! That was particularly kind of him. Well, it strikes me that hewould now like to keep it for his own. Of course I must write to yourfather. I presume you will admit that it is proper to inform him of thestate of the case?""You can write if you choose, Aunt Pauline. It will make no difference,_now_.""I think you will find it will make a considerable difference!Circumstances have entirely altered your father's position in the world.You will be daughter and heiress to a peer of the realm."There was a long pause. May stood with one foot on the fender before abright fire in her aunt's dressing-room, her elbow on the mantel-shelf,and her cheek resting in her hand.Then Mrs. Dormer-Smith resumed softly, "Perhaps I deceive myself--thewish may be father to the thought--but I confess I got the impressionthat it might not be hopeless to induce Mr. Rivers to withdraw,voluntarily, from his false position. Of course he could do no less thanstand to it so long as you appeared resolved to stand to it; but----Ihope and trust, May, that if it should be as I think, you would notinsist on being obstinate?""You know, as well as I know it myself, Aunt Pauline, that I would diesooner than hold him bound for one instant, unless----But I won't answeryou as if I took your words seriously."Upon that she managed to walk out of the room with dignity and dry eyes.But the poor child, for all her brave words, did take her aunt's hint soseriously as to throw herself on the bed in her own room, and liesobbing there for an hour.To her husband, Mrs. Dormer-Smith had reported the interview with Owenas accurately as she could. She did, indeed, declare her belief that theyoung man was a Nihilist. But that was said genuinely enough. A man ofgentle birth, who deliberately stated--apparently with sympatheticapproval--that there were mechanics who would be ashamed to own CaptainCheffington as a father-in-law, was, in her opinion, evidently preparedto demolish the existing bases of human society.Mr. Dormer-Smith was very sorry for his niece: more sorry than hethought it necessary to express at that moment to Pauline. But still heagreed with his wife that every effort ought to be made to prevent hermarrying so disastrously. It might have been supposed, perhaps, that Mr.Dormer-Smith, not having found his own mode of life productive ofunalloyed felicity, in spite of a fair income, aristocratic connections,and a wife devoted to keeping up their position in society, would havebeen not unwilling to let May try her fate in a different fashion. Butit is a common experience that, although the possession of certainthings gives them not the smallest gleam of happiness, yet, to a largeclass of minds, the thought of doing without these things suggestsmisery. The unusual is a terrible scarecrow, and keeps many weak-mindedbirds from the cherries.Mr. Dormer-Smith was to go down to Combe Park to attend the funeral ofhis deceased cousin-in-law. He had some liking for Lucius, and thought,as he sat in the railway carriage speeding down to the little waysidestation beyond Oldchester, where he was to alight, that it was a trulyinscrutable dispensation which took away Lucius--a man at leastharmless, and of honourable principles--and left Augustus alive; and hecould not help regretting the death of Lucius on May's account. Luciushad been, in his dry, peculiar manner, very kind towards his youngcousin. He had resented her father's neglect of her; and he treated her,when they met, with a certain air of protection, and almost tenderness,such as one might assume towards a child or an animal that one knew tohave been hardly used. Frederick thought it not impossible that, hadLucius lived, his influence might have been brought to bear on May forher good. But Lucius was gone; and Augustus remained to disgrace thefamily and annoy his relations more than ever.This, however, was not Pauline's idea. Although her brother's secondmarriage had, apparently, receded into the background, in consequence ofthese new troubles about May, yet it had really been occupying many ofMrs. Dormer-Smith's thoughts. She certainly considered it to be not_quite_ so terrible a business now that Lucius--poor dear Lucius!--wasout of the way, as it would have been had he lived. A ViscountessCastlecombe might be floated, Pauline said to herself, where a Mrs.Augustus Cheffington would stick in the mud. They could live chieflyabroad--not, of course, in a shabby street in Brussels; but on theRiviera, for instance. A warm climate had always suited Augustus. And asfor herself, she, Pauline, would never willingly pass an hour in Englandbetween the first of November and the last of April. It really would notbe at all disagreeable to spend one or two of the winter months withone's brother and sister-in-law--thank Heaven that, at least, she wasnot English! So many deviations from "good form" might be got over onthe plea of foreign manners--at some charming, sunny place, say St.Raphael! That was not so far from Nice as to preclude the enjoyment ofsome little gaiety and society. They would have a villa of their own, ofcourse. Perhaps, Augustus might build himself one. That sort of lifewould enable them to catch a good many travellers on the wing. And, withsufficient tact and _savoir faire_ (which Pauline flattered herself shecould supply), it might be possible to fill their house with asuccession of "nice" people. The "nicest" people were sometimes ratherless exigent on the other side of the Channel! At any rate, there wouldbe less difficulty in "floating" Lady Castlecombe on the stream ofsociety abroad than at home. Augustus would be rich; Uncle George couldnot prevent that, let him do what he would with his savings and hisinvestments. For the estates were strictly entailed; and Uncle Georgehad nursed them into something like treble their value when he succeededto the property. Mrs. Griffin heard from Lady Mary, the Dean ofOldchester's wife, who had it from the Rector of Combe, that LordCastlecombe was crushed by the loss of Lucius. Augustus might not haveto wait very long for his inheritance. How strangely things turn out!Well, she would write very kindly and gently to her brother. There wasthe excuse of addressing him about May; and she would take theopportunity of sending a civil word to his wife. It must be donedelicately, of course. But Augustus should see that there was nodisposition to be hostile, on the part of his sister, at any rate.It was in the forenoon of the day after Owen's visit that Mrs.Dormer-Smith was thus meditating. Her husband had started for CombePark. The house was very quiet; the fire in her dressing-room was verywarm; several budgets of gossip had arrived by the post from variouscountry houses, and lay unopened within reach of her hand. Mrs.Dormer-Smith felt that there was a certain "luxury of woe" in a familyaffliction which justified one in saying "not at home," and sitting in awadded dressing-gown, without causing one either heart-ache or anxiety.And she had been softly rocking herself in the day-dreams recordedabove, when they were interrupted as suddenly, if not as fatally, asthose of La Fontaine's milkmaid. James stood before her with a visitingcard on a salver, and a cloud of depression--which was the utmostrevelation of ill-humour his well-trained visage ever allowed itself,above-stairs--on his shaven countenance."What is this, James? What do you mean by bringing me cards here--andnow?""I _said_ 'not at home,' ma'am, but the--the party didn't seem tounderstand; and, unfortunately, Miss Cheffington happening to passthrough the hall at that moment----""Who is it? Where is the person?"Mrs. Dormer-Smith took the card and examined it through her eyeglasswith a sinking heart. Could that subversive young man have returned? Orwas there, perchance, some other suitor in the field? An anarchicalshoemaker, possibly! Pauline's confidence in Mrs. Dobbs had beencompletely blown into the air by learning that she had approved andencouraged May's engagement to a young man who calmly avowed that hepossessed one hundred and fifty pounds a year of his own; and shefelt that any dreadful revelation might be made at any moment. Butthe name on the card was not a masculine one, at any rate. Mrs.Something-or-other Simpson, she read on it."Is the--lady with Miss Cheffington now, James?""Yes, ma'am. Miss Cheffington took her into the dining-room. I thoughtthat, as last time--I mean as Smithson wasn't in the way--I'd better letyou know, ma'am.""Did the lady ask for me?""N-no; I--well, I really hardly know, ma'am.""You hardly know?""Well, ma'am, she talked a great deal, and so--so----It was uncommonlydifficult to follow what she said. At first I thought she announced hername as being Oldchester. I _did_ say 'not at home' twice, but it was nouse; and then Miss Cheffington happening to pass through the hall----""That will do."James retired with an injured air, and Mrs. Dormer-Smith was left toconsider within herself whether duty required her to be present at theinterview between May and this unknown Mrs. Simpson, or whether shemight indulge herself by sitting still and reading Mrs. Griffin's lastletter in comfort and quietude. After a brief deliberation, she resolvedto go downstairs. There was no knowing who or what the woman might be.James had said something about Oldchester. No doubt she came from thatplace. Perhaps she was an emissary of Mr. Rivers! Pauline, as she roseand drew a shawl round her shoulders, before facing the chillieratmosphere of the staircase, breathed a pious hope that her brotherAugustus might sooner or later compensate her for all the sacrifices shewas making on behalf of May.Before she reached the dining-room, she heard the sound of a fluentmonologue. May was not speaking at all, so far as Mrs. Dormer-Smithcould make out. When she entered the room, she found the girl sittingbeside a stout, florid woman, dressed in _trente-six couleurs_--asPauline phrased it to herself--who was holding forth with a profusion of"nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles."Mrs. Dormer-Smith made this stranger a bow of such freezing politenessas ought to have petrified her on the spot; and, turning to May,inquired with raised eyebrows, "Who is your friend, May?"But Amelia Simpson had not the least suspicion that she was beingsnubbed in the most superior style known to modern science. She rose,with her usual impulsive vehemence, from her chair, and said smilingly--"Mrs. Dormer-Smith? I thought so! Permit me to apologize for a seemingbreach of etiquette. I am well aware that my call ought properly to havebeen paid to _you_, the mistress of this elegant mansion; but, being_personally_ unknown--although we are not so 'remote, unfriended,melancholy, or slow'--not that I use the epithet in a slang sense, Iassure you!--in Oldchester, as to be unaware that Mrs. Dormer-Smith, theaccomplished relative of our dear Miranda, is in all respects 'a glassof fashion and a mould of form.' Only I wish our divine bard had chosenany other word than 'mould,' which somehow is inextricably connected inmy mind with short sixes.""Oh!" ejaculated Pauline, in a faint voice, as she sank into a chair;and she remained gazing at the visitor with a helpless air.At another time, May would have had a keen and enjoying sense of thecomic elements in this little scene; but although she saw them now asdistinctly as she ever could have done, she was too unhappy to enjoythem. She said quietly--"This is Mrs. Simpson, Aunt Pauline. Her husband is professor of musicat Oldchester; and they are both very old friends of dear Granny."Now, Pauline was not prepared to break altogether with Mrs. Dobbs. Mrs.Dobbs had behaved very badly in that matter of young Rivers; butsomething must be excused to ignorance; and her allowance for Maycontinued to be paid up every quarter with exemplary punctuality. Letmatters turn out as well as possible, there must still be a "meantime"during which Mrs. Dobbs's money would be valuable--and, indeed,indispensable--if May were to remain under her aunt's roof. It occurredto Pauline to invite this incredibly attired person to share Cecile'searly dinner in the housekeeper's room, and then to withdraw herself andMay on the plea of some imaginary engagement. She was just about tocarry out this idea when the reiteration of a name in Mrs. Simpson'srapid talk struck her ear, and excited her curiosity: "Mrs. Bransby."Amelia was talking volubly to May about Mrs. Bransby. She had resumedwhat she was pleased to call her "conversation" with May, having madesome sort of incoherent apology to Mrs. Dormer-Smith, to the effect thatshe had a very short time to remain, and "so many interesting topics ofmutual interest to discuss."She rambled on about her last evening's visit to Collingwood Terrace.Mr. Rivers and dear Mrs. Bransby would make a charming couple; and as tothe difference in years--what did years signify? And the difference wasnot so great, after all. Mr. Rivers was very steady and staid for hisage; and Mrs. Bransby looked so wonderfully youthful!--not a line in herforehead, in spite of all her troubles. And then Mr. Bragg's friendshipand countenance would be so valuable! He evidently approved it all. Andif he gave Mr. Rivers a share in his business--"even a comparativelysmall share," said Amelia, feeling that she was keeping well within thelimits of probability, and even displaying a certain business-likesobriety of conjecture--considering how colossal an affair _that_ was,everything would be made smooth for them. Mrs. Bransby's childrenevidently adored Mr. Rivers--which was _so_ delightful! And as for Mr.Rivers's devotion to Mrs. Bransby, no one could doubt that who saw themtogether. (This was said rather to a shadowy audience of Oldchesterpersons, who had declared that, however ridiculous Mrs. Bransby mightmake herself, young Rivers was not likely to tie himself for life to amiddle-aged woman with a family, than to Amelia's present hearers.) Andafter all the unkind things which had been reported in Oldchester, itwould be a heartfelt joy to Mrs. Bransby's friends to see her widowhoodso happily brought to a close."What unkind things have been reported in Oldchester? What do you mean?"asked May. She spoke eagerly, but quite firmly. There was no tremor inher voice, no rising of unbidden tears to her eyes. Her whole heart andsoul were concentrated on getting at the truth.Amelia pulled herself up a little. She had been running on rather tooheedlessly. Some things had latterly been said of Mrs. Bransby whichcould scarcely be repeated with propriety to a young lady--at least,according to Amelia's code of what was proper."Oh, my dear Miranda," she stammered, "the world is ever censorious; butas the lyric bard so beautifully puts it--    'I'd weep when friends deceive me,    If _thou_ wert like them, untrue.'Although why it is taken for granted that friends--in any true sense ofthe word--should be expected to deceive, I must leave to meta-physics todetermine!"Mrs. Dormer-Smith here put in her word. "Oh, we had already heard ofthese scandals," she said. "My niece was inclined to doubt theirexistence, I believe. I hope you are convinced now, May!""Really!" exclaimed Mrs. Simpson, glancing with growing uneasiness fromMay to her aunt. Something, she perceived, was wrong--but what?"Dear Mrs. Simpson," said May, "I am very sure that whoever else wasunkind and scandalous, you were not.""Ever the same sweet nature!" murmured Amelia; "but, perhaps, it was notso much that people were unkind, not exactly unkind, but mistaken. Yousee, when a person tells you a thing, positively, there is a certainunkindness in not believing it! And yet, on the other hand, one wouldnot willingly accept evil reports of a fellow-creature. There is adifficulty in harmoniously blending the two horns of this dilemma--if Imay be allowed to say so--which, to some extent, excuses error."The good lady's habitual confusion of ideas was increased by the nervousfear that she had said something unfortunate. She brought her visit toan end earlier than she otherwise might have done; and in takingeffusive leave of May she whispered--"I trust I did not commit any solecism against the code of manners whichbelongs to the _elite_ of the _haut ton_, in alluding to our fairfriend, Mrs. B----?""No, no," answered May gently; "don't vex yourself by thinking so."Mrs. Simpson brightened up a little, and asked aloud, "And what messageshall I give to grandmamma?"May scarcely recognized "Granny" under this appellation, adopted inhonour of Mrs. Dormer-Smith's social distinction. But after an instantshe said--"Oh, give her my dear love; I shall write to her to-morrow. And, please,my love to Uncle Jo.""Ah, I recognize our dear Miranda's affectionate constancy there!" criedAmelia. "Mr. Weatherhead will be much gratified.""Gratified! I think he would have a right to be disgusted if I forgothim! Dear, good, honest, kind-hearted Uncle Jo!""_Who_ is this person?" demanded Pauline, genuinely aghast at the ideathat some hitherto unknown brother of Susan Dobbs was in existence. Theone extenuating circumstance in that unfortunate marriage had alwaysappeared to her to be the fact that Susan was an only child."He is a certain Mr. Joseph Weatherhead," answered May, with greatdistinctness. "He was originally a bookbinder's apprentice, and then aprinter and bookseller in a small way of business at Birmingham. He ismy grandmother's brother-in-law, and one of the best men in the world.He used to give me shillings when I went back to school; and once Iremember--that was just before my father left me on granny's hands--henoticed that my boots were disgracefully shabby, and took me out andbought me a new pair."Then Mrs. Simpson went away in a nervous flutter, and with the positive,though puzzled, conviction that there was something very wrong indeedbetween the aunt and niece.CHAPTER IX.Of course Mrs. Dormer-Smith availed herself to the utmost of Mrs.Simpson's revelations. They were most valuable. And they had the effectof confirming her own vague suspicions in an unexpected manner. Thatwhich had been merely "diplomatic" colouring in her presentment of thesituation to May, turned out to be real, solid, vulgar fact!The state of things was certainly very singular. But she did not doubtthat she had discovered the true explanation of it. Mr. Rivers hadprobably been infatuated with Mrs. Bransby before her husband's death.Such infatuations were by no means rare at their respective ages. Thelady had been willing to coquette after a sentimental fashion: which,also, was not unprecedented! There had probably been no seriousintention of evil-doing on either side. "At all events we can give themthe benefit of the doubt!" reflected Pauline charitably. Meanwhile, Mr.Rivers had met with May. He had been thrown a great deal into hersociety, had been encouraged by her stupid old grandmother, had thoughther connections and prospects desirable, and had probably admiredherself a good deal. Pauline did not see why not. It was very possiblefor a man to admire more than one woman at a time! Mr. Rivers makes loveto May, persuades her to enter into a clandestine engagement, and goesabroad. But then something unforeseen happens: _the husband dies_; andall the old feeling is revived. Mr. Rivers hastens back to England. Thewidow is pathetic--helpless--throws herself on his advice and support.He goes to live under her roof, and the mischief is done! A handsome,scheming woman, under these circumstances, might well be irresistible.As to him, of course he had behaved badly in a way. But, after all, onemust accept men as they are. And, as Pauline said to herself, the follyof young men in such matters, and their invincible tendency to sacrificethemselves to the wrong woman, are simply unfathomable! At any ratewhether her cousin's death had made Rivers more willing to fulfil hisengagement to May; or whether he would be glad of a pretext to breakwith her in order to marry Mrs. Bransby and her five children; May mustclearly perceive that _she_ could have nothing more to say to him.All these considerations, and the conclusion to which they led, Mrs.Dormer-Smith administered to her niece, in larger or smaller doses,during the remainder of the day. Sometimes it was by way of a few dropsat a time:--a hint, a word, perhaps merely a sigh, accompanied by anexpressive shrug of the shoulders. Sometimes it was a copious pouringforth of the evidence. Sometimes it was an appeal to May's pride:sometimes to her principles.The girl was worn out with fighting against shadows. And, though theymight be shadows, they were gathering darkly.The worst was that she was, in one sense, as solitary as though she hadbeen alone on a desert island. There was absolutely no communion ofspirit between her and her aunt on this subject. Had her uncle beenthere, she thought that even he would have understood her better. Shecould write, of course, to granny; and of course granny would answerher. But another whole long day must elapse before she could have thecomfort of granny's letter: even supposing it were sent without a post'sdelay. She could not see Owen. She was not sure, at moments, whether shewished to see him. And then again, with a sudden revulsion of feeling,she would long for his presence.She had in her pocket the note he had written on the previous evening,begging her to inform Mr. Bragg of their engagement. It had reached herhands only an hour or two before Amelia Simpson's visit; and was, asyet, unanswered. The note had been dashed off quickly, as we know. Andto May, disheartened and confused as she was already by her aunt'sversion of the interview with Owen, it seemed needlessly brief and dry.He begged May to tell Mr. Bragg of their engagement at once. Under thecircumstances he thought Mr. Bragg ought to know it, and theannouncement would come best from her. He had not had a moment in whichto speak of it during their hurried interview. But he did not doubt thatMay would feel as he felt on this point. She had better, if possible,send her communication so that Mr. Bragg should receive it that sameafternoon; since he certainly ought to know the truth soon, at any cost.These last words had reference to the possibility that the revelationmight affect the fortunes of the Bransby family. But May knew nothing ofthat; and they jarred on her. Why should Owen speak to her of the"cost"? It was almost like a boast that he was ready to sacrificehimself. In talking to Aunt Pauline he had shown that he was anxious notto lose his situation. For her sake? Oh yes; no doubt for her sake. Butthe words jarred on her. The lightest touch will jar upon a bruise.And then the loneliness of spirit was so trying! Solitude may sometimesbe a good counsellor for the brain. But it is rarely so for the heart.Nothing so strengthens our best impulses, faiths, and affections as tosee them reflected in the soul of a fellow-creature. To the youngespecially, want of sympathy with their emotions is like want ofdaylight to a flower. Those who have travelled half way along life'sjourney are apt to forget how much diffidence is often mingled with ayoung girl's acceptance of love. The gift seems so unspeakably great! Atrembling sense of unreality sometimes comes with the recognition of itspreciousness and beauty."Can it be? Am _I_ really loved so much? Dare I believe it?" Thesequestions are often asked by sensitive young hearts. Happiness begetshumility in the finer sort of nature.Elder spectators, looking on at the old, ever-new story, find it clearand simple enough. But to the actors it may seem complex and difficult.Lookers on, in any case, see but a small portion of the drama of ourlives. The intensest part of it--the most poignant tragedy, the sunniestcomedy--is played within ourselves by invisible forces. Truly, and indread earnest, "we are such stuff as dreams are made of."All the day May kept Owen's note in her pocket, and when evening came,she had neither answered it, nor written to Mr. Bragg. Owen was right,no doubt, in saying that Mr. Bragg ought to know the truth. But what_was_ the truth? In the whirlpool of her agitated thoughts sometimes oneanswer would float uppermost, and sometimes another. Could her aunt beright in saying that she would prejudice Owen's future by holding him tohis word? Holding him! But it was rather for Owen to hold her. He couldnot suspect that his claim would be disallowed. He, at least, had noreason to doubt the completeness of her love for him. And then a scarletblush would burn her cheeks, and hot tears would be forced from hereyes, by a thought which touched her maiden pride to the quick:--was henot leaving it to her to claim him? If she wrote that letter to Mr.Bragg, she would, in fact, be claiming him.She had told Mr. Bragg, she remembered, when he asked her if her familyapproved of the man she had promised to marry, that she, at any rate,was proud to be loved by him. Yes; but too proud to accept a love thatwas not eagerly given. Oh, it was all weariness, and bitterness, andperturbation of spirit!Sometimes, for a moment, the recollection of Owen's look and Owen'swords would pierce the clouds like a ray of sunshine, and her heartwould cry out, "Why am I troubled and tormented by lies and foolishness?Owen is loyal, tender, and true--the soul of truth and honour! I needonly trust to him, and all will be well." But then Aunt Pauline wouldrepeat some of poor Amelia Simpson's glowing words about "the charmingcouple" in Collingwood Terrace--made all the more impressive by the factthat Aunt Pauline really believed them; and the fog would gather again,and she would ask herself, "How if he should be loyal against hisinclination?"In the evening she said to her aunt, "Aunt Pauline, I will go away fromLondon; I will go to Granny. I could not, in any case, continue to takeher money for keeping me here. I will go down to Oldchester; that willbe best. And Owen and I can arrange afterwards what we will do." For notby a word would she betray a doubt of Owen. To her aunt she upheld hisfaithfulness unwaveringly; she upheld it, indeed, in her own heart,chiding down her doubts as one chides down a snarling dog. But thoughshe could chide, she could not remove them; they were there, crouching.She was conscious of their existence, as pain is felt in a dream.But it did not at all suit Mrs. Dormer-Smith's views that her nieceshould go away in that fashion. "I cannot let you leave my house, May,"she said; "I am responsible for you to your father."Then May rebelled. She declared that Granny had been father and motherand friend to her, and that she did not feel she owed any filial dutyexcept to Granny.Pauline privately thought that she recognized the influence of Mr.Rivers in this speech. She put her handkerchief to her eyes, andobserved plaintively that she was sorry May had no touch of affectionfor _her_ or for her uncle, who had striven to treat her as their ownchild. She was genuinely hurt, and thought she had reason to complain ofthe girl's ingratitude. May recognized that her aunt was sincere inthis. She, too, felt that Aunt Pauline had meant to do well for her,although it had all turned out amiss. She thought of the day of herfirst arrival in town, of her aunt's affectionate reception of her, andgentle sweetness ever since, until these last unhappy days. Her thoughtswent back farther--to the time when the dowager was alive, and her auntused to see her in the dreary old house at Richmond, and mourn over herclothes, and kiss her kindly when she went away.With a sudden impulse she knelt down beside Mrs. Dormer-Smith's chair,and put her arms round her."Aunt Pauline," she said, "I know you have meant to be kind. You _have_been kind. No doubt I have given you trouble and anxiety; partly,perhaps, by my fault, but more by my misfortune. I am not insensible ofall that. But, dear Aunt Pauline, I want you to believe--do, pray,believe--that it would be cruel to separate me from Owen. Nothing_shall_ part us, except his own will," she added in a low voice. Then,after an instant, she went on, pressing her soft young face against heraunt's shoulder, "Perhaps you think I don't care so very deeply for him?Of course you cannot know; you have never seen us together; it has allcome upon you quite suddenly. But, indeed, indeed, if I had to give himup, I think it would break my heart. Oh, dear Aunt Pauline, do be kindto us, and help us! I have no mother. And I--I love him so!"Pauline folded the sobbing girl in her arms. Perhaps she had never feltthe great duty she owed to society so hard of fulfilment as at thatmoment. It was really frightful to think of the havoc wrought by theselfish recklessness of that Nihilist with his hundred and fifty poundsa year! The recollection of the cold-blooded effrontery with which hehad mentioned the sum made her shudder.For a little time she held her niece silently in a motherly embrace.Then she said softly, "This is very sad and distressing, dear May." Andher own eyes were full of tears. "However much I may disapprove"--(theclinging arms around her shoulders relaxed their hold a little here; butshe gently pressed the girl close to her again)--"and--and deplore thestate of the case, it is most painful to me to see you suffer. But wemust not allow feeling to override all considerations of what is rightand proper. We must not forget that we have duties--duties towardssociety."May quietly removed one arm from her aunt's neck, and began to dry hereyes."I don't say that those duties are easy. Those who have no position inthe world to keep up may be enviable in some respects. I'm sure I amoften tempted to envy the people one sees riding in omnibuses," saidPauline, with what she felt to be a bold but forcible hyperbole. "But_noblesse oblige_. You and I are both born Cheffingtons. It may be allvery well for the _bourgeoisie_ to indulge in sentiment, andsweet-hearts, and that sort of thing; but from us society expectssomething different. There are certain opportunities which, it appearsto me, it is absolutely flying in the face of Providence to neglect. Iknow perfectly well that if the Hautenvilles had the slightest inklingof an idea that you had refused Mr. Bragg, Felicia would come flyingback from Rome like a whirlwind. However, I will not dwell on that now.You are dreadfully worn out, my poor child, and your eyes will not befit to be seen for a week. Rose-water the last thing before going tobed. There is nothing so soothing. Poor child! I _must_ steel myself todo my duty, May; but it really is excessively trying. Go to rest now,dear, and sleep off your agitation. To-morrow we will talk more calmly."May had gently withdrawn herself from her aunt's embrace, and had risenfrom her knees. "To-morrow I will go to Granny," she said quietly."Ah, no, dearest! that cannot be. It is out of the question. But you maywrite to Mrs. Dobbs and hear what she says."Pauline had resolved to write herself to Mrs. Dobbs, detailing all sheknew (and a great deal more which she thought she knew) about Mr.Rivers's conduct, and setting forth the change in May's position as thedaughter of the future Lord Castlecombe. Things were very different fromwhat they had been three or four months ago. Even Mrs. Dobbs--althoughshe had turned out so disappointingly foolish as to this preposterouslove affair--must see that."Good night, dear child; you will get over this distress; and you willacknowledge hereafter, I am quite confident, that you have had a goodescape. As to that odious woman, _she_ is sure to be miserable, whetherhe marries her or not, that's one comfort!" said Aunt Pauline.The sight of May's tearful white face exacerbated her virtuousindignation against Mrs. Bransby; nor was this feeling in the slightestdegree mitigated by her strong desire that Mrs. Bransby should marryyoung Rivers, and take him out of their way for ever."Good night, Aunt Pauline," answered May, bending down, and slightlytouching her aunt's forehead with her lips.Pauline embraced the girl tenderly. "Poor darling!" she murmured. "Don'tforget the rose-water."CHAPTER X.When May went up to her room, she neglected her aunt's advice as to therose-water. She sat down beside the fire, and tried to think of what shehad best do.Help from her aunt was clearly not to be hoped for. She did not feelanger against Aunt Pauline at that moment. She had felt it some timebefore, but not now. Would it not be like feeling angry with a Chinesefor not comprehending English? They simply did not understand oneanother. There was a barrier between their minds--at least, on the onesubject which May had at heart--which, as it seemed, neither of themcould pass or penetrate.She would go to Granny! There she would find love and sympathy, and thesheltering mother-wings she yearned for. And, at the bottom of herheart, there was the half-unconscious feeling that Granny would be astaunch partisan of Owen's, and would be able to justify her trust inhim.But then Aunt Pauline had refused to let her go, and had said she mightwrite. Write! and lose time, and probably fail to convince Granny of thesick longing, the positive _need_ she felt to get away from London.There would be correspondence and discussion, and then her uncle wouldcome back, and there would be more discussion, and she could not seeOwen. If she wrote to him and he came, he would not be admitted to thehouse; and she could not go to him.Well, then, she would run away. There was nothing for it but to run awayto Granny, and she made up her mind to do so. Nothing should preventher. Nothing! She started up and took her purse out of a drawer. She wasbut slenderly provided with pocket-money, the bulk of her allowance fromMrs. Dobbs being administered by Aunt Pauline. She counted out thecontents of the little smart _porte-monnaie_ with deep anxiety. Therewas half a sovereign and some silver. Only fifteen shillings! That wouldnot suffice to carry her to Oldchester--and then she must have a cab.She could not find her way to the station on foot: and, besides, itwould take such a long time! How much time she did not know exactly; butshe remembered that it had seemed a rather long drive from the terminusto Kensington. And even if she could walk the distance, she would notknow at what hour to set out in order to catch the express train, whichwould bring her into Oldchester a little after five o'clock the sameevening.A little thrill ran through her veins as she pictured herself arrivingat Jessamine Cottage in one of the station flys, looking from thevehicle at the cheerful firelight which would surely be shining from theparlour window at that hour. And then Martha would come to the door, andnot recognize her at first in the darkness; and Granny would cry out insurprise at the sound of her voice; and then there would be the dearmotherly arms round her, the dear motherly breast to lay her troubledhead upon, the blessed sense of rest, and trust, and comfort!Feverishly May counted and re-counted her money. The fifteen shillingsremained inexorably fifteen, and no more. All sorts of schemes passedthrough her mind. Cecile might perhaps lend her some money--or Smithson!But to ask for a loan from either of them would excite too much wonderand suspicion; it would at once be reported to her aunt.Suddenly there darted into her mind the recollection that Harold hadsome money. Uncle Frederick had given the child half a sovereign on hisbirthday, a day or two ago. That was an inspiration! She would askHarold to lend her the money, and to keep the secret until she should begone. She knew that she could trust him; the child was staunch, andwould be proud of being confided in. Poor little Harold! She rememberedthat it was he who had told her of Owen's presence in the house on thatday--when was it? _Yesterday?_ Impossible! It was weeks--months ago,surely! A large part of her life seemed to have passed since then.May lay down to rest, tired out with the various emotions of the day,but with her brain so beleaguered by shifting thoughts and images thatshe was certain she should not be able to sleep. But she might at leastrest her body, which felt bruised and weary, as though she had beenwalking with a heavy burthen all day long. She dropped off to sleep,nevertheless, almost immediately, but soon awoke again with a start anda sensation of falling swiftly, and a vague terror. But at length,towards morning, she did sleep continuously and heavily; and when shenext awoke her watch, and a dull yellowish glimmer through thewindow-blind, told her it was day.It was a dismal London morning, wet and cold. The wind was howling amongthe chimney-pots, and sending down showers of soot and smoke, mingledwith sleet. It was the day appointed for the funeral of LuciusCheffington. Mr. Dormer-Smith was not expected home that night; thetrains did not fit conveniently. It had therefore been arranged that heshould stay at Combe Park until the following morning. Her uncle'sabsence made her opportunity, May thought. The train she wished totravel by started from London, she believed, at about two o'clock; butshe resolved to be at the terminus much earlier. The departure might beat some minutes before two; it would be too dreadful to miss the train!She felt an irrational hurry and eagerness to be gone, as if eachminute's delay might be fatal. She knew the feeling was groundless, butit mastered her.Preparations she had none to make, except clothing herself in a warmgown, and putting a few toilet necessaries into a little handbag. Mrs.Dormer-Smith always breakfasted late, and, during the cold weather, inher own room; and May shared the morning meal with her uncle. To-day, ather request, Harold and Wilfred were allowed to come downstairs andbreakfast with her. This arrangement suited Cecile, who much preferredbreakfasting with Smithson in the housekeeper's room to cuttingbread-and-butter and pouring out milk-and-water in the nursery.As soon as the meal was over, May asked Harold for the loan of hisgolden half-sovereign. His first reply was a severe blow. "You mean thatyellow sixpence papa gave me? I haven't got it, Cousin May."May felt as though the child had struck her. But the next moment headded--"Papa put it into that little box with a slit in it. You can't get itout. Nobody can get it out. It belongs to me, you know; only I can't buyanything with it. Papa says it's proper--property."May coaxed him to bring the box to her room, and found that it wasclosed by a little cheap lock, which it would be perfectly easy to forceopen. When she proposed this strong measure to Harold, he demurred atfirst; but finally yielded, on his cousin's saying that she wanted themoney very much, and would be unhappy if she could not get it. Aglove-box lined with quilted satin was offered him by way of immediatecompensation; and he was promised that his yellow sixpence should berepaid with ample interest in the shape of coin which would not sharethe inconvenient dignity of being "property," but might be freely spent.May felt as if she were a criminal as she wrenched open the littlemoney-box, and took out the half-sovereign, which lay glistening amid asmall heap of pennies and sixpences. Harold stood watching her intently."You do look funny, Cousin May!" he said. "Your cheeks are quite white,and your eyes are queer, and your hand burns. Mine is ever so cold.Feel!" He put his little red, cold hand on May's forehead, and the touchseemed deliciously refreshing to her."My head aches a little, Harold. I shall soon be well, though. I amgoing to see my dear granny. I have often told you about her. She is sogood and kind! She makes people well when they are sick or sorry."Harold's experience of being made well when he was sick was not of sucha nature as to make this praise particularly attractive to him."I s'pose she gives you powders?" he said, in a disparaging tone, andthen added gloomily, "I wouldn't go to her, if I was you."May kissed him, and assured him that Granny's methods were all pleasantones.Wilfred--who had been kept outside the room during the financialtransaction, as being too young to be trusted with a secret of suchimportance--was now admitted in compliance with his reiterated petition;and the two little fellows stood quietly watching their cousin, as in ahurried, feverish way, she put a few articles into her little bag, andtook a fur-lined cloak out of the wardrobe, and laid her hat and glovesready on the bed."I say, Cousin May," said Harold, all at once, "you'll come back again,sha'n't you?"She looked down at the child's upturned face, with a start. It had notoccurred to her before, but the thought now struck her that it was verylikely she should never return to that house."I will see _you_ again, darlings, if I live," she said, bending down tokiss and embrace the children.Wilfred, always inclined to be tearful, showed symptoms of setting up asympathetic wail. But Harold said, with a dogged little setting of thelips--"Well, if you don't come back, I know what I shall do. I've got allthose pennies left in the box, and I shall buy a stick and a bundle, andrun away, and go along the high road ever so far, till I find you.""I shall come too," cried Wilfred. "Papa gave _me_ sixpence!"All three looked, indeed, almost equally childish and innocent: Haroldand Wilfred, with their project of running away, derived from a nurserystory-book, and May clutching the "yellow sixpence" as a talisman thatwas to carry her afar from all trouble and persecution!She did not, of course, mean to leave Aunt Pauline in any anxiety as towhat had become of her; but she wanted to get a good start. After somedeliberation, she wrote a short note to her aunt, and entrusted it toHarold. His instructions were to keep it until luncheon-time, and thengive it to his mother. But, in case he heard them asking for May in thehouse, and wondering where she was, he might deliver it sooner. In anycase, he must not give it to Cecile or Smithson, but place it in hismother's own hand. This latter was a service which Harold felt to be asevere one; but he undertook it, with a feeling akin to that of a knightdoing battle with giants and dragons, on behalf of his liege lady. Notthat his mother would be harsh or cruel; that was quite out of thequestion. She would not even scold him much, probably; but she wouldlook at him with that complaining air of disapproval, as if he were anunmerited affliction, and call him and his brother "those dreadfullittle boys," and send him away to the nursery, all which things thechild felt keenly in his heart, although he was entirely unable toanalyze them in his brain.May also wrote to Owen, telling him of her departure, and confessingthat she had not written to Mr. Bragg."What is the use of my remaining in London, when we cannot meet?" shewrote. "We are as far apart, really, as when you were in Spain. I amworn out, dear Owen, and feel that I need Granny's help. Do not be angrywith me for taking this step without consulting you. You will know I amsafe and well-cared for with Granny, who is your friend, instead ofhaving to fight against the arguments of those who are hostile to you."Then, in a postscript, she added, "Mrs. Simpson came here yesterday. Shesaid she had seen you. You did not send me any message by her. Perhapsyou did not know she meant to see me?" This note she put in her pocketto be posted at the station.It was now past twelve o'clock; for early hours were not kept in theDormer-Smith household. May's nervous impatience to be gone was nolonger to be resisted. She took the children into the little back roomwhere she had been accustomed to give them their lessons, and on her ownresponsibility gave them a book full of coloured pictures which Cecilenever entrusted to their mischievous little fingers without her personalsupervision. And this unusual indulgence delighted them and absorbedtheir attention. Then she stole back to her own chamber, and looked outof the window. The rain was still falling at intervals in drivingshowers. All the better! There was the less chance of any one whom sheknew in that neighbourhood being abroad to recognize her.She had told Smithson immediately after breakfast that she was going toher own room, and did not wish to be disturbed until luncheon-time. Shenow put on her hat and gloves, wrapped herself in the warm cloak, andcarrying a tiny umbrella, which looked very unequal to offering muchresistance to the wind and rain that were now sweeping along the street,she crept downstairs and let herself out at the hall door.She had to walk some distance before reaching a cabstand, and by thetime she did so her feet were wet. She had no boots fitted to keep outmud and damp. Aunt Pauline considered thick boots superfluous in London.In the country, of course, it was quite "the right thing" to tramp aboutin all weathers, and proper _chaussures_ must be provided for thepurpose. Although, had it been a dogma laid down by "the best people"that one ought to march barefoot through the mire, Aunt Pauline wouldhave desired May to conform to that as well as to all other sacredordinances of the social creed.May was driven to the railway station in due course by a cabman who, onbeing asked what she had to pay, contented himself with only twice hisfare. She found she was much too early for the express train. But therewas a slow train going within half an hour. It would not reachOldchester until after the express, although starting before it; but Maydecided to travel by it. She was frightened at the idea of remaining inthe big terminus, where she might be seen and recognized by some passingacquaintance at any moment. And the idea of being actually on the roadto granny, safely shut up in a railway carriage out of reach, wastempting. She took her ticket, the purchase of which reduced herfunds to the last shilling, and was put into a carriage byherself--first-class passengers by that train not being numerous.The girl's head was throbbing, and the damp chill to her feet made hershiver. She leaned back in a corner of the carriage, and closed hereyes. The train trundled along, its progress arrested by frequentstoppages. The dim daylight faded. At wayside stations the reflectionsfrom the lamps shone with a melancholy gleam in inky pools ofrain-water. May began to suffer from want of food. She was not hungry;but she felt the need, although not the desire, for some sustenance. Atone place where they stopped a quarter of an hour, she thought ofgetting some tea; but there was a crowd of men in front of a counterwhere beer and spirits were being sold, but where she saw no tea; andthe steam from damp great coats, mingled with tobacco-smoke and closeair, made her feel sick. She tottered back to the carriage, carryingwith her a huge fossilized bun, which she tried, not very successfully,to nibble at intervals; and at length she fell into an uneasy doze.She was awakened by the opening of the carriage-door, and a voicesaying, "You'll be all right here, sir." A dark lantern flashed in hereyes. A hat-box and dressing-bag were put into the carriage by anobsequious porter. A gentleman entered and took his seat in the cornerfarthest away from her. The door was slammed to, and they moved onagain.May put up her hand to her forehead in a dazed manner. She feltconfused, and could not, for the moment, understand where she was. Herhead ached and throbbed painfully. Then she recollected it all, andwondered what o'clock it was, and whether they were drawing nearOldchester."Can you tell me what station that was?" she asked in a faint voice, ofher fellow-traveller.The gentleman turned his head sharply, and peered at her where she satin the darkness of her corner-seat. He could not distinguish her face;for, before his entrance, she had drawn the movable shade half acrossthe lamp in the roof of the carriage. Thinking he had not heard, or hadnot understood her, she repeated the question--"What is the name of that last station, if you please?"Upon which the gentleman, instead of making any such reply as might havebeen expected, exclaimed, "Lord bless my soul!" and leaving his place atthe other extremity of the carriage, he came and seated himself oppositeto her. "It _is_ Miss Cheffington!" he said, in a tone of the utmostwonder. And then May recognized Mr. Bragg."My dear young lady, how come you to be travelling alone--by this train?Is anything the matter?"His tone was so sincere and earnest, his face and manner so gentle andfatherly, that May at once felt she could trust him fully andfearlessly."I am so glad it's you, Mr. Bragg, and not a stranger!" she said,putting her hand out to take his."Thank you," said Mr. Bragg simply. "I'm glad it _is_ me, if I can be ofany use to you." Then he asked again, "Is anything the matter?""N--no; nothing very serious. I have run away from Aunt Pauline----""Run away!""And I'm going to Granny. You won't feel it your duty to give me up as afugitive from justice, will you?" she said, trying to smile, with verytremulous lips."Mrs. Dormer-Smith has never been treating you bad or cruel?" said Mr.Bragg wonderingly. "No, no; she _couldn't_.""No, truly, she could not be consciously cruel to me, or to any one; butshe has ideas which--she tried to persuade me----We don't understand oneanother, that's the truth."Mr. Bragg all at once remembered a certain private note despatched tohis hotel in town by Mrs. Dormer-Smith, wherein she had assured him thatMay was an inexperienced child, who didn't know her own mind, and beggedhim not to take her too absolutely at her word. He had never replied tothat note, having, indeed, nothing to say which it would be agreeable tohis correspondent to hear. But he recalled other instances in whichladies of the highest gentility had hunted him (or, rather, not_him_--he had no illusions of vanity on that point--but his largefortune) with a ruthless unscrupulosity which had amazed him, and agallant perseverance in the teeth of discouragement which almostextorted admiration. And the question stole into his mind, "Could Mrs.Dormer-Smith have been persecuting May on _his_ account?" The idea wasinexpressibly painful to him. But, anyway, he was relieved and thankfulto find that the girl did not shrink from him, but was sweet andgracious as ever."Well, to be sure," he said in his slow, pondering way, "'tis a strangechance that we should meet just now, isn't it? For I've just come fromyour family place, you know.""From where?""From the home of your ancestors, as Mr. Theodore Bransby calls it. Youasked me the name of that station I got in at. Well, it's Combe St.Mildred's, the station for Combe Park you know.""Is it? Then we cannot be far from Oldchester.""Not very far in miles; but this is an uncommon slow train--stopseverywhere. Stops just now at Wendhurst Junction; the express runsthrough. I'm afraid you're very tired, Miss Cheffington." He could notsee her at all distinctly, but her voice betrayed great weariness, hethought."Not very--yes, rather. It does not matter now; we shall soon be there.""Yes," went on Mr. Bragg, "I've been attending the funeral.""Oh yes. Poor Lucius! I had forgotten that it was for to-day," said May,with a self-reproachful feeling. "He was very kind to me, although, atfirst, he seemed so dry and eccentric. I think he liked me. I know Iliked him.""Yes; no doubt but what he liked you. _That_ can't be disputed. And itdoes him honour, in my opinion. I suppose I ought to congratulate you,Miss Cheffington--although congratulating may seem out of place with acrape band round your hat. And yet I don't know!""Congratulate me! Do you mean because my father is the heir? I thinkthere is more sorrow in Lord Castlecombe's heart than there can besatisfaction in any one else's?" answered May. She was surprised at thismanifestation of coarseness of feeling in Mr. Bragg. It was the firstshe had ever observed in him."Your father? Lord bless me, no! Nothing to do with your father. I wasalluding to your cousin's last will and testament. I was present when itwas read, by Lord Castlecombe's desire, although having no particularclaim that I know of. Still, when we came back from the old churchyard,his lordship invited me into the library, and the will was read out thenby Wagget, the lawyer, poor Martin Bransby's successor.""But what has all that to do with me?" asked May, sitting upright, andholding on by the elbows of the seat. As she did so, everything seemedto waver and swim before her eyes. The cushions on which she sat seemedto be sinking down through the earth. The long fast, her broken sleep onthe previous night, the tears she had shed, and all the emotions of thisjourney, which to her was an adventure fraught with all kinds ofanxieties, were telling upon her. But she made a desperate effort tolisten--not to be ill, not to give trouble. The train was to stopshortly. She would hold up her courage until then. Had not the gloomcaused by the lamp-shade baffled Mr. Bragg's observation, he would havebeen startled by her countenance.As it was, he merely answered, "Well, because your cousin has leftyou all the little property he inherited from his mother. It isn't agreat fortune--a matter of four hundred and fifty, or five hundredpound a year, as well as I can make out. But it's all in soundinvestments--mostly Government securities--and it's settled on you everypenny of it."But May, struggling against a sick sensation of faintness, was scarcelyable to grasp the meaning of what was said to her. Her eyes grew dim;she half-rose up from her seat, made a vague movement with her hands,such as one makes in falling and clutching at whatever is nearest, andthen sank down in a heap on the floor of the carriage, like a woundedbird. She was in a dead swoon, and her young face looked piteously whiteand wan under the crude glare of the gas, as the train moved slowly,with much resounding clangour, into the big station at WendhurstJunction.CHAPTER XI.With that indescribably dreadful rushing, whirling sensation in thebrain, which can never be forgotten by whoever has once experienced it,May Cheffington recovered out of her swoon, and her senses returned toher.She was lying on a cushioned seat in the ladies' waiting-room atWendhurst Junction. Her dress had been loosened, her own warm cloak hadbeen spread over her as a coverlet, a woollen shawl was thrown acrossher feet, and an elderly woman was sprinkling water on her forehead. Sheopened her eyes, and then shut them again lazily. The glare of the gasmade her blink, and the sense of rest was, for the moment, all shewanted."She'll do now," said the elderly woman, wiping May's wet forehead witha handkerchief. Then she went to the door of the room, and half openingit, said to some one outside, "Coming round beautiful, sir; she'll beall right now.""Who's there?" asked May, in a little feeble, drowsy voice."Your pa, dear. He _has_ been in a taking about you. But I'm telling himyou're as right as right can be. So you are, ain't you? There's apretty!"Every second that passed was bringing more clearness to May's mind, moreanimation to her frame. By the time the elderly woman had finishedspeaking, May said--"Oh, ask him to come in. Ask him, pray, to come here and speak to me!"This message being transmitted, the door was opened, and in walked Mr.Bragg, with a most disturbed and anxious countenance.May was lying with her head supported on a pillow formed of a great coathastily rolled up, which the attendant had covered with her own whiteapron. The pretty soft brown hair, dabbled here and there with water,was hanging in disorder. Her eyes looked very large and bright in herpale face. Mr. Bragg came and stood beside her, and looked at her with asort of tender, pitying trepidation: as an amiable giant mightcontemplate Ariel with a broken wing: longing to help, but fearing tohurt, the delicate creature.May put out her hand and took hold of Mr. Bragg's as innocently aslittle Enid might have done. "Oh, I am so sorry!" she said."Yes," returned Mr. Bragg, in a subdued voice. "And I'm so sorry, too.But you are feeling better now, ain't you?""Oh, but I mean I am sorry for _you_. Sorry to frighten you and to giveyou so much trouble.""Trouble! Well, I don't know about that. This good lady here has beentaking what trouble there was to take. Not such a vast deal, was it,ma'am?"The "good lady" who had begun to doubt the correctness of her assumptionthat these two were father and daughter, smoothed the shawl over May'sfeet, and murmured that they were not to mention it.Mr. Bragg pulled out his watch impatiently."What! haven't they found anybody yet?" he said. "I sent off a man in afly ten minutes ago."The attendant observed apologetically that the first doctor they'd goneto might not have been at home, and then they'd have to go on a goodishbit further.May started up on her elbow."Doctor!" she cried, in dismay. "You haven't sent for a doctor?""Yes, I have," answered Mr. Bragg, dismayed in his turn by her evidentdistress. "I couldn't do less. You might have been dying for anything Iknew. You don't know how bad you looked!""But I don't want a doctor. I'm quite well. I only want to go on. I wantto go on to Granny."And May's head fell back on the pillow, while a tear forced its waybeneath the closed eyelids."You came by the slow down, didn't you? Ah, well, there's no passengertrain going on that way before eleven-five to-night," observed theelderly female.At this intelligence the tears poured down May's cheeks, and she turnedaway her head on the cushion."Don't cry! Don't fret!" exclaimed Mr. Bragg. "You shall be inOldchester within an hour if the medical man says you're able to travel.I'll speak to the station-master at once. Only we _must_ hear what thedoctor says, mustn't we? I dursn't run a risk, now durst I? You see thatyourself. You're what you might call laid on my conscience to take careof. Good Lord, will this fool of a fellow never come back? I told him todrive as fast as he could pelt."May was crying now less from vexation than from exhaustion."I'm _not_ ill, indeed," she murmured, trying to check her tears."But, my dear young lady, people don't faint dead away like that, andlook so white and ghastly, without there's _something_ the matter. Itwasn't the news I told you upset you like that, surely?""No; of course not. I think it was because I--I had had no dinner.""Lord bless me!" cried Mr. Bragg. "Why, you're starving! _That's_ whatit is, then!"In his anxious solicitude for her Mr. Bragg would have orderedeverything eatable to be brought which the refreshment-room afforded.But he yielded to May's entreaty that she might have a cup of tea and apiece of bread. The attendant suggested a teaspoonful of brandy in thetea, but at this May shook her head. Mr. Bragg, however, thought thesuggestion a good one, and producing a small flask from his travellingbag, insisted on pouring a few drops of its contents into the cup oftea."That's fine old Cognac," he said; "like a cordial. I wouldn't ask youto swallow the stuff they sell here; but this'll do you nothing butgood. Dear me, if I'd only thought of giving you some of this before!"He was quite self-reproachful, and May had some difficulty in persuadinghim that no blame could possibly attach to him for not havingadministered a dose of brandy to her as soon as they met in the railwaycarriage.By this time the doctor sent for from Wendhurst had arrived. A briefinterview with his patient convinced him that she was perfectly wellable to travel on as far as Oldchester."Rather delicate nervous organization, you see," said the doctor to Mr.Bragg, when he left May. "And there has been some mental distress;family troubles, she tells me; and then the long fast, and the journey,quite sufficient to account--oh, thanks, thanks. She'll be all rightafter a good night's rest, I haven't the least doubt." And the doctorwithdrew with a bow; for Mr. Bragg, apologizing for having disturbed himand brought him so far through the rain, had put a handsome fee into hishand.Mr. Bragg had also mentioned in the hearing of the waiting-roomattendant, who was hovering inquisitively in the background, that theyoung lady had been put under his charge, and that he had just left thehouse of her great-uncle, Lord Castlecombe. He was aware that he himselfwas far too well-known a man in those parts for the adventure not to betalked about. And his experience of life had taught him that, while itis as difficult to check gossip as to bring a runaway horse to astandstill, yet that both may generally be turned to the right or left,by a cool hand.His sagacity was amply justified. For the waiting-room attendant, forweeks afterwards, would narrate to passing lady travellers how thatsweet young lady, Lord Castlecombe's grandniece, was so cut up by thedeath of her cousin that she fainted right away coming back from thefuneral at Combe Park, not having been able to touch food for more thantwelve hours in consequence of her grief; and how Mr. Bragg, the greatOldchester manufacturer, who was taking charge of the young lady on herjourney home, was so kind and anxious, and quite like a father to her;and how they both repeatedly said, "Mrs. Tupp, if it hadn't been foryour care and attention, we don't know whatever we _should_ have done."Soon after the doctor had departed, Mr. Bragg came back to May, andinformed her that arrangements had been made for their starting forOldchester in three-quarters of an hour, if that would be agreeable toher. And in reply to her wondering inquiry as to how that could havebeen managed, he said quietly, "Oh, I've got a special train. I'm adirector of this line, and they know me here pretty well."May had always understood that a special train was an immensely costlymatter. But in her ignorance she was by no means sure that it might notbe part of the privileges of a railway director to have special trainsrun for his service gratis, whensoever he should require them. Which,probably, was precisely what Mr. Bragg desired her to suppose.He then called aside the attendant, and held a short colloquy with herin the adjoining room, the result of which was to put the worthy Mrs.Tupp into a great fuss and flutter. She dashed at a cupboard in the walland plunged her hand into it, drawing it out again with a battered oldblack bonnet dangling by one string, as though she had been fishing at aventure and brought up _that_ rather unexpectedly. Further, Mrs. Tupp,with many apologies, took the checked shawl which had been laid overMay's feet and put it on her own shoulders; and then, assuring Mr.Bragg, in a speech which it took some time to deliver, that she wouldn'tbe gone not ten minutes, for her house was close by--better than half amile before you really come into Wendhurst High Street, going theshortest way from the station--she finally disappeared."Now, Miss Cheffington," said Mr. Bragg, "I want you to do something tooblige me. Will you?""Most gladly, if I can; but I'm afraid it will turn out to be somethingto oblige _me_," answered May, looking up at him timidly. "Don't youwant some food? I dare say you do.""Why, no, Miss Cheffington, I can't say I do; I ate a most uncommonhearty luncheon. I wonder why people always eat so much when there's afuneral going on! Besides, it isn't dinner-time yet, you know.""Isn't it? I have no idea what o'clock it is. If you told me it was themiddle of next week, I don't think I should feel surprised," and shesmiled with one of her old, bright looks."That's right," said Mr. Bragg. "You're picking up. Well, now, I wasgoing to say that I noticed in the refreshment-room a cold roast fowl,which didn't look at all nasty; no, really, not at all nasty," insistedMr. Bragg, with the air of one who is aware that his statement may notunreasonably be received with incredulity. "And if you'll let them bringit in here on a tray, and try to eat a bit of it, and drink another cupof tea--no! I promise not to put any brandy in it,--I shall esteem it afavour."Of course there was no refusing this. But May said wistfully, "I wasgoing to ask you--would you mind--I have something to say to you; and ifI don't say it soon that woman will be here. She is coming backimmediately.""Why, as to that, Miss Cheffington, I don't think she is. From what Ican make out, she's the kind of person that never can realize tothemselves that fifteen minutes, one after the other, end to end, makeup a quarter of an hour. She lost a lot of time here talking, and I sawher stop to tell the young woman at the bar over yonder what a hurry shewas in. No; I make no doubt but what she'll be back before we start, butnot just yet awhile."The roast chicken and some freshly made tea were brought in due course,and Mr. Bragg had the satisfaction of seeing May partake of both. Thenhe professed his readiness to hear what she wished to say."Are you comfortable? Light not too much for you? There! Now--providedyou don't overtire yourself, nor yet what you might call overtryyourself--I'm listening."He sat down in a chair nearly opposite to the fire, so that his profilewas turned to May, and looked thoughtfully into the hot coals, foldinghis arms in an attitude of massive quietude which was characteristic ofhim."First of all, you must let me thank you for all your kindness," saidMay."No, don't do that," he answered, without removing his gaze from thefire. Then he repeated musingly, "No, no; don't do that! Don't ye dothat!"Then ensued a pause. It lasted so long that Mr. Bragg, glancing round atthe girl, said--"That wasn't all you had in your mind to say, was it?""No, Mr. Bragg.""Perhaps you've changed your mind about speaking? Well, don't you worrityourself. You do just what you feel most agreeable to yourself, youknow.""But I want to speak! I was so anxious to tell you----This chance, whichI could never have expected or dreamt of, gives me the opportunity, andnow--now I don't know how to begin!"He was silent for a moment, pondering. Then he said, "Could I help you?I wonder if it is about a certain conversation you and me had together afew days back?""Yes--partly.""Well, now, you remember that on that occasion I said to you that Ihoped we might be friends, you and me--real, true friends. You remember,don't you?""Gratefully.""Well, I meant what I said. If you have been----" He was about to say"persecuted," but changed the word. "If you have been any way botheredin consequence of that conversation, I'm truly sorry for it. But don'tlet it make any difference as between you and me. Your aunt, Mrs.Dormer-Smith, she's a most well-meaning lady, and has beautiful manners.But she's liable to make mistakes like the rest of us. And don't youfret, you know. You're going to your grandmother, Mrs. Dobbs, you tellme. And she's a woman of wonderful good sense. She'll understand somethings better than what your aunt can. It'll be all right. Don't youworrit yourself."He spoke in a gentle, soothing tone, such as one might use to a child,and kept nodding his head slowly as he spoke, still with his eyes fixedon the fire."It isn't that! I mean--I wanted to tell you something!"He turned his head now quickly, and looked at her. Her eyes were castdown, and she was plucking nervously at the fur lining of the cloakwhich lay on the seat beside her."Is it something about that confidence that you made me, and that I lookupon as an honour, and always shall? Well, now, if you're going to speakabout that, I shall take it as a sign that you really mean to be friendswith me, and trust me. And there's nothing in the world would make me soproud as that you should trust me, full and free."Then she told him all the story of her engagement to Owen. How it hadbeen kept secret for three months by her grandmother's expressstipulation. How, when Owen returned to England, they had revealed it toMrs. Dormer-Smith; how that lady had disapproved and forbidden Owen thehouse, and had written to Captain Cheffington requesting him tointerpose his parental authority; how, finally, May had felt somiserable and lonely, that she had made up her mind to leave her aunt'shouse and take refuge with her grandmother.Mr. Bragg sat like a rock while she told her story, hesitatingly andshyly at first, but gathering courage as she went on. When she firstmentioned Owen's name, his brows contracted for a moment, in a way whichmight mean anger, or perplexity, or simply surprise. But he remainedotherwise quite unmoved to all appearance, and perfectly silent.When May had finished her little story, she said timidly, as she hadsaid to him on that memorable day in her aunt's house, "You are notangry, Mr. Bragg?"He answered nearly as he had answered then, but without looking at her,and keeping his gaze on the fire, "Angry, my child! No; how could I beangry with you? You have never deceived me. You have been true andhonest from first to last.""But I mean, you are not--you are not angry with Owen?"The answer did not come quite so promptly this time; but after a fewseconds, he said, "I don't know that I've the least right to be angrywith Mr. Rivers. Only I should have liked it better if he had told mehow things were, plain and straightforward, when we were talkingabout--something else." He brought his speech to an abrupt conclusion.Upon this May assured him that Owen had never desired secrecy. Theengagement had been kept secret in deference to "Granny." And as soon asher aunt knew it, Owen had urged her (May) to tell Mr. Bragg also,feeling himself in a false position until the truth was revealed."I ought to have written to you yesterday," she said guiltily. "It's myfault, indeed it is!"Mr. Bragg got up from his chair, and muttering something about "gettinga little air," walked out on to the long platform.There was certainly no lack of air outside there. A damp raw wind wasdriving through the station, making the lamps blink. Mr. Bragg had nogreat coat, that garment having been rolled up to serve as May's pillow.But he marched up and down the long platform with his hands behind hisback, at a steady and by no means rapid pace, apparently insensible tothe cold.Owen Rivers! So the man May was engaged to was his secretary, Mr.Rivers! That was very surprising. Mr. Rivers was not at all the sort ofman he should have expected that exquisite young creature to care about.But Mr. Bragg would have been puzzled to describe the sort of man hewould have expected her to care about. He had never seen any man hethought worthy of her, and it might safely be predicted that he neverwould; seeing that Mr. Bragg was in love with May, and would certainlynever be in love with May's husband, let him be the finest fellow in theworld.One suspicion he at once dismissed from his mind--that Owen had everbeen in the least danger from Mrs. Bransby's fascinations. No; when aman was betrothed to a girl like May Cheffington he was safe enough fromanything of that kind, argued Mr. Bragg. Indeed, his visit to thewidow's house had given him a favourable impression of all its inmates.It was impossible, he thought, to be in Mrs. Bransby's presence withoutperceiving her to be worthy of respect. Searching his memory, hediscovered that the first hint of her having any designs on young Rivershad come from Theodore Bransby, and now the motive of the hint began todawn upon him. Theodore, as he had long ago perceived, hated Rivers. Mr.Bragg now understood why. He paced up and down the draughty platform,solitary and meditative, for full ten minutes. It was a dead time, andthe whole station seemed nearly deserted.Then he returned to the waiting-room, of which May was still the soleoccupant. He stirred the fire into a blaze, and then sat down oppositeto it as before. May looked at him nervously and anxiously. She did notventure to speak first."I'll tell you one thing, Miss Cheffington," said Mr. Bragg, all atonce. "What you told me has been a relief to my mind in one way."She looked up inquiringly."Yes, it has been a relief to my mind, and I'm bound to acknowledge it.I was afraid at one time--indeed, I'd almost made up my mind, thoughterribly against the grain--that you was engaged to some one else.""Some one else!" exclaimed May, opening great eyes of wonder, andspeaking in a tone which conveyed her _naif_ persuasion that, in thatsense, there did not exist any one else. "Why, whom can you mean?"Mr. Bragg reflected an instant. Then he said, "I'll tell you. Yes, I'lltell you, for he's tried to thrust it in people's faces as far as hedared. Mr. Theodore Bransby."May fell back on her seat with a gesture of mute astonishment."Ah, yes; you're wondering how I could be such a blockhead as to thinkthat possible. But if it had been true, you'd ha' wondered how I couldbe such a blockhead as to think anything else possible," said Mr. Bragg.It was the sole touch of bitterness which escaped him throughout theinterview. After a brief pause he went on, "Not, you understand, that Imean to deny Mr. Rivers is far superior to young Bransby--out of allcomparison, superior to him. I may, perhaps, consider Mr. Riversfort'nate beyond his merits. That's a question we won't enter into,because you and me can't help but look at it from different points ofview. But I must bear testimony that he's always behaved like a realgentleman in his duties with me; and, so far as I know, he's thoroughlyupright and honourable."May considered this to be but faint praise. But she graciously madeallowances. Granny, however, knew better. When Mr. Bragg's words wererepeated to Granny, she exclaimed, "Well done, Joshua Bragg! That wasspoken like a generous-minded man."By this time the engine which was to draw them to Oldchester was inreadiness. Mr. Bragg inquired impatiently for the "good lady" of thewaiting-room. And then May learned that that person was to accompanythem on the journey, lest Miss Cheffington should need any attendance onthe way."And, indeed," said Mrs. Tupp, afterwards, "if the young lady had been aprincess royal, there couldn't have been more fuss made over her. S'looncarriage, and everything! Of course, it was an effort for me to go alongwith 'em at such short notice, and so entirely unexpected. But as theysaid to me, 'Mrs. Tupp,' they said, 'had it not have been for yourkindness and attention, we don't know what we should have done.' And thegentleman certainly made it worth my while." As he certainly did!At the present moment, however, Mrs. Tupp was by no means in acomplacent frame of mind. She was seen hurriedly approaching from theextremity of the station, very breathless and exhausted, attired in herSunday bonnet, and shawl to match, confronting Mr. Bragg, who stood,sternly, watch in hand, at the door of the carriage."I told you so, Miss Cheffington," said he to May, who was already madeluxuriously comfortable within the carriage. "Now, ma'am! No, don'ttrouble yourself to explain, please. Because in exactly two seconds anda half we're off. _Would_ you be so kind?" This to a guard who stoodlooking on beside the station-master. In a moment they had taken Mrs.Tupp between them, and, assisted from behind by a youthful porter,managed to hoist her into the carriage by main force. Mr. Bragg took hisplace opposite to May. The whistle sounded, and they glided from beneaththe roof of the station, and at an increasing speed across the darkcountry through the streaming rain.CHAPTER XII."And you got jealous! You actually were jealous of Owen and that poor,dear, pretty Mrs. Bransby?""Yes, Granny.""And you were such a _goose_--I won't use a stronger word, though Icould--as to pay any attention to what that idiot of an aunt ofyours--Lord forgive me!--chose to say in her anger and disappointment?""Yes, Granny.""And you let the jabber of poor Amelia Simpson--as kind a soul as everbreathed, but as profitable to listen to as the chirping of sparrows onthe house-top--prey upon your mind, and bias your common sense?""Yes, Granny.""Why, then, I'm ashamed of you, May! Downright ashamed--there now!""Oh, thank you, Granny!"And May seized her grandmother's hands one after the other as the oldwoman drew them away impatiently, and kissed them in a kind of rapture.This little scene, with but slight variations, had been enacted severaltimes since May's arrival on the previous evening at Jessamine Cottage.May had ceased to make any excuses for herself, or to endeavour todescribe and account for her state of mind. She was only too thankful tohave her doubts treated with supreme disdain. To be scolded and chidden,and told that she did not deserve such a true lover as Owen, was suchhappiness as she could not be grateful enough for!"Jealous of Owen because a parcel of mischievous magpies had nothingbetter to do than to dig their foolish bills into a poor widow'sreputation? Why, I think you must have had softening of the brain!" Mrs.Dobbs would say. Whereupon May would kneel down, and bury her face inher grandmother's lap, and laugh and cry, and murmur in a smotheredvoice--"Bless you, Granny darling!""Not but what," Mrs. Dobbs admitted afterwards in a privateconfabulation with Jo Weatherhead, "not but what I do think it's prettywell enough to soften any one's brain to undergo a long course of Mrs.Dormer-Smith. I thought I knew pretty well what she was, and I told youso long ago, Jo Weatherhead, as you must well remember. But, mercy! Ihadn't an idea! Her goings on, from what the child tells me, and that_fool_ of a letter she's written to me, display a wrongheadedness and anaggravating kind of imbecility that beats everything."Mr. Weatherhead, for his part, was inclined to be seriously wrathfulwith everybody who had contributed to make May unhappy--not excludingMr. Owen Rivers, who, said Jo, might have had more gumption than to rushto Mrs. Bransby's the moment he returned to England, and make such afuss about her, just as though _she_, and not May, were the object ofhis solicitude and affection."And I think, Sarah," said honest Jo, "that you're too hard on Miranda.It's all very fine, but it seems to me that she _had_ enough, and morethan enough, to make her uneasy. What with disagreeable things beingdinned into her ears from morning to night, and facts that couldn't bedenied, interpreted all wrong, and no friend near to interpret 'emright, and her own modesty and humble-mindedness making her suspect thatthe young man had offered to her before he was sure of his own mind, andhad begun to repent--take it altogether, I consider it's unkind andunfair to bully her as you do, Sarah, and so I tell you.""You do, do you?" answered Mrs. Dobbs, who had listened with muchcomposure to this attack. "Well, I'm not likely to quarrel with you for_that_. But you needn't worry yourself about May. I think I understandthe case pretty well. If you doubt it, just try sympathizing with her,and telling her you think Mr. Rivers behaved bad and thoughtless. You'llsee how pleased she'll be with you, and what a lot of gratitude you'llget for taking her part. Try it, Jo."Mr. Weatherhead, on reflection, did not try it.The unexpected legacy from Lucius Cheffington to his cousin was hailedby Mrs. Dobbs with heartfelt thankfulness. May's account of it at firstwas a very vague one. She had only imperfectly heard Mr. Bragg'scommunication in the railway carriage. And, indeed, at that moment, ithad seemed to her an affair of very secondary importance. But now, whenit occurred to her that this money would render them so independent asto put it out of the question for Owen to have to seek his fortune inSouth America, or any other distant part of the world, she was as elatedby it as the best regulated mind could desire."And it isn't so _very_ much money, after all, is it, Granny?" she said,with an air of satisfaction, which Mrs. Dobbs did not quite understand."Well," she answered, "it seems a pretty good deal of money to me.Between four and five hundred a year, as I understand.""Yes; but it isn't a _fortune_. Mr. Bragg said it wasn't a fortune. Imean--it is very little more than Owen has with what he earns, Granny.""Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Dobbs, a light beginning to dawn upon her. "I see.Well, you can't have the proud satisfaction of marrying him without apenny belonging to you. But perhaps he might take a situation for fiveyears on the Guinea Coast, so as to bring his income up above yours.""Oh, Granny!""Why not? It would be quite as natural and sensible as his wanting tomarry poor Mrs. Bransby and her five children. Things are getting toocomfortable to be let alone. The least he can do is to undergo a courseof yellow fever, and----""Granny, how can you?" And the young arms were round Granny, and theblushing face hidden in Granny's breast."Was I ever so foolish about Dobbs, I wonder?" murmured Mrs. Dobbs, asshe stroked the girl's hair. "He was a good-looking young fellow, wasIsaac, in our courting days, and a temper like a sunshiny morning, andwe were over head and ears in love, I know that; and--yes, I believe Iwas every bit as soft-hearted and silly, the Lord be praised!"Mr. Bragg called at Jessamine Cottage about noon the day after May'sreturn. He asked to see Mrs. Dobbs, and remained talking with her alonefor some time. He had made up his mind, he told her, to give Mr. Riversa permanent post in his employment, if he chose to accept it. He thoughtof offering him the management of the Oldchester office, if, after athree months' trial, he found it suited him, and he suited it. There wasno technical knowledge of the manufacture needed for this post: merely aclear head, honesty, the power of keeping accounts, and of conducting alarge business correspondence."I think he can do it," said Mr. Bragg; "and, if he can, he may." Thenhe informed Mrs. Dobbs that he had telegraphed to Mr. Rivers to comedown to Oldchester. He would there find, at the office in Friar's Row, aletter with all details. "As for me," said Mr. Bragg, "I shall cross himon the road. I am going to town by the three-thirty express. You needn'tmention what I've told you to Miss C. I thought, perhaps, she'd likebetter to hear it--as an agreeable bit of news, I hope--from him."What more may have passed between them Granny never reported. He wentaway without seeing May, merely leaving a message, "His kind regards,and he hoped she was feeling well and rested.""Oh, I wish I had seen him!" exclaimed May, when this message wasfaithfully delivered by Granny. "I wanted so much to thank him again.It's too bad! I wonder why he went away without seeing me.""Do you?" said Granny shortly. "Well, perhaps he thought he'd had botherenough with you for one while. He's got other things to do besidesdancing attendance on young ladies who wander about the world, faintingfrom want of food, and requiring special trains, and all manner ofdainties." Privately she observed to Mr. Weatherhead that innocence wasmighty cruel sometimes, as could be exemplified any day by trusting ayoung child with a kitten."H'm! Mr. Bragg isn't exactly a kitten, Sarah," returned Jo."True, a kitten will scratch! He's a man, and a good 'un; and I'll tellyou what, Jo, if Joshua Bragg wanted his shoes blacked, I'd go down onmy old knees to do it for him."May's legacy was a great piece of news for Mr. Weatherhead. He was notonly delighted at it for her sake, but he enjoyed the importance ofdisseminating it. Jo went about the city from the house of oneacquaintance to another. He also looked in at the Black Bull, where heordered a glass of brandy-and-water in honour of May's good fortune. Theitem of news he brought was a welcome contribution to the general fundof gossip. The subjects of Mr. Lucius Cheffington's funeral, and how theold lord had taken the death, and whether Captain Cheffington would comeback to England now that he was the heir, and make it up with his uncle,were by this time beginning to be worn a little threadbare; or, at allevents, had lost their first gloss.In this way it speedily became known to those interested in the matterthat May Cheffington had arrived at her grandmother's house. Amongothers, the intelligence reached Theodore Bransby. Theodore had beenfrequently in Oldchester of late, on business of various kinds, chieflyconnected with the approaching election. He had never relinquished thehope of winning May; and he believed that the death of Lucius was acircumstance favourable to his hopes. He did not doubt that the new turnof affairs would bring Captain Cheffington to England forthwith; and heas little doubted that many doors--including Mr. Dormer-Smith's--wouldbe opened widely to Captain Cheffington now, which had been closed tohim for years. Moreover, Theodore was convinced that one immediateresult of her father's presence would be to separate May altogether fromMrs. Dobbs, and the unfitting associates who haunted her house, andclaimed acquaintanceship with Miss Cheffington. May, he knew, had a weakaffection for the vulgar old woman. But her father's authority would bestrong enough to sever her from Mrs. Dobbs; and, for the rest, CaptainCheffington was his friend; whereas he was instinctively aware that Mrs.Dobbs was not. Latterly, too, ever since his father's death, May'smanner to him had been very gentle.He was meditating these things as he walked up the garden path toJessamine Cottage. May caught sight of him from the window, and sprangup in consternation, crying to Granny to tell Martha he was not to beadmitted. Mrs. Dobbs, however, told May to run upstairs out of the way,and determined to receive the visitor herself."I'm so afraid he will persist in asking for me! He is wonderfullyobstinate, Granny!" said May, ready to fly upstairs at the first soundof the expected knock at the door."Ah!" rejoined Mrs. Dobbs, setting her mouth rather grimly, "so am I.Show the gentleman into the parlour, Martha."Theodore was ushered into the little room, and found Mrs. Dobbs seatedin state in her big chair. The place was far smaller and poorer than thehouse in Friar's Row, but in Theodore's eyes it was preferable. Therewas the possibility of some pretentions to gentility on the part of adweller in Jessamine Cottage, whereas Friar's Row, though it might,perhaps, be comfortable, was hopelessly ungenteel.Theodore, when he entered the room, made a low bow, which, unlike hissalutation on a former occasion, was distinctly a bow, and not anondescript gesture halfway between a bow and a nod. He had learned byexperience that it did not answer to treat Mrs. Dobbs _de haut en bas_.He also made a movement as if to shake hands; but this Mrs. Dobbsignored, and asked him to sit down, in a coldly civil voice.She had been knitting when he came in, but laid the needles and worstedaside on his entrance, and sat looking at him with her hands folded inher lap.Theodore could scarcely tell why, but this action seemed to preludenothing pleasant. There was an air of being armed at all points aboutthe old woman, as she sat there looking at him with a steady attentionunshared by her knitting. But possibly the work had been laid aside outof politeness. In any case, Theodore told himself that _he_ was notlikely to be disconcerted by such a trifle."How do you do, Mrs. Dobbs?" he asked, when he was seated."Very well, I'm much obliged to you."Here ensued a pause."It is some time since we met, Mrs. Dobbs.""It's over a twelvemonth since you called at my house in Friar's Row,Mr. Theodore Bransby."Another pause."There has been trouble in the Cheffington family since then," saidTheodore, at length. "Ah, how strange and unexpected was the death ofthe eldest son! Lucius, of course, was always delicate. Still, he mighthave lived. His death has been a sad blow to Lord Castlecombe."Theodore considered himself to be condescending and conciliatory, inthus assuming that Mrs. Dobbs took some part in the affliction of thenoble family. In his heart he resented her having the most distantconnection with them. But he intended to be polite."There has been trouble in other families besides the Cheffingtons,"returned Mrs. Dobbs gravely, with her eyes on the young man's mourninggarments."Oh! Yes. Of course. But no trouble with which you can be expected toconcern yourself," he answered. He was annoyed, and preserved his smoothmanner only by an effort."And, anyway," continued Mrs. Dobbs, "Lord Castlecombe's sons have leftno fatherless children, nor widows, nor any one to be desolate andoppressed--like your poor father did."Theodore raised his eyebrows in his favourite supercilious fashion."Your figurative language is a little stronger than the case requires,"he said."Widowhood is a desolate thing, and poverty oppressive. There's nofigure in that, I'm sorry to say.""Oh, really? I was not aware," said Theodore, nettled, in spite ofhimself, into showing some _hauteur_, "that Mrs. Bransby and her familyhad excited so much interest in you!""No; I dare say not. I believe you were not. I think it very likelyyou'd be surprised if you knew how many folks in Oldchester and out ofit are interested in them."The young man sat silent, casting about for something to say whichshould put down this old woman, without absolutely quarrelling with her.He was glad to remember that he had always disliked her. But he had comethere with a purpose, and he did not intend to be turned aside from it.Seeing that he did not speak, Mrs. Dobbs said, "Might I ask if you didme the favour to call merely to condole upon the death of my latedaughter's husband's cousin?"This was an opening for what he wanted to say, and he availed himself ofit. He replied, stiffly, that the principal object of his visit had beento see Miss Cheffington, who, he was told, had returned to Oldchester;and that, in one sense, his visit might be held to be congratulatory,inasmuch as Miss Cheffington inherited something worth having under hercousin's will. He did not fear being suspected of any interested motivehere. Besides that he was rich enough to make the money a matter ofsecondary importance; his conscience was absolutely clear on this score.He had desired, and offered, to marry May when she was penniless; hestill desired it, but truly none the more for her inheritance."Oh! So you've heard of the legacy, have you?" said Mrs. Dobbs."Heard of it! My good lady, I was present at the reading of the will.There were very few persons at the funeral; it was poor Lucius's wishthat it should be private, but I thought it my duty to attend. There arepeculiar relations between the family and myself, which made me desirousof paying that compliment to his memory. I think there was no otherstranger present except Mr. Bragg. You have heard of him? Of course! AllOldchester persons are acquainted with the name of Bragg. After theceremony Lord Castlecombe invited us into the library, and the will wasread. I understood that the deceased had wished its contents to be madeknown as soon as possible."This narration of his distinguished treatment at Combe Park was soothingto the young man's self-esteem. He ended his speech with patronizingsuavity. But Mrs. Dobbs remained silent and irresponsive."I wish," said Theodore, after vainly awaiting a word from her, "to seeMiss Cheffington, if you please."Mrs. Dobbs slowly shook her head. He repeated the request, in a louderand more peremptory tone."Oh, I heard you quite well before," she said composedly; "but I'm sorryto say your wish can't be complied with.""Miss Cheffington is in this house, is she not?""Yes, she is at home; but you can't see her."Theodore grew a shade paler than usual, and answered sharply, "But Iinsist upon seeing her." He threw aside the mask of civility. Itevidently was wasted here."'Insist' is an unmannerly word to use; and a ridiculous one under thecircumstances--which, perhaps, you'll mind more. You can't see mygranddaughter."He glared at her in a white rage. Theodore's anger was never of theblazing, explosive sort. If fire typifies that passion in most persons,in him it resembled frost. His metal turned cold in wrath; but it wouldskin the fingers which incautiously touched it. A fit of serious angerwas apt, also, to make him feel ill and tremulous."May I ask why I cannot see her?" he said, almost setting his teeth ashe spoke."Because she wishes to avoid you. She fled away when she saw youcoming," answered Mrs. Dobbs, with pitiless frankness.He drew two or three long breaths, like a person who has been runninghard, before saying, "That is very strange! It is only a few days agothat Miss Cheffington was sitting beside me at dinner; talking to me inthe sweetest and most gracious manner.""As to sitting beside you, I suppose she had to sit where she was put!And as to sweetness--no doubt she was civil. But, at any rate, shedeclines to see you now. She has said so as plain as plain English canexpress it.""Your statement is incredible. Suppose I say I don't believe it! Whatguarantee have I that you are telling me the truth?""None at all," she answered quietly.He stared blankly for a moment. Then he said, "Mrs. Dobbs, for somereason, or no reason, you hate me. That is a matter of perfectindifference to me." (His white lips, twitching nostrils, and icilygleaming eyes, told a different tale.) "But I am not accustomed to betreated with impertinence by persons of your class.""Only by your betters?" interpolated Mrs. Dobbs."And, moreover, I shall take immediate steps to inform CaptainCheffington of your behaviour. He will scarcely approve his daughter'sremaining with a person who--who----""Says, she'd rather not see Mr. Theodore Bransby.""Who insults his friends. With regard to Miss Cheffington, I have nodoubt you will endeavour to poison her mind against me. But you maypossibly find yourself baffled. I have made proposals to MissCheffington--no doubt you are acquainted with the fact--which, althoughnot immediately accepted, were not definitively rejected: at least, notby the young lady herself. And I shall take an answer from no one else.Miss Cheffington's demeanour to me, of late, has been distinctlyencouraging. If it be now changed, I shall know quite well to whose lowcunning and insolent interference to attribute it. But you may findyourself mistaken in your reckoning, Mrs. Dobbs. Captain Cheffington ismy friend: and Captain Cheffington will hardly be disposed to leave hisdaughter in such hands when I tell him all."He was speaking in a laboured way, and his lips and hands weretremulous.Mrs. Dobbs looked at him gravely, but with no trace of anger. "Lookhere," she said when he paused, apparently from want of breath--"you mayas well know it first as last--May is engaged to be married; has beenengaged more than three months."Theodore gave a kind of gasp, and turned of so ghastly a pallor thatMrs. Dobbs, without another word, went to a closet in the room, unlockedit, took out a decanter with some sherry in it, poured out a brimmingglassful of the wine, and, placing one hand behind the young man's head,put the glass to his lips with the other. He made a feeble movement toreject it."Off with it!" she said in the voice of a nurse talking to a refractorychild.He swallowed the sherry without further resistance, and a tinge ofcolour began to return to his face."You haven't got too much strength," observed Mrs. Dobbs, as she stoodand watched him. "Your mother was delicate, and I suppose you take afterher."She had no intention, no consciousness, of doing so, but, in speakingthus, she touched a sensitive chord. Any allusion to his mother's feebleconstitution made him nervous. He closed his eyes, and murmured that hefeared he had caught a chill at the funeral; that the sensation ofshivering pointed to that.Mrs. Dobbs stood looking down on him as he sat with his head thrown backin the chair."And so, my lad, you think I hate you?" she said. "Why, I should besorry to be obliged to hate your father's son; or, for that matter, yourmother's son either. She was a good, quiet, peaceable sort of youngwoman. I remember her well, and your grandfather, old Rabbitt, that keptthe Castlecombe Arms when I was young. No; I don't hate you. Not a bit!But I'll tell you what I do hate; I hate to see young creatures, thatought by rights to be generous, and trusting, and affectionate, andmaybe a little bit foolish--there's a kind of foolishness that's betterthan over-wisdom in the young--I hate to see 'em setting themselves up,valuing themselves on their 'cuteness; ashamed of them that have gonebefore 'em. I hate to see 'em hard-hearted to the helpless. Young thingsmay be cruel from thoughtlessness; but, to be cruel out ofmeanness--well, I'll own I do hate that. But as for you, it comes intomy head that perhaps I've been a bit too hard on you."Mrs. Dobbs here laid her broad hand on his shoulder. He would fain haveshaken it off. But, although the wine had greatly restored him, hethought it prudent to remain quiet, and recover himself completelybefore going away."You are but a lad to me," continued Mrs. Dobbs. "And perhaps I've beenhard on you. There's a deal of excuse to be made. You love mygranddaughter, after your fashion--and nobody can love better than hisbest--and it's bitter not to be loved again. You'll get over it. Folkswith redder blood in their veins than you, have got over it beforeto-day. But I know you can't think so now; and it's bitter. But ifyou'll take an old woman's advice--an old woman that knew your motherand grandmother, and is old enough to be your grandmotherherself--you'll just make up your mind to bear a certain amount of painwithout flinching:--like as if you'd got a bullet in battle, or brokeyour collar-bone out hunting--and turn your thoughts to helping otherfolks in their trouble. There's no cure for the heart-ache like that,take my word for it. Come now, you just face it like a man, and try myrecipe! You've got good means and good abilities. Do some good with 'em!Some young fellows when they're out of spirits, take to climbing upmountains, slaughtering wild beasts, or getting into scrimmages withsavages--by the way, I did hear that you were going into Parliament--butthere's your stepmother now, with her five children, your young brothersand sisters, on her hands. Just you go in for making her life easier.There's a good work ready and waiting for you."Theodore moved his shoulder brusquely, and Mrs. Dobbs immediatelywithdrew her hand. He stood up and said stiffly, "I must offer you myacknowledgments for the wine you administered."Mrs. Dobbs merely waved her hand, as though putting that aside, andcontinued to look at him, with a grave expression, which was not withouta certain broad, motherly compassion."I presume the name of the man to whom Miss Cheffington has engagedherself is not a secret?""It is Mrs. Hadlow's nephew; Mr. Owen Rivers," answered Mrs. Dobbssimply.He had felt as sure of what she was going to say as though he had seenthe words printed before him; nevertheless, the sound of the name seemedto pierce him like a sword-blade. He drew himself up with a strongeffort to be cutting and contemptuous. But as he went on speaking, helost his self-command and prudence."Miss Cheffington is to be congratulated, indeed! Captain Cheffingtonwill, no doubt, be delighted at the alliance you have contrived for hisdaughter! Mr. Owen Rivers! A clerk in Mr. Bragg's counting-house--which,however, is probably the most respectable occupation he has everfollowed! Mr. Owen Rivers, whose name is scandalously connectedthroughout Oldchester with that of the person you were so kind as torecommend to my good offices just now! A person whose conduct disgracesmy family, and dishonours my father's memory! Mr. Owen Rivers, who----""Hush! Hold your tongue!" cried Mrs. Dobbs, fairly clapping one handover his mouth, and pointing with the other to the window.There at the bottom of the garden was Owen, hurriedly alighting from acab; and May, who had witnessed his arrival from an upper window,presently came flying down the pathway into his arms.Theodore had but a lightning-swift glimpse of this little scene, forMrs. Dobbs saying, "Come along here!" resolutely pulled him by the arminto a back room, and so to a door opening on to a lane behind thehouse. He was astonished at this summary proceeding, but he affectedsomewhat more bewilderment than he really felt, so as to cover hisretreat. And he muttered something about having to deal with a madwoman."Now go!" said Mrs. Dobbs, opening the door. "I can forgive a deal tolove and jealousy and disappointment, but that cowardly lie is not to beforgiven. To think that you--_you_--should be Martin Bransby's son! Why,it's enough to make your father turn in his grave!"And with that she thrust him out, and shut the door upon him.CHAPTER XIII.Mrs. Dormer-Smith's affectionate letter to her brother produced a resultwhich she had not at all anticipated when she wrote it. He arrived inEngland by the next steamboat from Ostend, and took up his quarters inher house. He had come ostensibly for the purpose of visiting CombePark, and patching up a reconciliation with his uncle. This, indeed, wasa pet scheme with Pauline. She had hinted at it in writing to herbrother. Now that George and "poor dear Lucius" were gone, LordCastlecombe might not dislike to be on good terms with his heir. He wasold and lonely, and, as Pauline's correspondents had assured her,greatly broken down by the death of his sons.Frederick scarcely knew which to regret the most--his niece's departureor his brother-in-law's arrival. He missed May very much, but veryshortly he began to be reconciled to her engagement. Rivers was agentleman and an honest fellow, and might be trusted to take care ofMay's money, which Mr. Dormer-Smith thought would be otherwise inimminent jeopardy from the arrival on the scene of May's papa.That gentleman, indeed, who had at first taken the news of hisdaughter's engagement with supreme indifference, showed some livelysymptoms of disapprobation on learning the fact of Lucius's bequest. Adaughter dependent on the bounty of Mrs. Dobbs for food, shelter, andraiment, was an uninteresting person enough; but a daughter whopossessed between four and five hundred a-year of her own, ought not tobe allowed to marry without her father's consent. Frederick drylyremarked that May's capital was stringently tied up in the hands oftrustees, whether she were married or single. Whereupon Augustusindulged in very strong language respecting his dead cousin; anddeclared that the terms of the will were a pointed and intentionalinsult to _him_, who was his child's natural guardian.Still, although the capital was secure, Frederick knew that the incomewas not. And the more he observed his brother-in-law, the more he felthow desirable it was that May should have a husband to take care of her.Captain Cheffington had not improved during his years of exile. Hesmoked all day long; and even at night in his bed, incensing May'schamber, which he occupied, with clouds of tobacco-smoke. He hadcontracted other unpleasant habits, and his temper was diabolical. Hehad not brought his wife to England with him. He would sit for hourswith his slippered feet on the fender in his sister's dressing-room,railing at the absent Mrs. Augustus Cheffington in a way which was mostgrievous to Pauline; for he showed not the least reticence in thepresence of Smithson. Talk of "floating"--how would it be possible to"float" a woman of whom her own husband spoke in that way?He had no very grave charges to bring against La Bianca after all. Shehad been faithful to him, and stuck to him, and worked for him. But hebewailed his fate in having tied himself to "a third-rate Italianopera-singer, without an idea in her head beyond painting her face andsqualling!" It was just his cursed luck. Why couldn't Lucius die, sincehe meant to die, six months earlier?At another time, he would openly rejoice in the death of his cousins,and express a fervent hope that the old boy wasn't going to last muchlonger. Pauline would remonstrate, and put her handkerchief to her eyes,and beg her brother not to speak so heartlessly of his own family:especially of "poor dear Lucius." But Augustus pooh-pooh'd this asconfounded humbug. He was uncommonly glad to be the heir of Combe Park,and thought it about time that his family, and his country, and thehuman race generally, made him some amends for the years he had passedunder a cloud! _He_ would show them how to enjoy life when he came intopossession of "his property," as he had taken to call Lord Castlecombe'sestate. He planned out several changes in the disposal of the land, anddecided what rent he would take for the house and home-park. For he didnot intend to live in this d----d foggy little island, where one hadbronchitis if one hadn't got rheumatism, and rheumatism if one hadn'tgot bronchitis. In one respect his visions coincided with his sister's,since he talked of having a villa on the Mediterranean coast, not farfrom Monte Carlo; but they differed from hers in several importantpoints: notably in providing no place for her in the villa.Frederick would sometimes throw a shade over these rosy dreams byobserving doggedly that, for his part, he doubted the likelihood of LordCastlecombe's speedy decease, and that, looking at them both, he wasinclined to consider Uncle George's life the better of the two; so that,on the whole, domestic life in Mr. Dormer-Smith's smart house atKensington was by no means harmonious. Meanwhile Pauline, withconsiderable pains and earnest meditation, composed a letter to heruncle on behalf of Augustus; she did not venture to entrust the task toAugustus himself. It would be impossible to persuade him to be as smoothand conciliatory as the case demanded. But she wrote a letter which, shethought, combined diplomacy with pathos, and from which she hoped forsome satisfactory result. But the reply she received by return of postwas of such a nature that she hastily thrust it into the fire lestAugustus should see it, and told him and her husband that "poor dearUncle George was not yet equal to the effort of seeing Augustus, afterthe great shock he had suffered." Uncle George had, in fact, stated inthe plainest terms that if Captain Cheffington ventured to show himselfin Combe Park, the servants had orders to turn him out forcibly!The object for which Captain Cheffington had come to England at thattime being thus baulked, it would have appeared natural that he shouldreturn to his wife in Brussels. But day followed day, until nearly threeweeks had elapsed since Lucius Cheffington's death, and still Augustusremained at Kensington. Every morning, with a dreadful regularity, Mr.Dormer-Smith inquired of his wife if she knew whether her brother weregoing away in the course of that day; and every morning the shower oftears with which Mrs. Dormer-Smith received the inquiry, and whichgenerally formed her only answer to it, became more copious. Augustus,on the whole, was the least uncomfortable of the trio. He had contrivedto raise a little ready money on his expectations; he was well lodgedand well fed; the change to London (now that he had a few pounds in hispocket) was not unwelcome after Brussels; and as to his brother-in-law'sundisguised dislike to his presence, he had grown far too callous toheed it, so long as it suited him to ignore it. Not but that he tooknote of it in his mind keenly enough, and promised himself the pleasureof paying off Frederick with interest, as soon as he should come into"his property."All this time a humble household in Oldchester was a great deal happierthan the wintry days were long. The news of Captain Cheffington'sarrival in England had at first disturbed May. Perhaps he might insiston seeing her; and she shrank from seeing him. But she thought it herduty to write to him and inform him herself of her engagement; andneither Owen nor her grandmother opposed her doing so.If May had any lingering illusion about her father, or any hope that hewould manifest some gleam of parental tenderness towards her, theillusion and the hope were short-lived. The reply to her communicationswas a hurried scrawl, haughtily regretting that Mr. Owen Rivers had notthought proper to wait upon him and ask his consent to the marriage,which he totally disapproved of! And adding that although Rivers ofRiversmead was undoubtedly good blood, it appeared that the traditionsof gentlemanlike behaviour had been lost by the present bearer of thename, since he entered the service of a tradesman. The letter ended witha peremptory demand for fifty pounds.May and Owen had planned that granny was to return to Friar's Row ontheir marriage. Mr. Bragg was willing to break the lease which he held,and to remove his office to another house hard by. And Mrs. Dobbs, withall her goods and chattels, was to be reinstated in her old home. Asthis scheme was to be kept secret from Granny for the present, itinvolved a vast deal of delightful mystery and plotting. Jo Weatherheadwas admitted to the conspiracy, and enjoyed it with the keenest relish.A word or two had been said as to Mrs. Dobbs taking up her abode withthe young couple when they should be married. But this Granny instantlyand inflexibly refused."No, no, children; I'm not quite so foolish as that! It's very well forOwen to take May for better for worse. But it would be a little too muchto take May and her grandmother for better for worse!"Of course it was not long before Owen took his betrothed to see Canonand Mrs. Hadlow. They walked together to the old house in College Quad,where, however, their news had preceded them. The Hadlows were verycordial. Both of them were very fond of May; and Aunt Jane loudly hopedthat Owen appreciated his good fortune, and declared it was far abovehis deserts, though in her heart she thought no girl in England too goodfor her favourite nephew. The lovers were affectionately bidden to comeagain as often as they could, and brighten up the old place with thesight of their happy young faces.They agreed, as they walked home together, that the home in College Quadseemed a little gloomy and lonely without Conny. Conny was still away.She had only been at home on a flying visit of a few days during severalmonths past. She was now staying with a Lady Belcraft, who had ahandsome house at Combe St. Mildred's. Mrs. Hadlow had told them so; anda word or two, uttered in the same breath, about Theodore Bransby beingoften in that neighbourhood, suggested a suspicion that Theodore mightbe thinking of returning to his old love. This idea annoyed Owenextremely. The hint which suggested it had been dropped almost in themoment of saying "good-bye" to Mrs. Hadlow, or he would have attemptedat once to sound her on the subject.He had interrogated his aunt privately--while May was being petted andmade much of by the kind old canon--as to a rumour which was rife inOldchester--namely, that Constance had been betrothed to LuciusCheffington. But Aunt Jane positively denied this. She admitted that thegossip bad reached her own ears, and that she had spoken to her daughterabout it."But Conny entirely disabused me of any such notion. She said that, inthe first place, nothing was farther from Lucius's thoughts thanlove-making; and that, in the second place, it would have been a mostimprudent marriage for her, since she could only expect to be speedilyleft a widow with a very slender jointure. Conny was never romantic, youknow," said Aunt Jane, with a quick, half-humorous glance at her nephew.Owen began to consider with himself whether it might not be his duty toacquaint Canon Hadlow with many parts of Theodore's conduct which werecertainly unknown to him. All inquiries conducted either by himself orby Jo Weatherhead--who ferreted out information with untiring zeal anddelight in the task--showed more and more plainly that the calumniesconcerning Mrs. Bransby could be traced, for the most part, to herstep-son, and in no single instance beyond him. May had long agoacquitted Constance Hadlow of speaking or writing evil things of thewidow. Constance had not, in fact, expended any attention whatever onthe Bransby family since their departure from Oldchester.She was spending her time very agreeably. Her hostess, Lady Belcraft,was a widow. She was a great crony of Mrs. Griffin's, and delighted withMrs. Griffin's _protegee_. Having, so to speak, retired from business onher own account (her two daughters being married and settled long ago),Lady Belcraft was still most willing to renew the toils of the chase onbehalf of a friend. She and Mrs. Griffin had carefully examined thecounty list of possible matches for Constance Hadlow; and had agreedthat there was good hope of a speedy find, a capital run, and asuccessful finish.It so happened that on the same afternoon when May and Owen were payingtheir visit to College Quad, Theodore Bransby was making a call at theresidence of Lady Belcraft in Combe St. Mildred's.Ever since his interview with Mrs. Dobbs--now several days ago--Theodorehad been considering his own case with minute and concentratedattention. We are all of us, it must be owned, supremely interesting toourselves; but Theodore's interest in himself was of a jealouslyexclusive kind. His health was undoubtedly delicate. He had felt theloss of a home to which he could repair when he was ailing or out ofsorts ever since his father's death. He found, too, that he was apt tobecome hipped and nervous when alone. He came to the conclusion that heneeded a wife to take care of him, and, after grave consideration, heresolved to marry Constance Hadlow.If he could by a word have destroyed Rivers and obtained possession ofMay Cheffington, he would have said that word without hesitation orremorse; but since that could not be, he did not intend to wear thewillow. He would marry Constance. That she would have accepted him longago he was well assured; and his circumstances were far more prosperousnow than in those days. Canon and Mrs. Hadlow could not but be impressedby his disinterestedness in coming forward now that he was in theenjoyment of a handsome independence. And, on his side, he believed hewas choosing prudently. If he were ill, the attentions of a wife--arefined and cultured woman, dependent, moreover, on him for the comfortof her daily life--would be far preferable to those of a hireling nurse,who would have the power of going away whenever she found her positiondisagreeable. But this was only one side of the question. When he grewstronger (he always looked forward to growing stronger) Constance wouldbe an admirable helpmate from a social point of view. She had acquiredinfluential friends, was received in the best houses, and would do histaste infinite credit, and whether as a politician or a barrister shemight have it in her power to forward his ambitions.It was as the result of these meditations that he called at LadyBelcraft's.He had met her occasionally in society, and she knew perfectly who hewas. But there was a distinct film of ice over the politeness with whichshe received him when he was ushered into her drawing-room. She thoughtthis little attorney's son was taking something like a liberty inappearing there uninvited. She forgave him, however, immediately when,in his most correct manner, he asked for Miss Hadlow.Really it might do, thought Lady Belcraft. The young man was very welloff, and presentable, and all that, and dear Conny, though simplycharming, had not a penny in the world (neither was dear Conny herladyship's own daughter). Yes; she positively thought it might do! Shewas so sorry that Miss Hadlow was not within, but she expected her everymoment. She was walking, she believed, in the park. "The Park" at CombeSt. Mildred's meant Combe Park. Oh, yes; she was aware that Mr. Bransbywas an old acquaintance. Playfellows from childhood? Really! That sortof thing always had such a hold on one--was so extremely----Oh, therewas dear Conny coming up the drive.Lady Belcraft sent a message by a servant, begging Miss Hadlow to comeinto the drawing-room, where she presently appeared.She was dressed in a winter toilet of carefully-studied simplicity, andlooked radiantly handsome. Theodore gazed at her as if he had never seenher before. Self-possessed she had always been, but she had now acquiredsomething more than that--an air of conscious distinction--of "beingsomebody," as Theodore phrased it in his own mind, which he admired andwondered at."Here's an old friend of yours, Conny," said Lady Belcraft.Constance had been pulling off her gloves as she entered the room, andshe now extended a white, well cared-for hand to Theodore, with a coollittle, "Oh, how d'ye do?" and the faintest of smiles.Her hostess thought within herself that if there really was anythingbetween her and young Bransby, Conny's behaviour was marvellous, andthat all the training bestowed on her own daughters had left them farbelow the point of finish attained by this provincial clergyman'sdaughter."Did you walk far? Are you tired?" she asked."No, thanks, dear Lady Belcraft; I am not at all tired. I went to myfavourite group of beeches. It's a capital day for walking. And what isthe news in Oldchester, Theodore?"Her calling him "Theodore" in the old familiar way seemed to have themysterious effect of putting him under her feet; it implied suchsuperiority and security. Theodore was conscious of this, but it did notdisplease him; she had doubtless resented his not making the expectedoffer earlier. He had thought when he met her in London that hurt_amoure propre_ had much to do with her cavalier treatment of him. Buthe had a charm to smoothe her ruffled plumes.After a little commonplace conversation, Lady Belcraft recollected someorders which she wanted to give personally to her gardener, and, with abrief excuse, left the room. Constance perfectly understood why she haddone so, Theodore did not; but he seized the occasion which, heimagined, hazard had thrown in his way."I am very glad of this opportunity of speaking with you alone,Constance," he began very solemnly.There was no trepidation such as he had felt in speaking to May. Heneither trembled, nor stammered, nor grew hot and cold by turns. Thatchapter was closed. He was turning over a new and quite different leaf."Yes?" said Constance. "Really!" She removed her hat, smoothed the thickdark braids of her hair before a mirror, and sat down with gracefulcomposure."I don't think we have met, Constance, since----" He glanced at hisblack clothes."No; I think not. I was very sorry. I begged mamma to give you a messagefrom me when she wrote to condole with Mrs. Bransby.""I merely allude to that sad subject in order to assure you that I amnot unmindful of what is proper and becoming under the circumstances;and lest you should think me guilty of heartless precipitation."He was beginning to enjoy the rounding off of his sentences--a pleasurehe had never tasted in May's company; strong emotion being unfavourableto polished periods."Oh, I don't think you were ever guilty of precipitation," answeredConstance quietly. But the mirror opposite reflected a flash of herhandsome eyes."Nothing," continued Theodore, "could be in worse taste than to neglectthe accustomed forms of respect. A period of twelve months would not betoo long to mourn for a parent so excellent as my father; but six monthscould not be considered to outrage decorum. And I should not urge----"He paused. He had been on the point of saying that he would not pressfor the marriage taking place before the summer, when he happilyremembered that he had not yet gone through the form of asking Constancewhether she would marry him or not. To him it seemed so like merelytaking up the thread of a story temporarily interrupted, that he hadlost sight of the probability that Constance's mind had not been keepingpace with his own on the subject. But it recurred to him in time.Constance was sitting on a low couch near the fireside, at some distancefrom him. He now took his place beside her. There was a certainawkwardness in making a proposal of marriage across a spacious room."There can be no need of many words between us, Constance," he began,with as much tenderness of manner as he could call up. Then he stopped.Constance had drawn away the skirt of her gown on the side next to him,and was examining it attentively. "What is the matter?" he asked."I thought you had accidentally set your boot on the hem of my frock,"she said. "And the roads are so muddy, although it is fine overhead! Butit's all right. I beg your pardon: you were saying----?"This interruption was disconcerting. He had had in his head an elaboratesentence which was now dispersed and irrecoverable. He must begin allover again. However, when fairly started once more, his eloquence didnot fail him. He offered his hand and fortune to Miss Hadlow, "in goodset terms."She was silent when he had finished, and he ventured to take her hand."Am I not to have an answer, dearest Constance?" he asked.She drew her hand away very gently and with perfect composure beforesaying, as she looked full at him with her fine dark eyes--"You are not joking, then?""_Joking!_""Well, I know you are not given to joking, and this would certainly bean inconceivably bad joke; but it is almost more inconceivable that youshould be in earnest."He was fairly bewildered, and doubtful of her meaning."However," she continued, "if you really expect a serious answer, youmust have it. No, thank you."He stood up erect and stiff, as if moved by a spring. She remainedleaning back in an easy attitude on the couch, and looking at him."I----Constance!----I don't understand you!" he exclaimed."I refuse you," she replied in a gentle voice, and with her best societydrawl. "Distinctly, decidedly, and unhesitatingly. I think you _must_understand that. Won't you stay and see Lady Belcraft?" (Theodore hadtaken up his hat, and was moving towards the door.) "Oh, very well. Iwill make your excuses."She rang the bell, which was within reach of her hand, and Theodorewalked out of the room without proffering another word.CHAPTER XIV.Canon Hadlow had resolved that his daughter, when she returned toOldchester for May's wedding, to which she was, of course, invited,should remain in her own home at least for some months. He had grownvery discontented with her prolonged and frequent absences. Mrs. Hadlow,at the earnest request of Constance, backed by a polite invitation fromLady Belcraft, went to Combe St. Mildred's to remain there one day, andbring her daughter back with her.But, instead of doing so, she sent a telegram home, desiring that a boxof clothes might be packed and sent to her; and, most surprising of all,the box was to be addressed to Dover. This item of news was disseminatedby the Hadlows' servant, whose duty it was to see the trunk conveyed tothe railway station. And the woman declared she believed, from what shecould make out, that her mistress was going to France.Of course, the canon knew the truth. But the canon was not visible tocallers. He had a cold, and kept his room. All the circle of theHadlows' acquaintance--and the circle seemed to be immediately widenedby the dropping into its midst of this puzzling bit of news, as a stonedropped into water is surrounded by a ring of ever-increasingcircumference--were, however, spared further conjecture by thepublication, in due course, of the supplement to the _Times_ newspaperof Tuesday, the twenty-seventh of February. It contained theannouncement of the marriage at the British Embassy in Paris, on thepreceding Saturday, of Viscount Castlecombe to Constance Jane, onlydaughter of the Reverend Edward Hadlow, Canon of Oldchester.The general public, or as much of it as had ever heard of the partiesconcerned--for that vast entity the general public is really asdivisible as a jelly-fish; each portion being perfect for all purposesof its existence, when cut off from the rest--was ranged, as is usual insuch cases, in two main camps; those who couldn't have believed itbeforehand, though an angel from Heaven had announced it, and those whohad all along had their suspicions, and were not so _very_ muchsurprised as you expected. But only the nearest friends and relatives ofthe family enjoyed the not inconsiderable advantage for judging thematter, of really knowing anything about it.Owen was the first person whom his uncle admitted to see him. The oldman was greatly overcome. His daughter's marriage was a blow to him. Itgave a rude shock to the ideal Constance, whom he had loved and admiredwith a sort of delicate paternal chivalry. There could be no question oflove in such a marriage as this--no question, even, of gratitude, orreverence, or any of the finer feelings. To the pure-hearted,simple-minded old man, it seemed to be a sad degradation for hisdaughter. Not a soul except his wife ever fully understood his state ofmind on the subject; for he spoke of it to no one. Mrs. Dobbs, perhaps,came nearest to doing so. She had a great reverence and admiration forthe canon, and considerable sympathetic insight into his feelings. Andwhen, afterwards, people said in her presence how proud and elated CanonHadlow must be at his daughter's making so great a match, she wouldtighten her lips, and observe _sotto voce_ that you might as well expecta Christian saint to be gratified by being decorated with the peacock'sfeather of a Chinese mandarin.When Mrs. Hadlow came home, of course more particulars were divulged.Many came out by degrees in confidential talks with her nephew. Mrs.Hadlow spoke to him quite openly.Constance had earnestly begged her mother to go to her at Combe St.Mildred's, and almost immediately on her arrival there had announcedthat she was about to marry Lord Castlecombe, and that everything wasarranged for the ceremony to take place in Paris; since, under thecircumstances, they both felt that it could not be managed too quietly.She much wished her mother and father to accompany her to Paris, inorder that everything might be _en regle_.When the first astonishment was over, Mrs. Hadlow impulsively tried todissuade her daughter from taking this step. It was dreadful, it wasreally monstrous to think of her Conny marrying that old man, who wasseveral years the senior of her own father! A man, too, of a hard,unamiable character--one who was much feared, little respected, andloved not at all! She was revolted by the idea. And as to the canon, shecould not bear to think of what he would feel. He would never allow it!It was hopeless to think of gaining his consent.When her mother's tearful excitement had somewhat subsided, Constancepointed out that she had a very sincere regard for Lord Castlecombe, whohad behaved in every way excellently towards her; that as to "falling inlove," as depicted by poets and novelists, she had her private opinion,which was, briefly, that all that was about as historically true as theadventures of Oberon and Titania; and that, at all events, she wassufficiently acquainted with her own character to be persuaded that_she_ was incapable of that species of temporary insanity. Further, withregard to her father's consent, she deeply regretted to hear that he waslikely to withhold it; since she would, in that case, be compelled tomarry without it, which would be very painful to her. (And when she saidthat it would be painful to her, her mother knew that she spoke quitesincerely.) She was of full age to judge for herself in the matter, andcould not think of breaking her word to Lord Castlecombe. She furtherpointed out that although, of course, Oldchester people would chatterabout her--she spoke already, as though she were looking down on thosecommon mortals from the serene and luminous elevation of some fixedstar--yet there could be nothing scandalous said if she were known to beaccompanied to Paris by her mother. As to papa, his health, and hisduties, and many other excuses might be alleged for his not undertakinga journey at that inclement season.Constance spoke with perfect calmness, and without the slightestdisrespect of manner. But Mrs. Hadlow was made aware within five minutesthat nothing on earth which she had power to say or do would, for aninstant, shake her daughter's resolve to be a viscountess. There wasnothing to be done but to put the best face possible on the matter, andgo to Paris. She could not allow her child to travel thither alone. Thebridegroom had already preceded them, to make all needful preparations.Poor Mrs. Hadlow was in such a whirl of confusion and emotion asscarcely to know what she was doing or saying. "Had Lady Belcraft knownof this?" she asked. Constance smiled rather scornfully, as she repliedthat nobody would be more surprised than poor dear Lady Belcraft whenshe should learn the news. No; Conny was not going to share the glory ofher capture with any one. And, in truth, such glory as belonged to itwas all her own.Mrs. Griffin, on hearing the news, was at first half inclined to besharp and spiteful at being kept in the dark. (Although, of course, shedid not allow herself to continue in that vulgar frame of mind.) ButLady Belcraft was subdued, and almost prostrate in spirit before thisgifted young creature. "She's a wonderful young woman, my dear--awonderful young woman!" declared Lady Belcraft.Just before they landed from the steamboat at Calais, Constance said toher mother, "Mamma, I do think you and papa are the most unworldlypeople I ever heard of! You have never thought of saying a single wordabout settlements."Mrs. Hadlow started, and looked blankly at her daughter. She stoodrebuked. "I have felt, ever since you told me, as if I had received astunning blow on the head which deprived me of half my faculties," sheanswered. "But I ought to have thought of that. It is not too late now,perhaps, to secure some provision for you; is it, Conny?""I should not have thought of marrying Lord Castlecombe without a propersettlement, mamma. We might have been married a fortnight ago if it hadnot been for the delays of the lawyers; although matters were simplifiedfor them by my having nothing at all! I am quite satisfied with thearrangements, and I hope you and papa will be so too. I think you willadmit that Lord Castlecombe has been very generous."Mrs. Hadlow was a woman of bright intelligence, and she had been apt toconsider Conny a little below the Rivers' standard of brains; but now,as she looked and listened, she felt tempted to exclaim, like LadyBelcraft, that this was a wonderful young woman.But what words can paint the effect of that fateful announcement in the_Times_ on the family party assembled in Mr. Dormer-Smith's house atKensington!Augustus behaved so outrageously, used such vituperative language, andcomported himself altogether with such violence, that his brother-in-lawprivately fortified himself by securing the presence of a policeman wellin view of the windows, on the opposite side of the way, beforerequesting Captain Cheffington to withdraw at once from his house. Muchto his surprise, and immensely to his relief, the request was compliedwith promptly. Captain Cheffington disappeared in a hansom cab, with asmart travelling-bag, and followed by a second vehicle containing twowell-filled portmanteaus. Whereas, as James cynically remarked to thecook, a cigar-case and a tooth-pick was about the amount of his luggagewhen he arrived! James had not been fee'd. Augustus asserted his claimto be considered one of the family by swearing at the servants, andnever giving any of them a sixpence. The explanation of this speedydeparture was shortly forthcoming in the shape of a variety of bills,which poured in with astonishing rapidity. Augustus also, as has beenstated, had been clever enough to raise a little money on the strengthof his heirship. And Mr. Dormer-Smith had to endure some contumely fromcreditors who had looked to getting something like twenty-five per cent.above market-prices out of the captain, and were roused to a frenzy ofmoral indignation when they discovered that he was safe out of England,and beyond their reach.To Pauline the blow was the more severe because she persuaded herselfthat she had been the victim of black ingratitude on the part ofConstance."_That_ girl!" she would murmur, weeping. "That girl, whom I held up asa model--and who really did behave perfectly when she was here--quite_perfectly_--to think of that girl being the one to turn round on thefamily in this treacherous way! I do not know how I shall endure to seeher face again.""Then don't see it," suggested Frederick. "If you think she has behavedso badly, cut her, and have done with it.""Cut her!" exclaimed Pauline, sitting up from among the pillows in her_chaise longue_, with a vinagrette in one hand and a pocket-handkerchiefin the other. "How can I cut my uncle's wife? She is now LadyCastlecombe, Frederick! You seem to have no idea that private feelingsmust give way to the duty one owes to society. I wonder who will presenther. I dare say Mrs. Griffin will persuade the duchess to do it. Itwould not surprise me at all. Probably they will open the town housenow, and come up every season. Cut her! Frederick, you talk like thatNihilist who is going to marry poor darling May!"Frederick more than ever thought that "poor darling May" was to becongratulated on having secured the love and protection of the honestyoung Englishman to whom his wife persisted in attributing anarchicalprinciples. He wrote a kind letter, in which he proposed to come down toOldchester and give his niece away at the marriage, if that would beagreeable to her and Mr. Rivers. May's affectionate heart was overjoyedby this proposal. A joint letter, signed by May and Owen, was sent byreturn of post, in which both Aunt Pauline and Uncle Frederick werewarmly invited to the wedding. And May put in a special petition thatHarold and Wilfred should be allowed to be present. Granny would find anook for them in Jessamine Cottage.May also sent an invitation to Mrs. Bransby to be present, but shereplied that she would not bring her black gown to be a blot on theirbrightness, but that no more loving prayers would be breathed for theirhappiness than those of their affectionate friend Louisa Bransby.Neither did Aunt Pauline accept the invitation. She did not writeunkindly. Her reply seemed to be, indeed, a sort of homily on the text--    "How all unconscious of their doom    The little victims play."It was a sad business, but she was mildly compassionate and forbearing.But the best of all was that Harold and Wilfred were to be permitted tocome. In fact, their father insisted on bringing them, to theirinexpressible rapture. They took to Granny at once, and she had to keepa watch upon her tongue lest she should let slip before Mr. Dormer-Smiththe words she had said on first seeing the children--"Poor dear motherless little fellows!"On the wedding morning a letter arrived for Mrs. Dobbs from Mr. Bragg.Mr. Bragg was about to sail for Buenos Ayres on a twelve-months' visitto his son. Before going away, he thought it would be agreeable to Mayand her husband, he wrote, to be the means of communicating something toMrs. Bransby, which he hoped would be to her advantage. The new premiseswhich he had taken for his office, now removed from Friars' Row, were tobe furnished throughout, and a couple of rooms reserved for Mr. Bragg'suse whenever he wished to come into Oldchester from his country house.Under these circumstances, a resident housekeeper would be required tolook after the place and govern the servants. Mr. Bragg hoped that Mrs.Bransby would do him the favour to accept this post, and that she wouldfind herself more comfortable among her old friends in Oldchester, thanin the wilderness of London. Moreover, he enclosed a cheque for ahandsome sum of money, as to the disposal of which he thus wrote:--"The cheque I would ask Mr. Rivers to apply to paying young MartinBransby's school fees for the ensuing year. And any little matter thatmay be over can be used for the boy's books, and so on. He is a fineboy, I think, and worth helping. Learning is a great thing. I never hadit myself, but I don't undervalue it for that. I have thought that thiswould perhaps be the best way I could find of what you might calltestifying my appreciation of Mr. Rivers's services to me. I hope hewill accept it as a wedding present."To May he sent no gift."I could offer her nothing but dross," he wrote, "and I don't want herthoughts of me to be mixed up with gold and diamonds, and such poorthings as are oftentimes the best a rich man has to give. Some youngladies would be disappointed at this. I don't believe she will. Whenshe's dressed and ready to go to church, just you please kiss herforehead with a blessing in your mind, and--you needn't say anything toher, but just say to yourself, 'this is from Joshua Bragg.'"Of the wedding, it may be said that, although it was no doubt in manyrespects like other weddings, yet in several it was peculiar. And itspeculiarities were in such flagrant violation of the regulations ofsociety, that it was almost providential Mrs. Dormer-Smith escapedwitnessing it.In the first place, although Uncle Frederick was present, a welcome andan honoured guest, May insisted that Mr. Weatherhead should give heraway. And, perhaps, nothing she had ever done in her life had causedGranny more heartfelt satisfaction. As to "Uncle Jo," the honour nearlyoverpowered him. His appearance in wedding garments, with an enormouswhite waistcoat, and a bright rose-coloured tie, was an abiding joy toall the little boys of the neighbourhood who were lucky enough to beholdhim.Then the Miss Pipers fluttered into the church in such extremely bridalattire, with long white veils attached to their bonnets, as utterly toeclipse May, in her quiet travelling dress. May, however, wore twoornaments of considerable value: a pearl bracelet and brooch, which hadarrived the previous evening. Inside each morocco case had been found aslip of paper bearing respectively the inscriptions:--"To MirandaCheffington, with the good wishes of her great-uncle;" and "To dear May,with the love of her affectionate friend, Constance Castlecombe."Lastly, Amelia Simpson was so florid in her raiment, and so exuberant inher delight, as to be the observed of all observers. In her excitement,she backed heavily upon people behind her, and trod upon the gowns ofpeople before her; knelt down at the wrong moment, and then, discoveringher mistake, jumped up again at the very instant when the rest of thecongregation were sinking on to their knees; dropped her metal-claspedprayer-book with a crash in a solemn pause of silence; lost herpocket-handkerchief, and, in her near-sightedness and confusion, seizedon Miss Polly Piper's long white veil to wipe her tear-dimmedspectacles; and was, altogether, a severe trial to the nerves of theofficiating clergyman.Many other friends were there. Major Mitton, with his amiable face, anderect, soldierly figure; Dr. Hatch, who said he doubted whether he couldsnatch a moment to witness the ceremony, but who remained to the verylast, to wish the young couple God speed! when they drove away from thedoor of the church on their honeymoon trip. Even Sebastian Bach Simpsonwas in a softened mood. The entire absence of pretension about the wholeaffair conciliated his good will; and he played Mendelssohns' "WeddingMarch" as a voluntary, when the bride and bridegroom walked down thechurch arm-in-arm, with unusual spirit and heartiness. And so May andOwen began their voyage of life together, followed by many good wishes,and by less of envy, hatred, malice, and uncharitableness, than perhapsfall to the lot of most mortals.       *       *       *       *       *Marriage, which is the end of most story-books, is but the beginning ofmany stories; but this chronicle cannot follow the personages who havefigured in it much beyond that fateful chapter of the wedding-day.One or two facts may, however, be told, and a few outlines sketched in,to indicate the course of future events on a more or less distanthorizon.For a long time Pauline clung, with the soft pertinacity which was partof her character, to the hope that "poor dear Augustus" might yetinherit the Castlecombe acres, and resume his place in society. UncleGeorge could not live for ever! But one fine day the bells of Combe St.Mildred's rang a merry peal, and the news spread like wildfire throughthe village that an heir was born in a foreign city called Naples; andthat my lord and my lady--who was doing extremely well--and theall-important baby were coming home to Combe Park as soon as ever mylady was strong enough to travel.Then, indeed, Pauline felt that Providence had decided against herbrother, and that her own duty to society lay plain and clear beforeher.During the following year or two she suffered considerable persecutionin the shape of appeals for money from Augustus. The first were in ahaughty strain, but before long they sank into the whine of the regularbegging-letter writer. She gave him what she could, for to the last shehad a soft place in her heart for her brother. But her husband, findingthe case hopeless, forbade her to give any more, and, as far as hecould, prevented Augustus's letters from reaching her.Captain Cheffington then brought his wife to London. He had little fearof his creditors, having by this time sunk so low as not to be worthpowder and shot. He got his wife engaged, under her real name, at amusic-hall of the third class, and caused paragraphs to be inserted insundry sporting and theatrical prints to the effect that "the Mrs.Augustus Cheffington, whose Italian bravura-singing was so successful afeature in the nightly entertainment," etc., etc., was the niece bymarriage of a peer of the realm--Viscount Castlecombe of Combe Park; andhe furnished his relations liberally with copies of these papers.Probably he had some hope that they would buy him off to save the honourof the family, but in this he was totally at fault. The old lord who, inthe joy of his little son's birth seemed to have taken a new lease oflife, merely chuckled at "Gus's making such a confounded ass ofhimself," and cared not a snap of the fingers for anything he could sayor do.Owen Rivers privately supplied his father-in-law with all thenecessaries, and some of the comforts, of life, on condition that he wasnever to annoy May by making any kind of appeal to her; on the firstinfringement of this condition the supplies would be withdrawn. And inorder to secure its not being all lost at the gaming-table, Owen paidthe money into the hands of La Bianca, who, according to her lights, wasby no means a bad wife, and was certainly a much better one than herselfish and graceless husband deserved.Mrs. Bransby gratefully accepted the position offered to her, andfulfilled its duties entirely to Mr. Bragg's satisfaction. Indeed, whenthe latter returned from Buenos Ayres, he took the habit of spending agood deal of time in the apartment reserved for him over the office. Thehouse--one of the roomy, old-fashioned mansions in Friar'sRow--contained ample accommodation for Mrs. Bransby's family. Miss Enidcompleted, and maintained, her conquest of Mr. Bragg; and some personsthought that it was this young lady's personal attractions which causedhim to spend so much of his time in Friar's Row; but other observersthought differently. And, indeed, quite latterly, Mrs. Dormer-Smith hashad her ill-opinion of Mrs. Bransby strengthened by certain rumourstouching the likelihood of that lady's promotion to a higher position inMr. Bragg's household than that of paid housekeeper."If _that_ should ever come off," says Mrs. Dormer-Smith, "I supposepoor dear foolish May's eyes will be opened at last; and she may repentwhen it is too late having thrown away her magnificent opportunity, tobe picked up by that _designing_ woman."When these mysterious forecasts are imparted to Lady Castlecombe, sheonly smiles faintly, and says in her quiet, well-bred way, "Well, butwhy not?" My lady has her own views on the subject--views in which thediscomfiture and mortification of Theodore Bransby form a conspicuousand pleasing feature. But hitherto nothing has happened to justify theprevisions of either lady on this score.Theodore is not often seen in Oldchester now. The place is full ofdisagreeable associations for him. His political candidature was afailure: the Castlecombe influence on his behalf having been suddenlywithdrawn after his lordship's marriage--greatly to the perplexity ofhis lordship's agent!Nevertheless, Mr. Theodore Bransby by no means despairs of being able towrite M.P. after his name at some future time. But if he ever does enterParliament, it will probably be on what our Continental neighbours term"the extreme Left of the Chamber." For Theodore's political opinionshave undergone a great revulsion, and he is now loftily contemptuous ofthe territorial aristocracy. In fact, he has been heard to supportadvanced theories of an almost Communistic complexion--stopping short,however, at the confiscation of other people's property, and maintainingthe inviolability of Government Stock, of which he is a large holder.This sort of theory he finds to be quite compatible with the pursuit offashionable society.Although surrounded by every luxury which can minister to his personalcomfort, he is not at all extravagant, and, indeed, saves more than halfhis annual income. This he does, not from positive avarice, but becausehe feels ever more and more strongly that money is power. Moreover, itwill be well to have a handsome sum in hand whenever he marries: for heis still firmly minded to find a wife who will devote herself to takingcare of him. Quite recently a paragraph has appeared in the Oldchesternewspaper announcing the probability of a marriage between "ourdistinguished townsman, Mr. Theodore Bransby, whose career at the Bar isbeing watched with pride and pleasure in his native city, and the LadyEuphemia Haggistown, daughter of the Earl of Cauldkail, etc., etc.,etc."Lady Euphemia is a faded, timid, gentlewoman of some five orsix-and-thirty years of age, with neither money nor beauty. She issometimes haunted by the ghost of a romantic attachment to a pennilessyoung navy officer lost at sea hard upon twenty years ago. But she has asoft, submissive desire to win the kindly regard of the remarkably stiffand cold young gentleman whom her father has decided she is to marrywhenever he shall see fit to ask her. But poor Lady Effie does notsucceed in softening the implacable correctness of her suitor'sdemeanour into anything very humanly sympathetic. Theodore is quitecertain to make the most of his wife's title and social standing indealing with the world in general, but it is to be feared that he maythink fit to balance matters by tyrannizing over her in private withsome rigour.Mrs. Dormer-Smith often moralizes her family history, entangling herselfin many metaphysical knots in the course of her cogitations as to whatwould have happened if something else had happened which never didhappen!Of course, if poor dear Augustus had not thrown himself away on SusanDobbs things would have been very different. But even in spite of that,much might have been retrieved had he not made a second and still moreshocking _mesalliance_ with a strolling Italian singer; because,probably, if Augustus had come home after the death of his cousin Luciusin a proper spirit, and under not discreditable circumstances, and hadconducted himself so as to conciliate his uncle, the old man would neverhave thought of marrying again. Constance Hadlow would never have becomeViscountess Castlecombe, and no heir would have appeared to thrustAugustus from his inheritance.There was an ever-recurring difficulty in fixing the exact point atwhich "poor dear Augustus's misfortunes" had become irretrievable. Sothat, although Pauline was on perfectly civil terms with theCastlecombes, and although Frederick was asked down to Combe Park forthe shooting every season, and although my lady was happy to receive theDormer-Smiths (with the least little indefinable touch of condescension)whenever she was at her house in town; yet, in her confidential moments,Pauline's intimate friends were never quite sure to which of the threemomentous alliances she was alluding, when she talked plaintively of"That Unfortunate Marriage."THE END.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of That Unfortunate Marriage, Vol. 3(of 3), byFrances Eleanor Trollope*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THAT UNFORTUNATE MARRIAGE ******** This file should be named 35945.txt or 35945.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/5/9/4/35945/Produced by Delphine Lettau, Mary Meehan and the OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.netUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

He is enabled to see "thewheels go round;" has the chance of getting his knowledge at firsthand. In stirring times the drama of life is to him like the firstnight of a play. There are no preconceived opinions for him to go by;he ought not to, at least, be influenced by any prejudices; and theaccount of the performance is to some extent like that of the dramaticcritic, inasmuch as that the verdict of the public or of history haseither to confirm or reverse his own judgment. There is a peculiarand unique fascination about this reading of contemporary history, asit grows and develops while one peers with straining eyes throughone's glasses. There is something like a first night, too, about theway the critics view things. Sometimes great difference of opinion. Irecollect the afternoon of Nicholson's Nek--Black Monday, as it wasafterwards called--when we returned into Ladysmith half thecorrespondents seemed to be under the impression that the day had beenquite a successful one; while, on the other hand, one had headed hisdespatch with the words, "Dies Ir?, dies illa!" To get to the heart ofthings; to see the upspringing of the streams of active and strenuouslife; to watch the great struggles of the world, not always thegreatest in war, but the often more mighty, if quiet and dead silent,whose sweeping powerfulness is hidden under a smooth calmness ofsurface--to watch all this is to intimately taste a great deliciousjoy of life. The researches of the historian of bygone times arefascinating--absorbingly fascinating, although he is alwayshandicapped by remoteness; but the historian of to-day--of hisday--this day--whose day-page of history is read by hundreds ofreaders, the day after has set to him a task that calls for all, andmore than all, that he can give--stimulates while it appalls, andwould be killingly wearying if it were not so fascinatinglyattractive. That close contact with the men of this struggling world,and the men who _do_ things, and shove these life-wheels round, warmsup in one a great love for one's kind--a comrade feeling, like thatwhich comes from being tent-mates in a long campaign. Two o'clock inthe morning wake to the tramp, tramp of men marching in thedark--marching out to fight--and the unknown Tommy you march besideand talk to in low voice, as men talk at that hour, is your comradeunto the day's end of fighting; when returning, to the sentries'challenge you answer "A friend," and, dog-tired, you re-enter thelines, welcomed by his sesame call, "Pass, friend; all is well."IMPRESSIONS OF A WAR CORRESPONDENTITHE DANCE OF DEATHDeath from a Mauser bullet is less painful than the drawing of atooth. Such, at least, appears to be the case, speaking generally fromapparent evidence, without having the opportunity of collecting theopinions of those who have actually died. In books we have read ofshrieks of expiring agony; but ask those who have been on manybattlefields, and they will not tell you they have heard them. As arule a sudden exclamation, "I'm hit!" "My God!" "Damn it!" They lookas if staggering from the blow of a fist rather than that from a tinypencil of lead--then a sudden paleness, perhaps a grasping of thehands occasionally as if to hold on to something, when the bottomseems to be falling out of all things stable, but generally no sign ofaught else than the dulling of death--dulling to sleep--a drunkensleep--drunken death it often seems--very commonplace as a rule. Asmile as often as, or oftener than, any sign of pain, but generally nosign of either. Think of this, mourning mothers of England. Don'tpicture your sons as drowning out of the world racked with the redtorture from the bullet's track, but just as dropping off dully tosleep, most probably with no thought of you or home, without anxietyor regret. Merciful Mauser! He suffered much more pain when youbrought him long ago to the dentist, and his agony in that horriblechair was infinitely greater than on his bed on the veldt. MercifulMauser be thanked!The first man I saw badly hit during the war was a Devon atElandslaagte, just after they had advanced within rifle-range. He wasshot through the head, and it seemed quite useless for the bearers totake the trouble of carrying him off the field; yet they went backlooking in vain for a field ambulance. They carried him instead to thecart belonging to a well-known war correspondent. The owner had giventhe driver strict orders to remain where he was until his return, butthe shells were falling around the cart, which, in fact, seemed to bemade a mark of by the Boer gunners--perhaps they thought it belongedto one of our generals, whom they may have imagined had taken todriving, like Joubert and some others of theirs. The arrival of thewounded man was a great godsend to the driver, who immediately, withthe most humane insistence, offered to drive him to the nearest fieldhospital. Neither cart nor driver was again seen until long after thebattle was over, about nine o'clock in the evening. Strange to say,the man recovered from his wound.In our first engagements there was rather too much anxiety on the partof a wounded man's comrades to carry him to the rear; but it did notcontinue for long. The actuating motive is not always kindness andhumanity, but a desire to get out of danger. It was soon evident thatit was only going from the frying-pan into the fire, as the danger ofwalking back carrying a wounded man was immensely greater thanremaining or advancing more or less on one's stomach. Sometimes it wasthe unfortunate wounded man who was hit again. Men carrying off awounded comrade of course render themselves strictly liable to beregarded as combatants.A still more absurd practice was that of sometimes attempting to carryoff the dead during an engagement. An instance of this was seen atRietfontein. A couple of men of a Volunteer regiment were comingacross the open ground below the hill under a pretty brisk fire, whenDr. H----, himself one of the most fearless of men, called out tothem, "S---- has been killed down there; better bring him in." Theyturned back immediately, and one of them, J. Gillespie, got off hishorse and lifted the corpse on to the saddle, they holding it inposition by hanging on to a leg on either side, and walked back, whilethe bullets were whistling around them, and knocking up little spurtsof dirt on the ground in front of them. It was a most ghastly sight;the head of the corpse bobbed about with the motion of the horse, andthe lips of the corpse were drawn back in a horrible grin, as if hewere laughing idiotically at them for trying to qualify for a VictoriaCross with a corpse. I really think they deserved it just as much asif he had been alive.A curious thing happened to a horse of one of the men who wereperforming this feat. The owner found when he had returned toLadysmith that his water-bottle, which was attached to his saddle, hadbeen perforated by a bullet. Showing it to another in the evening,they came to the conclusion, from the position of the holes, that itwould be impossible for the holes to be made in the position theywere without wounding the horse. The next day, on examining the horse,he found a bullet had actually passed through and through him, and yetapparently he seemed none the worse.There was another but different instance of a horse carrying a corpseat the battle of Lombard's Kop. There was no leering and hideousgrinning at us, however, as the rider's head had been blown clean awayby a Boer shell. The 5th Lancers were riding out on our right, when asingle horse came galloping past them, clattering furiously over thestony veldt. No wonder the men stared; it was a sight to beremembered. The rider was firmly fixed in the deep cavalry saddle; thereins tossed loose with the horse's mane, and both hands were clenchedagainst either side of his breast; and the head was cut off clean atthe shoulders. Perhaps in the spasm of that death-tear the rider hadgripped his horse's sides with his long-spurred heels; perhaps thehorse also was wounded; anyhow, with head down, and wild and terrifiedeyes, his shoulders foam-bespewed, he tore past as if in horror ofthe ghastly burden he carried.How wonderfully expressive are the eyes of these cavalry horses attimes! There it seemed sheer horror; but often when wounded they looktowards one with a world of pitiful appeal for relief; in theirdumbness loud-voicedly reproachful against the horrors of war.Two men being killed on one horse seems rather a tall order, yet it isperfectly true. It happened at the cavalry charge after Elandslaagte.Some of the Boers stood their ground with great stubbornness till ourcavalry were only a few yards away. One middle-aged, bearded fellowstayed just a little too long, and had not time to get to his horse,which was a few yards away. He scrambled up behind a brother Boer whowas just mounting, but almost immediately the 5th Lancers were uponthem. There was a farrier-corporal, an immensely big, powerful fellow,who singled them out. They were galloping down a slight incline ashard as they could get their horse to travel, but their pursuer wasgaining on them at every stride. When he came within striking distancehe jammed his spurs into his big horse, who sprang forward like atiger. Weight of man and horse, impetus of gallop and hill, focused inthat bright lance-point held as in a vice. It pierced the left side ofthe back of the man behind, and the point came out through the rightside of the man in front, who, with a convulsive movement, threw uphis hands, flinging his rifle in the air. The Lancer could notwithdraw his lance as the men swayed and dropped from their horse, butgalloped on into the gathering darkness punctured with rifle flasheshere and there and flitting forms that might be friend or foe. Thispoor fellow was killed a few days after at the battle of Rietfontein.How heartily the Boers hated these Lancers! They would have liked somuch to have had lances barred as against the rules of war; and itwould certainly have made an immense difference if our side hadsucceeded in getting a few more chances, especially at thecommencement of the war, of using the lance.The natives, numbers of whom were looking on at this battle, weregreatly delighted with the cavalry charge. It seemed to take theirfancy even more than did the artillery. "Great fight, baas--plentymuch blood, plenty much blood," one of them described it. He said hewas crouching down behind a sheltering rock while the Boers wererunning away past him, and then "the men with the assegais" camegalloping after them. A Boer without his horse came running along,and, pulling him out, took his place behind the stone. A soldiergalloped along and called out, "Hallo, Johnny, what are you doinghere? You'll get hurt." Then, catching sight of the Boer, he stuck himdown through the back as he passed. "Ah, baas, great fight--plentymuch blood."Wounds or death by Mauser bullets, or even by the thrust of a lance,are not to be compared, from the point of view of theirpain-inflicting possibilities, with what may be done in that way bythe fragment of a shell. That's the thing that hurts. Shell fire,speaking generally, is the "Bogy of Battle" to those not accustomed toit. The main purpose it accomplishes is to "establish a funk." Whenthe actual damage done by shell fire after a battle is counted up andthe number of shells fired, the results are most surprising. A poet inthe _Ladysmith Lyre_ wrote--  "One thing is certain in this town of lies:  If Long Tom hits you on the head you dies."You do--unquestionably; but perhaps it is worse still to get a pieceof a shell somewhere else. What frightful wounds they make sometimes!what mangled butchery in their track! See some poor fellow stretchedon the operating-table, stripped for the patching or trimming whichhalf-helpless surgery can supply. Apart from head and hands, which aresure to be khaki-colour with dirt caked in with sweat, the averageTommy usually presents a fine specimen of the human form divine--whatis there finer in the world than the body of a well-shaped, muscularman? I always prefer the figure of the fighting gladiator to that ofthe Apollo Belvedere--and then, when shell fragments tear this body,it looks like some unspeakably unhallowed sacrilege. The horriblyunlucky way these fragments seem to go in--an uncouth and butcheringway instead of the gentlemanly puncture of the Mauser. One afternoon ayoung fellow galloped past me in the main street of Ladysmith. He hadjust got opposite the Town Hall hospital, when a shell from Bulwanaburst right under his horse. When the cloud of dust and smoke clearedaway, we found the horse lying on the road completely disembowelled,and the poor fellow flung on to the footpath, with a long piece ofshell sticking in his side. As he was taken into the hospital he said,"This means two more Dutchmen killed." But the wound was obviouslyfatal; there was no use even in removing the piece of shell. Theclergyman came to him and spoke to him for some time, and told himthat there was no hope of recovery for him. He seemed to get tired ofhis ministrations, and asked them to "send down for my chum." Whenthis chum arrived he was unable to speak, but just pressed his handand smiled, and went off into his death-sleep.A boy, who could not have been more than seventeen or eighteen, waslying on the side of the hill with his head on a flat stone. He hadbeen hit by a piece of shell, and both his legs were broken andmangled above the knee. He was done for, and his life was only amatter of lasting some minutes. Another man, wounded somewhereinternally, was lying beside him. There was no sign of pain on theboy's face; his eyes were closed. He just seemed very tired. Openinghis eyes, he looked downwards intently at his legs, which were lyingat an oblique angle with his body, from where they had been hit. Itlooked as if his trousers were the only attachment. As he gazedintently, a troubled look came over his face, and his wounded comradebeside him was watching him and saw it. The tired eyes closed againwearily, and then the wounded man alongside him, cursing withvariegated and rich vocabulary, bent, or half rolled over, and caughtfirst one boot and then the other, and lifted each leg straight down,swearing under his breath the while. Then he lay back, swearing at theblankety blank young blanker, and still watching him. Soon the tiredeyes opened again, and instinctively looked down at his legs. Theyseemed to open wider as he looked; then he smiled faintly, thinking hehad been mistaken about them before, and lay back, and the eyes didnot open any more. The fellow beside him chuckled and said to himself,"Well, I'm damned!" but possibly the Recording Angel has put down amark that may help to prevent it.Times are changed from ages past; there is no longer the mighty "shockof arms," the pomp and panoply of glorious war. Men fall to the shrillwhisper of a bullet, the sound of which has not time to reach theirears, fired by an invisible foe. Their death is merely the _quod eratdemonstrandum_ of a mathematical and mechanical proposition. But withbow and arrow, spear or battle-axe, Mauser or Lee-Metford, the heartbehind the weapon is just the same now as then. Probably faint heartsfail now as then, just as much--shrink to a panic that falls on themsuddenly as cold mist on mountain-top; and the stout hearts wait andendure, and perhaps do more of the waiting, and have to sweat andswear and endure this waiting longer now than then before theintoxicating delight of active battle finds vent for their hearts'desire, when, under names like "duty," a monarch's voice in theirsouls cries "Havoc," and lets slip the old dogs of savagery lying lowin every man's nature, until the veldt of this new land is manured,like the juicy battlefields of old, "with carrion men groaning forburial."IITHE AFTERMATH OF WARHot, sweating, dusty, and tired, with no inclination whatever to moveout of camp, everybody would find all the indications of approachingdisease every day if he were only to think of such a thing. Thereading of a liver advertisement in one of the home papers would showall your symptoms, only they all would be "more so." But every oneknew it was only the climate, the hard work, and sometimes theindifferent food, and so went on; but a day comes when the foodbecomes absolutely distasteful, when the appetite begins to go. A longday's riding on the veldt should leave one with a voracious appetitefor dinner, but when one comes in and can taste nothing, and onlyjust lies down dog-tired day after day, then he begins to think thereis something wrong. The idea of going to the doctor is verydistasteful, so he struggles on, hoping to work it off, until one dayhe comes very near a collapse, with head swimming and knees groggy,and then some comrade makes the doctor have a look at him, and histemperature is perhaps 102 to 104. In Ladysmith it was then a questionof being sent out to Intombi Camp. To most men this seemed like beingexiled to Siberia; but there was no help for it. Comrades saidgood-bye when it would have been more cheering to have said _aurevoir_. The train left for Intombi Hospital Camp at six in themorning, carrying its load of those who had been wounded in theprevious twenty-four hours, as well as the sick. It was a sad journeyout; men could not help cursing their bad luck and wondering whatwould be before them as a result of the journey, wondering if theyshould ever rejoin their regiments or if their next journey would notbe back to the cemetery they were now passing on their right, growingevery day more ominously populous. The hospital camp at Intombi was acollection of tents and large marquees, civilian doctors attending theVolunteers and Army doctors the Regulars. There was also aconsiderable number of the inhabitants of Ladysmith, not alone womenand children, but men. Hence the reason that it got christened CampFunk by the inhabitants that remained in the town. Situated on theflat of the plain, on a level with the river banks, it was by no meansan ideal situation for a fever hospital, but still it was a greatthing to be out of the way of these irregularly dropping shells and to_know_ one was away from them. "Long Tom," on Bulwana, shook the veryground when he fired, and, with the other guns there, often got on thenerves of many of the patients to a trying extent, and the Boers, as arule, started firing at sunrise, just about the time when the poordevil who has tossed and turned through the long hours of the hotnight in fevered restlessness now from sheer exhaustion is justsinking into sleep, to be startled by the terrific bang above his headand the rush of the shell, like the tearing of a yacht's mainsail, asit speeds on its arched course towards the devoted town.A curious passive fight the patient settles down to, with a fatallittle thermometer keeping score and marking the game--a sort oftug-of-war between doctors and Disease. The ground is marked indegrees from 98.4 to 106, the former being normal temperature, thelater the point at which, as a rule, disease wins the game.Take the case of a fellow the author knows intimately. He had held outtoo long without going to hospital, putting down his weakness,lassitude, and general feeling of extreme cheapness to the climateinstead of the real cause, with the result that he started on the realstruggle with a temperature of 104.8. At the very start Disease hadpulled him over nastily close to his line, and was still pulling himover, as his temperature was rising point by point. There are variousmethods of treatment--with him they fought it with a drug calledphenacetin, and to the lay mind a wonderful drug it appears. It is noteffective with every one. A man in the next bed to him might have beentaking breadcrumbs for all effect it produced. With him, however, itworked like clockwork. No sooner was a five-grain dose swallowed thanthe temperature stopped in its upward course. Then, gradually, like ina good Turkish bath, the pores of his skin opened, and a most completeand profuse perspiration ensued, which was allowed to go on for acouple of hours. Then, with bed and bedclothes drenched, he lay weak,limp, and feeling like a squeezed sponge, but with a temperature thatshows three degrees marked down towards his own line. Should there bea nurse available the patient is washed down and put into freshclothes and pyjamas; if not, as was most usually the case, he lies inhis sweat, his skin chilling in patches for a while, and feelingsticky and uncomfortable all over, but too limp to move. The drug hasa strange and wonderfully clearing effect on the brain. He feels as ifall his previous life had been passed in some land of twilight. Now helives in a land of glorious light--light that pervades everything. Hiseyelids are closed to shut in the glorious light. He seems to havebeen sitting in some dark theatre when the lights have been turned onon a glorious transformation scene. He has circled the world and seenits loveliest places, but only now sees how beautiful they were. InSamoa, and the Pali at Honolulu, he sees the individual leavesshimmering in the clear air, and then on his quickened consciousnessfalls a great sense of the beauty of the world. Separate from thebeauty of the world seems the life on it, and now for the first timehis lips are pressed to her bluest veins. "I want to take yourtemperature, please," as he feels the little glass tube at the dryskin of his lips. "105.2," he hears whispered when it is withdrawn.They think he cannot hear as he lies motionless with eyes closed. Allthe three degrees have been lost, and more--it is a score for Disease.Another dose of phenacetin--surely all that glorious, untravelled,half-tasted world is too beautiful and rich with promise to leave, toofull of music he has not heard, too full of pictures he has not seen,too full of unplucked laurels, of lips unkissed, of sunsets which havenot yet painted the clouds in their setting--above all, along thepassed path of his life are neglected flowers of love lying which hehas walked on with scarce a smile of thanks for the throwers, whosehands, perchance now withering, he longs to kiss.Temporarily the thermometer score is favourable to him again, but allhe can do is to lie very still, knowing that every feather-pressure ofstrength will be wanted. Lying sideways, as he has been shifted roundby his nurse on the pillow, he hears the pump, pump of his heart. Henever noted that pumping before as he does now--quick and strenuousit is, but still strong, without the spur of stimulants. Pump on, oldheart, he thought-speaks, and on it pumps through the long hours ofwatching and waiting; and he watches as a captain might watch thepumping of his water-logged ship. He is lucky to have a heart thatworks like that. The man beside him was being given brandy every threehours to help the action of his heart. Another thing he was lucky inwas in being free from headache. A sufferer farther down from time totime called aloud in agony from the terrible splitting pains in hishead, while his was clear to a supersensitive degree--too clear andactive to allow of sleep--and soon came the time when he longed with agreat yearning for the sleep that would not come. It seemed cruel andunfair that any beggar, any coolie in the fields, any convict couldhave this sleep that was denied him. How he tried to fix his mind onquiet scenes with the sound of falling water, or the sound of fallingbreakers fringing the rocks of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn!But sleep would not come; the panorama of the world spun from scene toscene all the faster as he tossed limply and wearily. _Custos, quid denocte?_ How slowly passes the night, and night sleepless merges intosleepless day, and for a week the struggle hangs on the winning lineof Disease. Each time the thermometer is drawn from his mouth an evernew-born hope which has risen dies with the whispered score, but stillthe heart pumps strenuously, telling of life and hope the while. Onthe morning of the sixth day the score is down a degree. Too good tobelieve in until confirmed by the midday record, and then very, veryslowly, by fractions of degrees, it shows less than the record of theprevious days. In the cool quietude of some Continental sculpturegallery--he cannot tell where--he has seen a statue of Icarus--Icarusjust feeling the earth-spurning power of his new-given wings; Icaruson tip-toe, with head up and godly-moulded chest and dilated nostrils,drinking in the clear air, and extended arms towards his newpossession of the clouds. The glorious embodiment of god-like life,earth-spurning, heavens-enjoying--and as such he feels--he forgetsthat his frame is a skin-covered skeleton, that his legs would notbear him upright. He knows only that the spirit of life has beenbreathed into him again, and that it is very good to be alive. Thefeeling of being "half in love with easeful death" has passed. Theorchestra of life will play for him again. How irksomely slow the dayspass until the score reaches his winning-line of normal! and in timehe sees how easily it might have been otherwise. His room-mate on hisright got delirious, and refused all nourishment. He struggledviolently even against the stimulants prescribed for him. His nursewould spend half an hour trying to get a little down. Then he had seenan extreme attempt made to feed him one night. He was held while atube was passed through the back of his nose and so down his throat,but no sooner was it down than the strength of fever, like that of amaniac, proved too strong for his nurses; they could no longer holdhim. There was a horrible struggle, with choking coughs and dark bloodflowing from his nostrils, and the brandy was spilt on his face andsmarting in his eyes. He spent days dying, and more rapid and morefeeble grew his pulse, and many times the nurse said there was noneperceptible, and then the life would flicker up again. One morningearly a bugle sounded outside. He said, "I am on outpost duty to-day;I must get up at once." He half lifted himself in the bed, repeating,"I tell you I am on outpost duty." The nurse pressed him back gently,and he died. He seemed to have no friends or relatives, no one whoknew anything about him. There was a letter found in his pocketshowing that he had a mother in a village in Ireland, and that he washer only son.On the other side of our friend was a poor fellow unceasingly rackedwith pain either in head or abdomen. His temperature was notextremely high, but he seemed to be falling away from the pain of thepoisonous disease. His pulse was weak, and had to be kept going withconstant stimulants. When in the ordinary course of things the diseaseshould have passed he got a series of rigors and shivering fits aboutevery third day, with a cold sweat. While the shivering was on him histemperature would drop to normal or lower, and then bound up to 103 or104. He had a terrible dread of these fits, and it was pitiful to seehim watching their oncoming. Each one that came left him weaker as itpassed off.We are coming back to England in a ship laden with the human wreckageof war--the wounded, the maimed, the sick, who to their graves willcarry the maiming of their sickness. There are, amongst these men,those who will crawl about the world lop-sided, incomplete cripples,or those who will be perpetually victims to intermittent or chronicdisease; but there is a worse than any of these disasters to thevictim. The man without a leg can get along with a crutch. We know onewho lost both legs in Egypt who goes about on a little four-wheeledwooden cart, propelling himself with his hands, and haunts theprecincts of a certain club, where the members, seeing the badge whichhe still wears in his cap, often give him enough to get drunk on. Theman who loses his sight from the earth-scattering shell can at worstcarry a label to tell that he was blinded in the war, and hischaritable fellow-countrymen will give him enough to keep him enjoyinglife through the channels of the four other senses, and he will stilladmit that it is good to be alive. Blindness is bad, but war dealsworse blows than in the eyes. It deals blows under which the reasonitself staggers and is maimed. The lunatic asylum is worse than thehospital. We are carrying back nine men who have lost their reason atMagersfontein and other battles; two have been mercifully treated andhave lost it completely--the padded cell must mean a certainunconsciousness; but the greatest, deepest pity of which the humanheart is capable is called forth by those who are maimed in mind. Longlucid intervals of perfect sanity give them time to learn the meaningof the locks and bars. "Yes, I know; I went off my head afterMagersfontein," one poor fellow tells you; another repeatedly asks,"Will they put me into an asylum when I go home?" What a home-coming!Sure enough it is to the asylum they are going. They will be lost towhat friends or relatives they have in that oblivion of a livinggrave. When their comrades return, not the faintest echo of thecheering will reach their cells. Men do not like to talk of madness;they will point with pride and pity to chums and comrades bearinghonourable wounds, but these poor wretches will just disappear, lostin the great aftermath of war. We still have the expressions"frightened out of his senses" or "frightened out of his wits," andhere are instances of its actually occurring, the strain on nervesbeing more than the brains of these men could stand. Is it that theirnervous organisation has become more highly strung and bears thestrain less sturdily than in times past, or that there is for someminds a hidden terror in the sightless, invisible death that whistlesover them as they lie belly-pressing the earth in the face of anunseeable foe? It is not inconceivable that this may have an effectlike some horrible nightmare amid all the glare of daylight on someminds. The man is held there in terror by the worse terror of runningaway; a comrade on his right grows callous by waiting, and to relievethe wants of nature raises himself up and gets hit; the thirst ofanother overcomes him, and he runs to fill his water-bottle and falls;and all day long, through heat and hunger and thirst, he is held therein a vice of increasing terror, like a child left in the dark deniedthe language of a cry. It takes strong nerves to stand that strain, weall must admit who have any personal knowledge of what it means; andwhat a gathering up of the reins of self-control we often experience!What wonder, then, that weak nerves cannot stand it, but sometimesbreak down under the strain? Such a collapse has a way of beingregarded as the uttermost sign of abject cowardice, which by no meansfollows--nervous men are frequently the bravest of the brave. Therefinement of modern shooting-irons seems to call for a certaincorresponding refinement of courage--the cold, steel-like courage thatcan stand and wait, and win by the waiting of their stand.IIIELANDSLAAGTEUp before daybreak, but still not early enough, as the Imperial LightHorse and a battery of Natal Artillery had already gone towardsElandslaagte, about sixteen miles from here, at three o'clock.It was bitterly cold when we started, and for a couple of hours of ourjourney. About half a mile beyond Modder's Spruit Station we met a manwalking along the road in his socks, carrying a pair of heavy boots.He told us he had just escaped from the Boers, after having been, withthirty other miners, their prisoner since Thursday last. His feet weresore from running in the big boots, and he was nearly exhausted.The Boers had looted the stores, station, and mining office atElandslaagte, and in addition had looted a lot of luggage taken inthe captured train. The evening before he had seen a drunken Boerstrutting about dressed in a suit of evening clothes belonging to anEnglish officer. There were a lot of low-class Boers amongst the eighthundred there who spent riotous evenings, getting drunk on the liquorfound in the stores; but others of them seemed decent sort of farmers,and all the prisoners were very well treated by General Koch, and wereallowed to go about on parole, being merely required to reportthemselves once a day.[Illustration: Bringing Wounded Back Into Ladysmith.]We pushed on, and in the distance could hear the report of cannon. Wesoon discovered a little artillery duel in progress between the Natalbattery and the Boer guns. The Natals were barking away pluckily, butquite ineffectually against their very superior opponents, who weremaking really excellent practice, and they struck an artillery waggon,blowing it to pieces, and missed the artillery train by barely twentyyards, a shell falling on either side of it. It was clear we couldremain here no longer, so the order was given to retire. The gunslimbered up, leaving the shattered wreck of the waggon behind, and thetrains commenced to move back slowly, keeping pace with the cavalryand artillery. The Boer guns kept firing until out of range, and thenthere was a desultory pitter-patter of rifle fire at a sufficientdistance to be completely ineffectual.We retired back just behind Modder's Spruit Station and rested there.The sun had now broken through the clouds and poured down hot on theyellow veldt, where we were. A beautiful scene stretched away beforeus. The veldt was not all yellow, but in low-lying places, after therecent rain, was beginning to be streaked with vivid green. Oppositeus, across the flat or gently undulating veldt in the middle distance,were hills and kopjes, while beyond, purple under clouds or light bluein sunshine, rose to the far horizon mountains, pointed, or of thatquite flat-topped shape so characteristic of this country.No one who has been through this day can ever forget the beautifulseries of military tableaux, the gorgeous colouring, the constantlyvarying effects of light and shade, under clear, blue sky, or whenpiles of great white cumuli were passing, until, darkening with theprogress of the fight, an unnatural gloom blackened the heavens, andfrom the inky clouds torrents of rain poured upon the combatants. Thevariety of colour, light, and shade was only equalled by the variety ofthe military movements during the day. A complete series of sketches orphotographs would serve for illustrations for a handbook of moderntactics--the reconnaissance in force in the morning--engagement--orderlyretreat carried out exactly according to book--march out of main body;advance of main body, cavalry on each flank, skirmishing outflankingmovement on the right, etc., etc., on to the cavalry charging throughand through retreating and beaten enemy.At 11.20 two squadrons of cavalry and a battery of artillery arrive,and shortly after another train full of troops is seen approaching inthe distance.Chatting with Colonel Chisholme, of the Imperial Light Horse, I waschaffing him about calling them "light," pointing out a group ofgiants standing near him; but he agreed that their hearts were light,anyhow, whatever their weight might be. He had commenced his militarycareer when eighteen in the 9th Lancers, and his Imperial Light Horsewas embodied on the 9, 9, 99. He was telling how all the importantdates of his life had a 9 in them, as Major Douglas Haig galloped upand told him we were going to start. I said, "All these nines clearlypoint to your living to ninety-nine." "Oh no," he laughed back,cheerily, "I don't wish to live to be as old as that." His wish wasgratified."Saddle," "Prepare to mount," "Mount." We were going forward again.At 1.30 we started, after just two hours' rest, in which the main bodyhad come up, so that our entire force now consisted of the 5thLancers, Imperial Light Horse, two field batteries of RoyalArtillery, the Devonshire Regiment, half a battalion of theManchester, and half a battalion of the Gordon Highlanders. At 1.55fire opened from the tops of the line of ridges running parallel tothe railway line, which were all lined with men. Some of the 5thLancers have already gone off to the extreme right. At the foot of thefirst hill, from which firing proceeds, a squadron of the BorderMounted Rifles are dismounting, and now two lines of khaki figures areclimbing steadily up the hill. Long before they reach the top theBoers are seen retiring. They have no idea of making a stand yet, andas the khaki figures reach the summit the Lancers, sweeping round fromthe extreme right flank, join them. During this time the Devons andManchesters have been pouring out of the train, and are now crossingthe veldt in dotted lines towards the ridge of hills.2.15.--Another train now appears, bringing further reinforcements.2.30.--Quite a hot fire now opens on the extreme left, and in a fewminutes the artillery are ordered forward, and the six guns pass us ata gallop. They are soon lined up and firing shrapnel at some Boers,who scurry away over the brow of a kopje. The guns limber up and jumpthe railway line--a pretty stiff little obstacle--the narrow gaugemetals being on top of a narrow embankment. Then across a level fieldof veldt, and they commence to ascend a slight depression, which isjust behind a shouldering billow of veldt. It is hard work for theartillery horses over this ground, but it is fine the way they tug andstrain at their work. The officers urge the men to hurry forward.Already a gun is heard from the Boers. They have opened fire. Twowheelers of an artillery waggon drop down, apparently dead, fromexhaustion.I had just been watching their heavy sweating sides and foam-streamingmouths before they collapsed. Already two spare horses are beingbrought round to replace them as we hurry forward.Now, all of a sudden, things become lively, and do not slacken againuntil the finish. No sooner have the first of the cavalry appearedthan the Dutch guns open fire. R-r-r-r rip--a shell drops amongst theartillery and cavalry just ahead of us. The cavalry wheel and spreadthemselves into more open order none too soon, as now the shells comefast. The Boers have got the range exactly. Bang bursts a shellamongst the Imperial Light Horse near me. A shell bursts quite close,and a piece drops between Bennett Burleigh and me. The life, vigour,and swing of movement of these few minutes when we first came underfire was magnificent, the cavalry wheeling and circling, infantrydeploying, the rattle of the artillery waggons, the cracking of thedrivers' whips on the backs of the straining, struggling horses, therending sound of the shells in the air like the tearing of a greatcanvas mainsail; the loud report when a shell exploded, or the dullthud when they simply buried themselves in the veldt.How lucky for us so few of them exploded! There would have beenterrible damage done, especially by the first few shots, when thecavalry and artillery were massed together. It was now for a while anartillery duel, but the Devons were quietly getting forward for thefront attack. The cavalry had swung out on the extreme right flank,and the Manchesters and Gordons were going on to the ridge to takethem on their right flank there, while the Devons went up the face.The Boers changed their artillery fire from time to time; first it wasat our artillery and cavalry, then into the Devons as they advanced oras they lay down in the last field of veldt, waiting for the finalcharge; and then they sent a few shells into a body of cavalry thatwas on our extreme left. The very last shot they fired was a good one,just when the fight was over, right into our guns.I saw a little rocky point ahead of me, as if made on purpose for awar correspondent. By running across some open ground I was on to it.There was good if not ample cover on the top. It was in the middle ofthe angle made by the line of advance of the men along the ridge andthe line of the Devons' main advance, and quite close to the hill.Stretching away on our left over a level khaki-coloured sloping field(if I may so call it) of veldt, were the Devons lying behindant-hills, placed as if on purpose to give scant but welcome shelterto troops advancing under fire. The colour-scheme of the whole stretchwas perfect for concealment, and there was Tommy learning more of howto take advantage of scant cover in this half-hour, under the bitterpitter-patter of Mauser bullets, than he would learn at home in yearsof manoeuvres.That was a trying wait for Mr. Atkins; yet how steadily he stoodit--or not exactly stood it, but crouched it, lay it, ormother-earth-hugged it! On our right was the level sky-lined hill,ending in a rounded, precipitous point, on which the Boer guns werestationed. Under that heavy-hanging bank of clouds, yet just behindit, a clear steel-like light was showing. Against this, upon the topof the hill, silhouetted with most delicately accurate sharpness, werethe figures of the Manchesters. The Gordons were in the same line overthe rounded top of the hill. They advanced at a run, crouched, thenswarmed forward again, and again lay low. Then the little runs becameshorter, the rests longer, and the fire hotter and more continuous.Were they going to take that hill before complete nightfall, or was itgoing to be a two-day job, notwithstanding the five hours' hardfighting we had had already? A man near me said to me, "Do you hearthe steam escaping? I expect it is the Boers letting it off from thecolliery which they took on Thursday." It was the sound of steam, ofescaping steam, right enough, but that sound was made by bullets. Itwent on continuously from the time the final infantry advance tookplace, and rose in a crescendo of hissing vehemence as we neared thesupreme climax of the struggle. How eagerly we watched these creepingfigures going forward! Would they succeed? Would they ever reach thepoint of the hill? How slow it seemed, but steadily, steadily on alongthe ridge they went.Now all the great orchestra of battle was playing--from behind us onthe right our artillery were firing at the hill in advance of theManchesters and Gordons--in one minute that I timed with my watch Icounted sixteen discharges. How the shells shrieked and whirled overus! I found myself somehow humming the "Ride of the Valkyrie," whichthese shells had suggested; then the Maxims would play a few bars, ora sharp volley ring from the left. The rocky kopje was vocal withrattling echoes, while with piccolo distinctness the air above andabout us sang with the sharp Mauser notes.It was now a quarter to six. Rapid movements could be seen amongst theBoers on top of the hill; some were beginning to gallop off, over thesky line, but others galloped in the opposite direction. Ourartillery fire had now reached a nicety of deadly accuracy. They werefiring impact shells. I had my glasses on one horseman who appeared tome to be firing from his saddle, and fighting stubbornly. There was nosign of running away about him. As I looked the figure became a littlecloud of smoke--the smoke cleared--horse nor rider was any longerthere. Chancing to look at another, who was darting about irregularly,as if confused and not knowing which way to fly, a fountain of smokeflew up in front of his horse as a shell burst. When the smoke clearedhe and the horse were lying on the ground, and immediately after to athird exactly the same thing happened.The crescendo of battle had now reached a climax in a perfect roar ofsound. The bugles sounded the charge. God bless the man that wrotethese heart-cheering notes. Forward--rattling, stumbling, falling overthe rocks, cheering, swearing, forward anyhow--formation be hanged!How the Devons climbed these rocks! Following in the right of theDevons' wake, passing their wounded across that slopy field of veldt,and the flat to the base of the hill, it was a sweating, breathlessclimb up; the men were already cheering on the top above my head. Thefirst sign of mortality on the Boer side I encountered was a hairylittle black pig lying on his side bleeding proverbially--then a tallBoer lying headlong down the rocks. On the top--what confusion! Tommy,drunk with delight of battle. Prisoners, wounded, Gordons,Manchesters, Devons--all mixed inexplicably. A Boer gun still inposition was a centre for gathering. In another place the ground wasstrewn with rugs, broken provisions, empty and half-empty bottles,saddles galore."'Av a 'oss, guv'nor, 'av a 'oss?" said a dirty-faced, sweaty, butgenerous Tommy to me, as he led a black Boer steed by the bridle. Notliking to take his capture from him, I went off to where he told meseveral were standing, and picked out a likely-looking grey. Darknesswas now rapidly falling. A Tommy came up and led off another horse."I'm taking this for the Colonel; me and the old man don't get onwell. The old buffer is always down on me whenever I takes a drop, butI'm going to make him a present of a 'oss this night, that I am." Hewent off in the darkness, towing the present by the bridle.At this moment very few officers were at this point of the hill; theGordons, for instance, had lost thirteen. I came then upon GeneralFrench, who had come along the ridge in the fighting line with theManchesters and Gordons, and was glad to have so early a chance ofoffering him my heartiest congratulations on the day. The last time Ihad met him was when the artillery on both sides were hard at it; heappeared then more like a man playing a game of chess than a game ofwar, and was not too busy to sympathise with me on the badness of thelight when he saw me trying to take snapshots of the Boer shellsbursting amongst the Imperial Light Horse near us.General French is deservedly very popular with officers, men,correspondents, and all who meet him, and we were all glad at thebrilliant ending of this hard-fought day.The 5th Lancers and 5th Dragoon Guards were now pursuing theretreating Boers. The Dragoons carried lances, which may account forthe credit which was equally due to them with the Lancers being undulygiven to the latter. Another hour or half-hour of light and they wouldhave played the very mischief with the retreating Boers. The Dragoonschased them past a Red Cross tent, where a man was waving a Red Crossflag. They respected those gathered about the tent; but one ruffian,waiting until they came abreast, shot point-blank at a private. As hefell dead from the saddle Captain Derbyshire rode at his slayer andshot him dead with his revolver. A big Dragoon would put his foot tothe back of a Boer and tug to get his lance out. Some of the Boersstood firing till the cavalry came within twenty yards. The ground wasbroken veldt with patches of outcropping stones, which, added to thefading light, made it terrible ground for charging over. Already Tommyon top of the hill and down its sides was groping for the wounded.Tommy had behaved magnificently throughout the long fight, and nowTommy was finishing the day by behaving well to the Boer wounded. Arug here and a drink there, and later on the best place near the campfire. In the previous five hours, Tommy's respect for the enemy hadrisen enormously; now he was treating his wounded with a rough butgenuine kindness positively chivalrous. One might write for days uponthe incidents of this glorious day, into which the events of astirring lifetime seem crowded. Our artillery got a good chance, andshowed up magnificently. The dauntless bravery of English officers weseem to take for granted as a national heritage; but in somethingstronger than admiration--in positive love--my heart goes out to TommyAtkins--sweating, swearing, grimy, dirty, fearless, andgenerous--Tommy is a bit of "all right."[Illustration: Advance Of The Gordons At Elandslaagte.]IVA GLIMPSE OF OUR GUNNERSGo with the gunners if you want stirring scenes of modern war. Youwill not, as so often happens when one goes with an infantry regiment,spend a day lying on your belly in the scorching sun, while the air isvocal above you with the singing of bullets from an invisible foe,whose position is vaguely located on some quiet and deserted-lookingkopje in front. Go with the gunners, and every time you go you willcome back with an increased admiration for them. It is impossible totell the result of rifle or even Maxim fire unless, as at Omdurman,the enemy stand up to be massacred; but with the guns you can at leastsee where the shells fall or the shrapnel burst. For this reason theVickers-Maxim automatic--or pom-pom, as it was christened atLadysmith--must be a most delightfully interesting weapon to thegunner who operates it. Each little shell on impact throws up a smallfountain of smoke as it explodes, so that he sees at once if his fireis short or too high, and gets his range immediately; then he canfollow cavalry about and tickle them up, or play around a patch ofveldt where he knows the enemy are lying, just as a gardener wouldsprinkle with a watering-pot. It is a most demoralising weapon, butthe explosion is so small that it does much less harm than would beexpected.Let us take a typical day with the gunners. Photographs orcinematographs are entirely unsatisfactory in giving any idea of the"movement" of a battery going into action. There is the rattle of thegun-carriages, like a running accompaniment of rifle fire; the jingleof the harness; the splendid, strenuous, willing pull of the horsesstraining against their collars. They know all about it, thesebright-eyed beasts quivering with life and work, and want no whip orspur until the work of tugging over the broken ground under asweltering sun staggers them under the strain.There could not have been a more beautiful day than that ofElandslaagte for watching the gunners in action. Before the main partof the action was entered on, two batteries were ordered to reply tosome fire coming from the left of our line of advance. They wentforward at the gallop, bounding, jolting, and swaying over the unevenveldt, and, on a slight rise of ground showing out against the deepblue background of some hills, unlimbered and opened fire. A fewhorsemen were seen galloping over the ridge of a hill in front, andthat was all. Then they limbered up and were ordered across to ourright; a low but steep little embankment of the narrow-gauge railwaywas in front of them. It was a pretty sight to see them negotiatingthis obstacle--the jolting of the springless wheels up and down thestony sides and across the rails on top ought to have been enough toshake the teeth out of the men sitting on the limbers, and grippinghard to keep their seats. By the way, how loudly the nether part of agunner's anatomy must sometimes cry out for a cushion!No sooner had they got clear of this jump than the Boer guns openedand began to make excellent practice. How every gunner felt longing toreply and silence them! Bang, burst, or spinning with whizzing hops,the shells came dropping in rapid succession. The Boers had beencareful to get the exact range the previous day, and were not nowwasting time or ammunition. Our guns had to go up a sloping depressionat right angles to the Boer fire before getting into a position foropening. Every instant was of value, as the Boer shells were nowdropping amongst the Imperial Light Horse and the infantry, who werejust beginning to deploy. Under whip and spur they galloped up theslope--Gad! it was a sight to see how these artillery horses pulled;there was no taxpayers' money wasted there. One drops down, and thesharpness with which he is replaced by one of the spare horses wouldhave drawn ringing rounds of applause at an Islington tournament. Theytake up a position at the top of the rising ground, monopolising theattention of the Boer gunners as they unlimber.The gunners jump from their seats sharp as sailors, unhook thelimbers, leaving the guns pointed towards the enemy. Then the driverstrot off about fifteen yards, wheel round, and sit motionless on theirhorses, facing the fire. One cannot but admire the courage required tosit coolly like that with nothing to do but watch the enemy firingdeliberately at them--see the discharge, and then await the arrival ofthe shell as it comes whirring and hurtling through the air. With whatcritical interest they must watch improvement in the enemy'sshell-bowling! One was forcibly reminded of cricket bowling atElandslaagte. Many of the shells did not burst, and those that werenot full-pitched came in the manner of swift bowling along therounded, almost flat-topped surface of the rising ground; and thesegunners sat as steady as if they were the wickets just stuck in theground, with never a duck of the head or a blink of the eye. The menworking the guns are kept busy all the time, and have no time to thinkof or watch the enemy's shells; but the drivers have nothing to do butwait and watch. The horses, with still heaving foam-streaked sides,stand panting and tossing their heads. The Boers have got the positionof our batteries accurately, as it must have been previously obviousthat it was the one we would have taken up. Three of the gunners havealready been badly hit; immediately after, with a terrific crash, ashell hits an ammunition-waggon fair. Those around hold their breathfor a still greater explosion, but, wonderful to say, the ammunitiondoes not explode. When the dust has cleared, however, the wheel of thewaggon is found smashed to matchwood, and the vehicle lies helplessand useless on its side. But still steady as rocks sit the driversfacing the music. This is courage--the real article--and the marketprice of this kind of British pluck is one and twopence a day!Three days later I was photographing these boys behind their guns onthe hill at Rietfontein, standing just as quietly under a hot riflefire at 1200 yards' range, which the enemy kept up persistently,although we had silenced their guns and actually set fire to a longline of grass on the hill from which they were firing. An innocent,harmless-looking hill it seemed, with not a Boer visible on it, yetthe bright summer air simply sang with the notes of Mauserbullets--clear and musical notes when they pass high overhead, butwith a sharp and bitter ping when they pass close.But the best sight of all is to see our gunners going out of action.They go in at a gallop, and retire at a walk. There is something sodelightfully contemptuous of the enemy's marksmanship in this. One dayoutside Ladysmith was typical. A couple of batteries went out withsome cavalry for a small reconnaissance in force, located the Boergun, and quickly drove the gunners to cover. The vultures had gatheredas usual at the sound of their dinner-gong, but there was no fight,and soon the guns limbered up, and turned back across the plain.Immediately the Boer gunners were back at their gun, and, serving itwith wonderful rapidity, sent shell after shell at our retiringbatteries. The first was just short, then the two next went over; buton they went quietly, never breaking out of the walk. Then a shellfell between a gun and a limber, and did not burst. The great vultureswheeled and circled lower, waving their shadows below them on theparched plain; but there was no dinner for them that day--not even ahorse was hit. And so always, when these field guns stop barking andlimber up, it reminds one of pulling a dog out of a fight by the tailas they are dragged slowly, as if reluctantly, away; while the driversdon't bother to look round, and don't look a bit like heroes full ofcourage at the magnificent price of one and twopence a day.Rattle of iron on stones--clear, sharp words of command--clink ofbreech action--coldness of iron will warming the steel throat thatvoices its thoughts--hard, scientific, inhumanly mechanical; yet thereis a subtle, attractive feeling that draws together the livingelements that serve the gun. I barely escaped being knocked down oneday by an artillery horse galloping furiously over the veldt. He hadgot badly torn by a shell; wild with the pain, he raced around untilexhausted, and then, managing to stagger up to a gun, fell dead, withhis head against the trail.VIN THE TENTS OF THE BOERSLate in the afternoon of a day in the early part of last December Ihad ridden out from our lines in Ladysmith towards a certain positionusually occupied by a Boer outpost, trusting by my going outdeliberately and unarmed to get one of the men there to have a talk,just as one of the Lancers had a few days previously. For some time wehad been on short rations of "copy" as well as food. I rode along theedge of an empty spruit, into the bed of which my spurs would havepropelled my horse in the unlikely event of a shot being my firstgreeting. The spot where I expected to see the outpost was where theveldt, from being bare, commenced to be thickly covered with mimosatrees; but there was no one there--no living thing, except a littlespringbuck that started up as I arrived, bounding away over the longtufted grass, its little white rump showing like the flutter of agirl's petticoat. It stopped and, turning its pretty head, regarded mewith great brown frightened eyes, as if I were the first humanapparition to invade its sylvan solitude. It was clear there were noBoers immediately about; equally clear that this was a great chanceunexpectedly offered of having a try to get south to Clery's orBuller's force, and be the first white man to bring the news fromLadysmith out of the beleaguered town. I was already started on theshortest route to the Tugela. I went on, and for about a mile no signwhatever of the enemy, and I thought of the theory more than once putforward that we were all the time being besieged by a ridiculouslysmall but extremely mobile force. It was not until I was well inbetween Bulwana and Lombard's Kop that I caught sight between thetrees of a laager of miscellaneous tents on the lower slope of thelatter. Dismounting and going cautiously, I passed it and passed a mancutting wood, who was fortunately too industriously intent on his workto notice me. Bearing to the right, I was soon south of Bulwana andpast the Boer lines. The rest would be comparatively easy, as an openstretch of country lay before me, where darkness would soon give mecover now that I had reached the edge of the trees. While waiting, Iheard a voice behind me shout something in Dutch. Looking round, Ifound a Boer covering me with his rifle at ten yards, and the dream ofa journalistic "beat," as they call it in America, vanished as heescorted me to his field cornet's camp. After some questioning by thefield cornet, they gave me supper of meat, bread, and coffee--thebread arrived down every morning by train from Dundee, where it wasbaked by a Frenchman at what a short time ago had been our bakery.Then, as we sat round the big tent smoking, I gradually learned fromthem the first news of the outer world and the war, after being fiveweeks cut off in Ladysmith. As a running commentary on the news, wedrifted into a series of discussions on the conduct of the war, andthe observance of the usages of war by both armies. _Audi alterampartem_, and here I was hearing it with a vengeance. Two-thirds ofthem spoke English, as nearly all in this laager were from Heidelberg.They had about five charges against us of unfair fighting, and therewas not the slightest doubt of their complete conviction that each ofthese charges was well founded and true. The worst of it was that inevery instance they had some circumstance, the result of mistake,misconception, or individual wrongdoing, on which to raise aformidable superstructure of generalised accusation. "We fired on theRed Cross"--they instanced Elandslaagte and the battle of Nicholson'sNek; in both instances their waggons were behind kopjes that ourgunners could not possibly see through. I threw them back theirsimilar offences--the afternoon of Nicholson's Nek and their firingon the Town Hall hospital at Ladysmith. In the first instance, theysaid our waggons were too far off to be distinguished, which I knewwas the case; and as regards the second, they argued that we had noright to continue to fly the Red Cross over the Town Hall when theyhad given us a neutral hospital camp outside at Intombi. Then had wenot a right to fly a Red Cross over our sick and wounded while theyhad to wait for the next morning's train to bring them out tohospital? I urged. "No; put them in your holes underground," was thereply. We drifted into a discussion about dum-dum bullets, which theyclaimed to have found in our abandoned camp at Dundee, and, fromseeing our doolies bearers, had fully made up their minds that we wereusing Indian troops against them. I then let them have it straightabout their misuse of the white flag, which they denied.[Illustration: Advance Of The Devons Before The Attack AtElandslaagte.]Every pause in our talk was filled by the sound of deep, loud chantingcoming from a tent hard by. Presently I went out to see them at theirevening service. A big tent was full of men squatting around, theshort twilight was fast darkening into night outside, and the interiorof the tent was lit by two candles stuck in the necks of bottles.Except a couple of old men, they were all in the prime of life, and asplendidly strong-looking set of fellows they were. They sang, withoutany drawl or nasal intonation, straight out from their deep chests.The chant rose and fell with a swinging solemnity. There was little ofpleading or supplication in its tones; they were calling on the God ofBattles; the God of the Old Testament rather than the Preacher of theSermon on the Mount was He to whom they sang; and sometimes there wasa strain of almost stern demand about it that gave it more the ring ofa war-song than a prayer. Entering the door of that tent seemed likegoing into another century. It could not be but luminously evident tothe onlooker that these men were calling on an unseen Power whoseactual existence was as real to their minds as that of their Mauserrifles stacked around the tent-pole. One could not help contrastingthis obvious sincerity with the perfunctory church parade on our side,and this religion with that of two-thirds or three-fourths of our armyof careless agnostics. Barring a very small minority, principallyIrishmen, there is no place for religion in Tommy's intellectual kit.It has just degenerated into being an old magazine from which he drawshis swear-words--a sort of bandolier of blasphemy. It was hot in thattent, and the sweat made the foreheads of these deep-voiced choristersshine against the dark shadows cast behind them on the canvas. It wascurious to notice how the knees and elbows of their clothes showedsigns of wear from their favourite shooting attitude, and there weremany with buttons missing from their waistcoats that had been scrapedoff by the stones on the kopjes, or with buttons of different patternsthat had evidently been sewn on by the wearers in place of those wornoff. All the Boers appear to give up shaving when on the warpath,which adds to the wild picturesqueness of their appearance. I foundthe hymns they were singing were old Dutch ones. "We keep this upevery night in camp," one of them said to me, "just the same as athome." When they had finished, they all lit their pipes, and then Iwas put through a catechism, which was the same at every camp or withevery group of Boers I met for the next week. "What did I think of theBoers?" "Did I not expect to meet a lot of savages?" "Was I notsurprised to hear them speaking English?" And then they wereeverywhere keen to learn if we appreciated the way our prisoners werebeing treated in Pretoria, and equally curious to know our opinion ofhow they were fighting. As I thought the siege of Ladysmith, sincethey would not assault, had become dolorously monotonous, I suggested,so that things might be enlivened a bit, that a race meeting or afootball match might be got up between teams from each army on theneutral ground at Intombi. The younger men received the idea of afootball match with acclamation. "Ya, goot," said a young giant besideme, rubbing his big hands enthusiastically, "it will be the greatestfootball match that ever was played;" but an old burgher, with hisleft hand in a sling, bound up in dirty-looking bandages, interposed:"No; the only game we like to play now is the one with cannon-balls."No; these dour, stolid men take their fighting sadly and sternly;there is none of the "frolic welcome" with which our Irish Tommies,for instance, enjoy their fighting or endure the waiting for it. WhenI was a prisoner in Pretoria they used to keep us awake at night withfireworks after news such as that of Colenso and Magersfontein, but,except amongst the young boys, they were not given to exultation overwhat they had done or to any boasting. Then they talked about lyddite,and it was quite clear that it had been a terrible bogy in theirminds, and that they had imagined it was to have an effect likethrowing earthquakes at them, and it was equally evident that theresult of actual experience had fallen short of their apprehensions.We went out from the stuffy hot tent into the clear sharp air of astarlight night on the hills, and from a lighted tent, high above uson the slope of Lombard's Kop, came the chant of a psalm taken up bymany voices outside. "Let God arise, and let His enemies bescattered," they sang, like Cromwell's soldiers at Dunbar. As I laiddown in the field cornet's tent, with his son, a boy of fifteen, atone side of me, and a man over sixty on the other, I could not helpthinking of the great tragedy of all that was yet before these peoplewhen they would begin to realise that they called in vain on theirGod, that they had no monopoly of the Almighty, that the God of theirfathers fights no longer on the side of the Boers, but on that of thebig battalions. This will be the desolation of downfall.VITHE FELLOW THAT FELT AFRAIDHe was just a common or garden ordinary sort of chap. He was lying onhot, pointed, uncomfortable stones through which long tufts of coarsegrass protruded. Drops of sweat were trickling down his face, and hishands left wet marks where they came into contact with the stock orbarrel of his rifle. With elbows, with chest, with stomach, with legs,he was trying to press hard against the ground. It is a curiousfeeling, that lying down and trying to press against the ground. Hewished to reduce himself to the substance of a postage-stamp. This wasthe day of his first fight, but since he had got up everything wasunaccountably unlike his expectation. The reveille had sounded in thedark at three o'clock in the morning. It was bitterly cold outside thetents, and his hands trembled as he fumbled with his putties. He hadhad a hard struggle to turn out from under that warm rug where he hadbeen dreaming the real soldier's dream. Detaille's picture is allrot--the soldier's dream is not the picture of victorious battalionswith banners flying, marching through the clouds. He had been dreamingof tripe and onions. Visions of past good meals in comfortablequarters washed down with deep cooling draughts of bitter floated inprocession through sizzling clouds of vapour smelling of invisiblekitchens. As he fumbled with his putties the rumble of waggons cameout of darkness from a road hard by, mingled with the sharper rattlethat tells of the gunners already on the move. The vague rumours oflast night, he felt, were going to shape into the actuality of fight;but what an hour to go out fighting! Why should they be hauled out tofight in the dark? Why could not men wait for light? Wait until theworld was aired? He was thirsty and uncomfortable, with the taste ofstale tobacco in his mouth, and joined in the variegated imprecationsmuttered by the men when he found there would be only a few minutes toget anything to eat and no time for hot coffee. Presently he is a unitin a long snake-like column of men that winds along the road throughthe dark into the unknown. As he plods on he speculates how the fightwill start. Perhaps the kopjes on either side of the road may bealready full of Boers. Perhaps the beginning of the fight will be tofind that they have marched into another ambush. It was a nastyuncomfortable feeling, that tramping through the darkness into theunknown. He felt better as the light spread from the eastern hills,and felt companionship and security in being part and parcel of thatgreat mass of men that extended before and behind him on the road asfar as he could see. Suddenly there is the boom of a gun, and he comesinto collision with the man in front of him, who has stopped dead atthe sound. A strange tingling feeling goes up his spine. There is ahush! No one speaks. The whole essence of vitality strains to listen.A faint whir crescendoes rapidly into the shrill whoop of asteam-siren, and a great balloon-shaped cloud of smoke and dust hasalready arisen from amidst the marching mass of men ahead. There is nosign whence came the shot. Nothing can be more peaceful-looking thanthe shoulders of these hills lying bathed in the quiet morning light.There is no sign of an enemy. Sharp words of command ring out whilethe cloud of smoke and dust is still hanging in the air, and in adazed and mechanical way he finds himself deploying over the ground,which shakes with the gallop of cavalry as they spread out fan-like oneither side of the road. The artillery rattle and jolt over thestones, and the limbers toss like little punts towed through a choppysea. His company advances in extended order across the stony groundtufted with grass, and are ordered to lie down. The captain says,"Any men who have got anything to eat, let them eat it now." He has apiece of bread in his haversack, but feels no inclination to eat thatdry and crumby stuff; but he is thirsty, and takes a long and deeppull at his water-bottle. The sun has already become very hot. Theartillery has already got into action on the left, and is engaged in aduel with the Boer gunners. The minutes of waiting seem hours to him.Then all the men watch with keen interest an officer with a red-bandedGerman cap galloping towards them. The result of his arrival is anorder for them to advance up the gradual slope of this rounded hill.Just as he starts there is a light keen whistle in the air overheadlike the call of a bird, then another and another. Instinctively hefeels that these are made by bullets flying overhead. As he goes on anoccasional one rings with a sharp bitterness in its tone, and he duckshis head as one might duck to the swish of a riding-whip near theface. They go with knees and backs bent, and he longs for the orderto halt and lie down again. A fellow drops out alongside of him, buthe does not look to see what has happened--he is afraid to look. Justwhen they have reached the crest of the hill, and when the whistlingsounds have become more plentiful than ever, they are ordered to liedown again. Looking through the streaky stems of grass immediately infront of him, he can see a similarly shaped hill about 1200 yardsaway. It looks absolutely deserted. Nothing moves upon the skyline.Little puffs of smoke momentarily appear above it, which he knows arecaused by the bursting of our shrapnel. He begins to feel he is reallyin the fight, but it is just altogether opposite to what he expects.It is commonplace and disappointing to a degree. He sees the gunnersbusy on the left, the horses standing behind them as if all thewhistling sounds are only a rain-shower. There is a small stone infront of him, just half the size of his helmet. He knows it is nothalf big enough to cover him. All his preconceived ideas of a fightare crumbling away. Here they are being led out to lie on the grass tobe potted at, and not allowed to reply. But then, as he looks at theopposite hill, he sees nothing to fire at. A group of red-cappedofficers walk their horses along the line left behind them. Herecognises the General in command. They stop, and one of the General'saides-de-camp dismounts and opens a paper parcel, from which theGeneral takes a sandwich and bites a big semicircular piece out of it.He finds it hard to realise that this is a battle and that this is theGeneral commanding. In all pictures of battles that he has seen fromhis youth upwards the General is seated on a horse poised on two legs,and waving a sword or pointing with a marshal's b?ton. And here is aGeneral with a sandwich with a big bite out of it, who points with thesandwich-hand instead. And then he begins to wonder, with all thismultitudinous whistling, that nobody seems to be hit. Then the orderis given to advance again. He feels a tremendous disinclination toleave the stone, and waits to see the other men around him get up.They all get up except the fellow on his right. Reaching over with hisrifle, he pokes him in the ribs. He then hits him on the shoulder withit. Thinking he is asleep, he tips off his helmet from behind. Hiseyes are quite open; and then, like a douche of cold water, comes theconsciousness that this man is dead. A feeling to get away from thatcorpse more than any other brings him amongst his comrades a few yardsin advance, who are already firing and lying flat. He keeps blazingaway mechanically at the innocent-looking hill opposite. His rifle ishot in his moist hands. An order to "cease fire" is given, and thenthere is another long interval of waiting. The whole business seemswaiting. It isn't a bit like a proper sort of fight. There is nobodyto fight; but still the bird-like notes are in the air above, andbitter little sounds against stones, and tiny little fountains ofdust spurt from the ground around. And then a great feeling comes tohim that he would like to be out of it all. There is no glory in it.The sun is hotter than he ever felt it before. His water-bottle isfinished, and his mouth is clammy. A young subaltern with aneye-glass, no end of a toff, walks along the front of the line, and hewatches with interested delight microscopic ducklets of his head,synchronising with whistles. Just as the toff is opposite him, hespins round suddenly, exclaiming, "By Jove!" and falls down like asack of potatoes all of a heap. He begins to feel a strange sicknessin the stomach, just the same as coming out on the transport. He feelsit coming on. He knows he is going to be sick, and as he is going tobe sick he wants to go away. There is no use in a sick man remainingin the fighting line. But then he feels as if he were held down thereby the weight of the whirring air. There is no room in it for him toget up safely. There is no room to go away. Momentarily the noisesincrease. Men are firing about him, and he strains his eyes on theopposite hill to see something to shoot at, and empties his magazineat what looks like a man but may be a tree-trunk, and then stops againand gets sick. Another long period of waiting follows. All the wateris gone from his water-bottle; an intolerable thirst is scorching histhroat. He does not reload his magazine, and makes up his mind to saythat his rifle is jammed, so that he need not go further with anyfresh stupid advance that may be ordered. This is no time to careabout what any one may think of him, it is just too awful foranything.The ground has ceased trembling with the cavalry, who have dashed tothe front. There is no longer any whizzing in the air. The "ceasefire" is already sounding right along the line. The man who was afraidstands up with his comrades, who are already on their legs. The oldColonel trots along the line, mopping his red face with hishandkerchief. "That was a hot business," he says to his Captain, andcalls cheerily to us, "Well done, C Company! You are damned steadyboys under as hot fire as I have ever seen." The man who was afraidopens his shoulders and pulls out the collar of his tunic and stoopsdown to wipe off the cakes of dirty earth that are sticking to hisknees.VIITHE DANCE OF DEATH IN CHINA            "A wind of blight  From the mysterious far North-west we came,  Our greatness now their veriest babes have learned."[Illustration: George Lynch Captured By The Boers.]It was the day after Tung-Chow had been occupied by the Allies. I wasriding along a sunken road between the city wall and some high groundon which houses were built. There was a sheer drop of considerableheight between the walls of the houses and the stony road below. Theshouts of Russians mingling with screams could be heard proceedingfrom the houses. At the base of the cliff two Chinese girls werelying. Their legs were bundled under them in a way that showed theyhad jumped from the height above. From their richly embroideredsilken tunics and trousers, their elaborate coiffure, and theircompressed feet, they were evidently ladies. They were moaningpiteously, and one of them appeared to be on the point of death. Theirlegs or hips had apparently been broken, or dislocated, by their jump.As I went towards them, the one who appeared least injured shrank fromme with an expression of loathing and horror until I offered her adrink out of my water-bottle. Her delicate, childish little handtrembled violently on mine as she drank eagerly from it. The other wasalmost too far gone to swallow. The hoarse cries of the soldiers,mingled occasionally with a sobbing scream, came from the housesabove, telling what they had tried so desperately to escape from. Theylay there helpless, evidently in excruciating pain, under a brazen sunthat beat down on the deserted dusty road. There was no one withinreach to come to their assistance. And there was nothing for it but toleave them there, as many under similar circumstances had had to beleft during our previous march of several days. This scene was typicalrather than singular. In a large number of Chinese houses in thevillages we passed through on our way up, at Tung-Chow, and in Pekinitself, it was no unusual sight to see an entire family lying deadside by side on the Kang, where they had suffocated themselves, or tosee them suspended from the rafters of their houses, where they hadcommitted suicide by hanging.In the burden of corpses which the river Pei-ho carried downwards fromPekin towards the sea were to be seen the bodies of many Chinese girlsand women. One day I myself counted five. There is no questionwhatever that they had committed suicide. And close to Tung-Chow girlswere actually seen walking into the shallow water and deliberatelyholding their heads under the surface till they were drowned. Such atale seems very terrible. But to any one who had the opportunity ofjudging of the conduct of portions of the Allied troops it was not inthe least surprising. Under similar circumstances our sisters andwives would have done likewise.The Russians and French carried off the palm for outrages on womenduring the original march, and subsequently the Germans similarlydistinguished themselves. This was more particularly the case withsmall bodies of men who were detached from the main force. In avillage on the way to Paoting-fu, for instance, through which a bodyof Germans had just passed, three girls were taken by our troops outof a well, into which they had been thrown before the Germans left.They were still alive. This method of disposing of their victims wasfrequently adopted by the soldiers as the safest way of hiding theirmisdeeds and escaping the consequences.News travels fast in China, and in advance of our march the peopleseemed to be thoroughly aware of the fate that probably awaited them.Although nearly the whole population cleared off before our advance,there were many, especially women, who could not get away, and whowere unable to travel with their tiny compressed feet except in cartsor on the backs of their servants. And it was principally these whofinally, in the last extremity, committed suicide.As the Chinese have agreed to erect a monument to Baron von Kettelerin Pekin in commemorative apology for his murder, it appears to methat there is an opportunity for the Allies to erect one also. Itmight be of pure white jade, which the Chinese women love, which inits translucent depths seems to hold the bright Eastern sunlight withthe detaining lingerage of a caress, and might bear an inscriptionsaying that it was erected in honour of the memory of the women andgirls of the province of Pechili who had sacrificed their lives tosave their honour.All the way from the sea to Pekin, and for miles around Pekin itself,the whole country was deserted by the inhabitants. A wave of fear andhorror preceded the advent of the Allies to such an extent thathundreds of miles of what was the most thickly populated part of Chinawas absolutely deserted. After the relief of the Legations, the peoplewho ventured timorously to return were inspired with fresh fear owingto the conduct of the Germans, who made up for being late for theoriginal expedition by availing themselves of every possibleopportunity of starting punitive expeditions on any possible pretence.Coming at the time of the autumn harvest, the actual loss of money tothe inhabitants has been enormous.From August to November a great tract of country was left deserted bythe inhabitants, who should have been employed in gathering in theharvest. When I came down from Pekin in November there was no signwhatever of life across the plains on either side as far as the eyecould reach. Thousands of acres of millet lay prone on the ground, andtheir carefully-tended vegetable gardens were scored with black lines,showing where the produce had rotted. When the Germans arrived inSeptember I heard one of their officers saying to Major Scott, who wasin charge of the river station at Tung-Chow, pointing to the fields ofmillet which surrounded the camp, "Why don't you burn down all thesecrops?" Major Scott replied that, besides not wanting to make lifeharder for these unfortunate farmers, they wanted the fodder for theirown cattle. But, as a matter of fact, the destruction effected by theabsence of the people was just as great as if the wish of that Germanhad been carried out.In all the discussions of the question of the amount of indemnity wenever hear anything of the amount of counterclaim which the Chinesemight rightfully make against us. The greater part of all thisdestruction was absolutely contrary to every rule of civilisedwarfare. In a district of about the extent of from London to Oxfordthe inhabitants have lost the entire produce of the harvest, all thevillages and towns on either side of the river have been burned, sothat on the march up our path at night was literally torch-lit withburning villages.As was natural to expect, and as we have subsequently learned, many ofthe inhabitants have been forced by the absolute necessities ofsubsistence to band themselves together in companies of brigands,whose depredations afford a fresh excuse to the Germans for continuinghostile operations. The losses inflicted on the country in this wayare entirely outside the irreparable losses which were inflicted bythe destruction and despoiling of temples and innumerable works of artwhich it will be impossible to replace. As regards these lastoutrages, there was no officer in command of any section of the Allieswho personally exerted himself to a greater degree for thepreservation, or at least to prevent the destruction, of the artheirlooms of the country than did General Sir Alfred Gaselee.Some curious things happened in his efforts in this direction. On thePaoting-fu expedition, for instance, when the troops were to pass inthe neighbourhood of the Imperial Tombs, a few British soldiers weresent on in advance, and quietly informed the custodians that theGermans were coming. Readily acting on the information, they removedall the jewels and easily portable valuables from the tombs, and theywere kept concealed in a village on the other side of the hill underthe guard of a few Bengal Lancers until the Germans had passed. Inrecognition of this friendly message the Chinese wanted to make apresent of some magnificent strings of pearls to Captain Maxwell, anephew of Lord Roberts.In civilised warfare there is generally some little respect shown forthe priests and places of worship of the conquered people, but herethere was none whatever. Horses were stabled in the temples, and theart heirlooms of thousands of years of the nation's life to be foundtherein were frequently mutilated and destroyed when they were notstolen. In the street where I lived in Pekin for a whole week were tobe seen, day by day, carts passing backwards and forwards laden withbooks which were being brought to be consumed in a huge fire keptburning in a yard outside the palace wall. Thousands of books werethus treated, so that the whole street was littered with theirfluttering leaves to such an extent that I could not get my littleChinese pony to pass there without getting off and leading him, for heshied continually at the fluttering papers. Day after day thisliterary holocaust continued. When the wind was in the direction of myhouse a fine black snow kept perpetually falling, and covered theroofs and courtyards with these ashes of dead thoughts. Hundreds ofthe books were written in the quaint characters which showed that theybelonged to, and were written by, Lama priests; many of them hadprobably found their way there from the bleak steppes of far Tibet.They were printed with those wooden blocks by which these barbarianspractised the art of printing for centuries before the time ofCaxton. Many of them also were in manuscript, which must have meantyears of labour, and hand-painted pictures illustrating some wereoccasionally to be found. They were all alike consigned to the samefuneral pyre, and thousands of volumes of unascertained, but perhapsconsiderable, value were thus lost to the world for ever. As thebleak, cold winds from the plains swept down the deserted street atnight, and moaned dolorously through the ruined houses, rattlingdoors, and flapping paper windows, it lifted these torn book-leaves,and swirled them round in a fantastic dance of death, until one couldalmost imagine one heard the lamentation of the ghosts of theirlong-dead authors--priests, hermits, and scholars--mourning over theashes of their life-work.The whole of this campaign is the reverse of flattering to our Westerncivilisation. Many of the details of the conduct of the Russian,French, and German soldiers do not bear publication. But what itbroadly amounts to is the treatment of a venerable civilisationabsolutely foreign to our own as if its members belonged to a lowclass of pestiferous beasts whose most desirable fate would beextermination.VIIICERTAIN COMPARISONSAfter spending five months with the British forces in the early partof the war in the Transvaal, and then having an opportunity ofcampaigning with the allied forces in China, it was extremelyinteresting to make comparisons between them. The greater number ofthe troops we employed in China were drawn from the Army of India. Asregards the French forces, they, at all events during the originalmarch to the relief of the Legations, were drawn from the troops whichwere stationed at Tonkin. But the French troops that subsequentlyarrived direct from France, as well as the German contingent, maynaturally be taken as average samples of their respective armies. Itis true that outside the siege of Tientsin there was very littleserious fighting. The engagements on the march up were not severeones, except that outside the eastern gate of Pekin itself. The actionhere, however, was entirely confined to the Japanese. If this campaigndid not afford opportunities of observing the various troops undersevere strain of battle, it made up for it in a way by testing theirqualities, resources, and equipment for campaigning underexceptionally trying circumstances. The weather during August, whenthe march for the relief took place, was exceptionally hot, farsurpassing anything that I experienced in South Africa. The roads,where there were any that might be dignified by that name, wereextremely bad, the dust was intense, the supply of water of the mostinferior quality, and the expedition, not being under the command ofone general, added irksome difficulties by the uncertainty of themovements of its constituent parts from day to day.Fighting is not the sole duty of soldiers in the field, and in almostall their other duties apart from that we had ample and variedopportunities of contrasting their merits. The Japanese infantry werea surprise and a revelation to most of the Allies. Notwithstanding theenormous trouble they have taken with their cavalry, it is immenselyinferior to every other arm of their service. This is not to bewondered at when we reflect how little the Japanese are accustomed tohorse-riding at home, and what small opportunities they have ofacquiring that knowledge of the management of horses which comesinstinctively to the English groom, to the Irish farmer's son, or tothe field labourer. The defect of a want of efficient cavalry is withthe Japanese largely compensated for by the extreme mobility of theirinfantry. They appear to do everything at the double. All theirsoldiers seem to be perpetually kept in the best of hard training. Ifthey have not horses at home, they have plenty of rickshaw men, whoconsider thirty to thirty-five miles of running not an excessiveday's work.Often watching the Japanese manoeuvring in the field, it occurred tome that if the men of her entire army had not served an apprenticeshipbetween the shafts of the rickshaw, they must at least have passedthrough some training equally severe. On the expedition to Pekin theycarried with them a number of light calibre guns, which they pulledinto action, without horses, right into the firing line. In everydetail of their camp equipment, food-supply, and field hospital corps,there was a neatness of packing and arrangement which apparentlyresulted in their carrying all their requirements in about a thirdless space than any of the others. The simple fare of the Japanesesoldiers was ideal for campaigning. Broadly speaking, it consists ofrice, with what might be called a flavouring of strong-tasting driedfish and mysterious brown condiments suggestive of curry. As they havemodelled their fleet on our own, so they have drawn from the Frenchand German armies a selection of their uniform and equipment. Thecolour of their uniform at home is dark blue. But during theexpedition to Pekin their uniform was white, which would have beenmurderously conspicuous in operations against any force that wascomposed of less bad marksmen than the Chinese. This is now to beabandoned, and is to be replaced by something in the nature of khaki,as will be the heavy round German caps by something in the nature ofstraw hats or helmets, which will give more protection against thesun, although not looking so smart.Although the officers of all the Allies were immensely struck by thediscipline and equipment of the Japanese, close observers were stillmore attracted by the underlying soldier spirit which animates them.An inherent spirit of soldiering seems to possess every little Jap asa natural heritage. They seem to love fighting for fighting's sake.They appear to enjoy the whole thing like schoolboys do their games.They take their killing much more kindly than the others, and appearto be much more familiarised with the idea that it is part of thegame. Indeed, there is a zest and a verve and go about them when inaction that I have never seen in any other troops. There were numerousinstances in the siege of Tientsin of disregard of death. And outsidethe gates of Pekin ten men who were killed in their attempts to blowit up might apparently have been indefinitely multiplied at thecommand of their officers without any danger of faltering. When at teno'clock at night they advanced to take the gate by assault which theyhad failed to force in the morning, it was immensely attractive toobserve the gaiety, almost amounting to hilarity, with which theyadvanced to the attack. All movements such as this they accompany withsinging. And after forcing the gate, when they met with oppositiongoing along the wall and had to lie down before a hot fire from theChinese, who made a final stand about half a mile from the gate,the Japanese buglers stood up and played some of their quaintwar-songs.[Illustration: Boer Shell Bursting Among The Lancers At Rietfontein.]At night, in the camps on the way up, what I had mistaken for someBuddhist evening prayer, when the soldiers tramped round like a humanprayer-wheel, was, I subsequently discovered, the chanting of awar-song which had been composed by General Fukushima himself.The interesting thing to observe will be to see how the Japanesebehave when they are getting the worst of it, how they will conductthemselves when they are outnumbered, or when under the strain of alosing fight. From a sporting standpoint, I'll be inclined to lay sixto four on a Japanese against a Russian regiment. I met some people onthe way to Pekin who regarded the Russians as the best war soldiers ofthe lot. The Russians were intensely like the preconceived idea one isinclined to form of Russians. Solid, deep-chested, heavy and hardy,they gave one the idea of big, heavy farm labourers with a rifleinstead of a spade upon their shoulders. They never moved withanything like the quickness which characterised the Japanese, yet theyplodded on with a dour stubbornness which gave the impression that iftheir movements were not quick, they represented a weighty momentumdifficult to arrest. Although uncouth, and frequently savage in theirbehaviour, they yielded a child-like, or almost slavish, obedience totheir officers, and on these officers should lie the blame of theinnumerable outrages committed by them, from which they might havebeen restrained if kept properly under control.Of the many tips which one force got from another, the Russians had anadmirable system of carrying with them on the march a sort oflocomotive kitchen, which consisted of a huge cauldron underneathwhich was a coal fire. The contents of the cauldron, which appeared tobe the Russian equivalent for Irish stew, were hot and ready for themen at any halt in the march. How delightful such an institutionwould have been to Tommy in the miserably cold hours between two andfour o'clock on the veldt of a South African morning!As regards the French force on the expedition to Pekin, in disciplineand in equipment and the conduct of the men composing it, it wasabsolutely beneath contempt. Unless the art of foraging and lootingcan be considered soldier-like qualities, they appeared to me to lackevery one.I looked forward to seeing great things from the Germans. But I mustsay that I was immensely disappointed. As far as parade-ground drillwas concerned they were admirable; as the mechanical and automaticresultants of the efforts of the drill-sergeant they were possiblyunequalled. But they appeared to be heavy and slow in their movements.On one little expedition outside Pekin for the purpose of surroundinga body of Boxers, which was undertaken by a combined force of British,Americans, Japanese, and Germans, the encircling movement proved afailure owing to the Germans arriving an hour late at their appointedposition. Discussing the Germans one day with a Japanese officer, hiscriticism on them was, "Very good soldiers, but I tink too much drilldrill."If the Germans suffer from too much mechanical "drill drill," theAmericans certainly suffer from the opposite. Self-reliance,independence, and individuality of action are all very desirablequalities, but the Americans suffer immensely from the want ofdiscipline and drill. Perhaps the democratic feeling of the Statesdoes not lend itself so easily to discipline. Each one of Napoleon'ssoldiers was supposed to carry a marshal's b?ton in his knapsack. TheAmerican soldier has taken it therefrom, and is rather inclined to bea marshal unto himself, thinks himself quite as good as his superiorofficer, if not better, and, more than any other soldier, is given togrumbling, and spends a lot of his attention, which should beconcentrated on merely obeying, to expressing his individual opinion.The United States soldiers are far and away the best fed in theworld. Their standard of comfort, not to say luxury, is immenselyhigher, and would be absolutely ruinous in an army the size of any ofthose of Europe.Comparing the various forces--as I had an opportunity of observingthem in China--with those of our own in South Africa, I am filled witha much higher idea of the latter than before I had such a standard ofcomparison. Our army, composed as it is in part of Colonial regiments,is now a combination of various admirable qualifications. Theresourcefulness and individuality of action, which is the mostadmirable thing to be found in the American army, was quite equalledby men who composed such regiments as the Imperial Light Horse, theSouth African Horse, Brabant's Horse, the New Zealanders, and theCanadians.The inspiring, ingrained fighting spirit of the Japs is to be found inthe Irish regiments, who are probably the best fighting men in theworld; the chivalrous gallantry of artillery in action, which Zolawrote of in _La D?b?cle_, I saw in quivering vitality at Elandslaagteand Rietfontein, and not by the hastening of a step was the oldtradition of our artillery (to go into action at a gallop and come outat a walk) forgotten in actions outside Ladysmith. Superior-speaking,long-range critics talk disparagingly of our soldiers in theTransvaal. Germans talk of how things should have been done,forgetting that the little expedition they sent out to China was keptwaiting for a month at Tientsin before the men could start forPaoting-fu, owing to the non-arrival of some essentials of theirequipment.Far be it from me to think of posing as a military expert or a sort ofcomposite military _attach?_ to the allied forces. I speak merely asan observant outsider. In riding to hounds one soon learns the men onewould select to ride against the pick of another pack. One feels inhis "innards" the man he would like to go tiger-shooting with,although it would be another matter to put down his reasons inwriting, and much more so with soldiers in the field.From what I have seen in South Africa and China, I feel and knowit--luminously know it in the marrow of my intelligence--that for thatSouth African job, if it were to be done over again, I would selectthe British; that they have done, not alone as well, but better thanany other nation would have done. Many things might have been donebetter. But apart from the question of transport, when I saw theothers there were everywhere signs of their probable failures beinginfinitely more numerous.There are only two armies that, granted the possibility of their beinglanded in South Africa, could have conceivably tackled the job. Theseare the Japanese and the Germans. The Japs would probably have failedfrom their want of efficient mounted infantry or cavalry; thebeer-blown Germans would have been worn down by men of better physicaltraining. The war-knowledgeable brain, looking out through spectacledeyes, would droop tired in its physical limber until it was broughton a level with the less scientific but more practical weapon of thepolo-playing, cricketing, footballing British officer.The Chinese had reached that ideal which we, at the end of the pastcentury, were making an initial attempt to attain to in the callingtogether of the Hague Conference. For they had reached the stage ofadvanced development where the pen is really mightier than thesword--where the highest class in the community is that of thescholar, the next that of the man who tills the soil, and the lastthat of the man whose occupation it is to kill his fellow-man. Thusthe Orientals were naturally at the mercy of the Western countries,the largest expenditure of whose revenue is absorbed by the cost ofkilling-machines and men to work them.The Chinese have a saying that, as the best iron is not made intonails, so the best men are not made into soldiers. With our Westerncivilisation, the best men and steel and soldiers found them an easyvictim. There are no people in the world who have a higher regard forabstract justice and right than the Chinese. It is admitted by everyman who has had large commercial dealings with them that there are nopeople who have a greater regard for straightforward, honest dealing.In our dealings with them, as regards this campaign, right and justicein every case have given place to might.When the German officer I have referred to above pointed towards thefields of millet which he wished to have burned, I was strikinglyreminded of a certain mysterious picture which some years ago had beeninspired or drawn by his Emperor and Kaiser. It had been called bysome "The Yellow Peril," and depicts the figure of Germania,surrounded by the nations of Europe, standing on a pinnacle, andpointing to a broad plain below traversed by a river, and from theplain volumes of smoke rose skywards. No one seemed to know quitedefinitely what the actual meaning of the picture was. But since thislatest crusade towards Pekin, the real meaning of it is suggested. Inthis campaign of revenge, with the Germans as the leading performersin it, animated and inspired by the speeches of their Emperor, thepicture, now illustrative of recent history, might bear a more actualmeaning.  "And C?sar's spirit raging for revenge,  With At? by his side, come hot from hell,  Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,  Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war,  That this foul deed shall smell above the earth  With carrion men, groaning for burial."IXTHE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRISTIANITY IN CHINAIt was the garden of the Mission of Peitang. Not a blade of grass wasshowing above the ground. The roots of the grass itself had been tornup, eaten by the last few starving animals within the besiegedcompound before they had been killed, and the trees were absolutelystripped of their bark as high as the beasts could reach. At one sideof the garden a great open crater, fringed with the ruins ofbuildings, showed where a mine had exploded. The cross on theCathedral hard by was broken, and its Gothic architecture additionallyfretted by the scoring marks of shot and shell. But I think nothingtold more forcibly the tale of the ordeal through which the garrisonhad passed than did these gnawed, naked tree-trunks.I was shown round the day after its relief by one of the Sisters,which, by the way, was effected by the Japanese, but not until thethird day after the Legations had been relieved, although it was onlytwenty minutes' ride distant from them. The Mother Superior,seventy-four years of age, who had spent thirty-eight years of herlife in Chinese mission work, lay dying--a daughter of Count Barais,of Ch?teau Barais, near Bordeaux. She had belonged to the Order ofSisters of Charity since her eighteenth year. Three mines had explodedwithin the Mission enclosure, and walls and roofs were riddled and laytossed about in grotesque confusion. I went into the Cathedral church,which they were using as a hospital.Coming from the glare of white light outside, it was some momentsbefore I could distinguish anything in the gloom within. By degreesone made out rows of rounded forms of little children lying on thefloor. Above, the stained-glass windows were broken in many places,and the roof perforated where shells had entered, letting in shafts oflight that fell aslant the gloom. High up on the wall one lit up afigure of Christ that with bowed head and extended, nail-pierced handsseemed to point in eloquent silence to the little suffering childrenbelow. The entire floor of the church, even up to the extinguishedlamp of the sanctuary, was occupied with them. In one explosion aloneeighty children were killed, and a still greater number injured. Manymore were ailing for want of sufficient food, because when the actualrelief came they had been reduced to only two ounces of rice per day,and had but two days' rations left. Other children, who were helpingthe nuns, moved noiselessly about among the prostrate forms. Thehushed silence of sanctuary was broken only by low moaning, or thequerulous sobbing of little children weary with pain. The Sisterbrought me to see one little mite, whom she called the "first fruit"of their recommenced labour.It was a strange story, that of this little child. The French soldierswho occupied that quarter of the city had come across a house where,stretched on the kang side by side, were the bodies of all itsoccupants. They had committed suicide on the advent of the Allies. Asthe soldiers had not time to bury them immediately, intent as theywere on pillaging and looting the neighbourhood, they threw lime onthe bodies. After two days, when they came to throw their remains intoa pit which had been dug for their burial, they found that theyoungest victim was yet alive, and carried her, with her hair stillcaked with lime, to the nuns.In the midst of these ruins these good women, mostly of gentle birth,were striving to recommence their labours, and nurse, and feed, andteach the children that remained. But, conversing with them, oneperceived, underlying their heroic resignation, a strain of very humandespondency and disappointment. Their talk here was not ofcompensation. It was merely of how they could get their ruinedmission-house fit for work again--the work for which they had leftfather and mother and friends, and their homes in far-off France.It was not quite the same elsewhere, however. There were somemissionaries who appeared to take a different view of the situation.Already they were lodging claims with their respective Consuls, and inorder to guard themselves against the dilatoriness or uncertainty ofaction of their various Governments they were taking measures tosecure immediate compensation.One reverend gentleman, for instance, was to be seen day after dayholding a sale of loot in a house that he had taken possession of.Another, an American, was carrying on a similar sale in a palatialmansion which he had commandeered. The latter was to be seensurrounded by jade and porcelain vases, costly embroideries from thespoiled temples, sable cloaks and various other furs, and rows ofBuddhas arranged like wild-fowl in a poulterer's shop. As his stockbecame depleted he was in a position to ask any unsatisfied customerto call in again, as his converts were bringing in fresh supplies ofloot almost every day!Indeed, not satisfied with the proceeds of his loot sale, this worthyman was enterprising enough to levy compensation on the Chinese, and,in addition to recovering the full value of the damage sustained byhis converts, inflicted fines that exceeded that amount--according tohis own admission--by one-third.[Illustration: General French And Staff On Black Monday.]There are others who took possession of Chinese houses wholesale, andfound a source of income in letting or leasing them. The fact of theirhaving a number of converts to support was given by them as ajustification of their actions. Unquestionably they had a large numbermore or less dependent upon them, but some other means might surelyhave been found. They were very busy in those days. And perhaps thataccounts for their taking no notice of the actions of various portionsof the Allied soldiery. Wholesale robbery, cruelty, and the raping ofwomen were going on all round; a regular orgy of rapine surged throughthe captured city. Yet not one solitary voice of protest was heard.It would be gratifying to think that, amidst all these exponents ofthe doctrine of the Sermon on the Mount, there was one who called formercy on the conquered, or asked that even common humanity should beshown them, or even reminded the generals of their own rules of warand fair fighting, or who raised his voice for justice, even if he didnot in compassion. What an opportunity lost, which would not have beenthrown away on the Chinese, of showing in practice what they had beenpreaching--"Bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,pray for them that despitefully use you." If, instead of sellingimages of Buddha, they had used their influence to preserve histemples from desecration and defilement, or offered sanctuary to hispriests, it is certain that they would have more materially furtheredthe cause they have in hand.It would be wrong to say that not one solitary voice was raised. 'Tistrue it was not raised by any missionary. But there is a rough-lookingsoldier with a strong face that looks as if it had been hewn out of ablock of red sandstone with a blunt hatchet--General Chaffee, of theUnited States Army. He would be called in England a "ranker." He, notcontent, as Sir Alfred Gaselee was, with keeping his own men fromdisgracing their country's flag, wrote a letter of remonstrance toCount Waldersee, and received a snub in return for an action which,nevertheless, redounds immensely to his credit.Christianity in China has received a staggering blow, from which itwill not recover during the lives of the present generation. Itsprogress, so far as any one can see, in the immediate future is at anend. It is even questionable whether it will not be wiped outaltogether in Northern China. The terrible assaults by Boxers willlargely decrease the number of converts. The temporal advantages thatformerly ensued from its profession are now more than counterbalancedby the hatred and persecution that Christianity entails. The worstblow it has received has been through the conduct of the Alliedsoldiery during the late invasion. These men have crucified it inChina as truly as the soldiers of Pilate did its Founder. And even theChristian missionaries raised no protest against the crucifixion.Let us hear what a Chinaman says in a book just published, the authorwriting under the name of "Wen Ching." I heard the identical opinionsexpressed by many intellectual Chinese."For their gifts," he says, "to the West in the shape of silk, tea,and the magnetic compass, the Chinese have so far in return receivedopium, missionaries, and bombardment." "The _literati_, the backboneof China ... are not kindly spoken of by missionaries, nor are theyliked by foreigners."It is only "the lower orders that have always been very susceptible tothe teaching of foreigners. Their ignorance and their poverty furnishample reasons for their willingness to join the churches of theEuropeans."Also "the claims of missionaries to a right of travel and residence inthe interior ... are founded on no higher authority than aninterpolation by a missionary translator into the Chinese text of thetreaty between France and China." That "the disturbance of a local_fengshui_ by a church spire is considered as much of a grievance asthe erection of a hideous tannery beside Westminster Abbey would be."He says that "the Christian religion spread chiefly, if not entirely,among the poorer people, until it was discovered that politicaladvantages accrued to the convert." For "in many places the missionaryintrudes himself into the Chinese court, and sits beside themagistrate to hear a case between his convert and a non-Christiannative. The influence of the missionary is very great, and theofficial is often pestered and worried by the messengers of theGospel." Therefore the Christian converts are voted a "source oftrouble and a nuisance."Still, in this writer's opinion, "nothing has done so much harm to thecause of the missionary as this forcing the opium trade on thepeople." "If there are honest missionaries," he remarks, "there arealso sincere believers in the ancient faiths of Cathay to resent theinsidious encroachments of blatant foreign priests, who preach to theheathen the doctrines of self-imposed poverty and mendicancy, and yetthemselves live sumptuously enough in comfortable houses, surroundedby a wife and a numerous progeny, in the midst of heathen squalor andmisery."These are just a few extracts from the views of an intelligentChinaman as regards the question of missionaries in his country. Butin conversation with others I heard similar opinions more forciblyput. They point out that the various exponents of Christianity insistthat each alone expounds the right version, which is puzzling to theChinese, and that the missionaries actually have not agreed as to thename of their God, as they use five different characters.Within the radius of an eighteen-penny cab fare from where I write, Ithink there is plenty of spiritually productive work for all themissionaries in China; work for all the sincere, self-sacrificingmissionaries--and there are still many of them in China--men animatedby the spirit of the Twelve Fishermen, who have not adopted theirprofession as a means of livelihood, in addition to a secure incomegetting an extra ?30 for every baby born in their families. Andwithin the radius I speak of, they would not first have the task ofweaning the people away from the doctrines of Confucius orBuddha--"Him all wisest, best, most pitiful, whose lips comfort theworld," which doctrines are the very breathing--the life--of theirsocial as well as spiritual being. When the Chinese see the GermanEmperor using missionaries as live-bait to catch a province, and theFrench insisting upon being given another as the price of a fewmembers of one of those religious orders they have expelled fromFrance, it is no wonder that from that stricken, bullied, cheatedpeople the cry goes up to the empty heavens--      "To my own Gods I go.  It may be they shall give me greater ease  Than your cold Christ and tangled Trinities."XEX ORIENTE LUXWhat is a barbarian? In many of the Chinese edicts we see the termperpetually applied to those people outside the Celestial Kingdom, andto all those who are not Chinese. The Japanese are far too polite touse such a word. Yet I have spoken to Japanese artists who, inreferring to European taste in Art, used a word equivalent tobarbarous. The average free-born Briton travelling round the worldcarries with him, or is supposed to carry with him, his Bible, and ataste for Bass's beer and beefsteak. According as a country does ordoes not possess these essentials, and according as its own attributesof civilisation are removed from his own standards of perfection, sodoes he regard its inhabitants as more or less barbarians. (I wasrather amused watching a play in Tokio once, where the villain of thepiece was a red-whiskered Englishman, in a loud crossbar suit and afore-and-aft cap, who was always shown on the stage with half a dozenbottles of Bass on a table beside him.) When we bear in mind how muchBritishers despise their next-door neighbours across the Channel fortheir defective beefsteakiali-ties, it is not surprising that such afeeling should be greatly intensified when they come in contact with acivilisation so much more alien and remote from their own as that ofChina and Japan. It needs only a quiet observation and the smallestdegree of intellectual elasticity to be forced to the conclusion thatthe advantages are not altogether on our side, and that there is greatscope for the East to send social missionaries to the West. Socially,I think we have far more to learn from them than they have to learnfrom us. And, curiously enough, if such a mission were started, itwould not be entirely to teach us new things, but in many ways itwould be recalling us to points which we have hurried away from in therapid progress of our material civilisation for the last couple ofhundred years.The central idea, the social pivot, the focus of the life, of thecivilisation of the East is to be found in their idea of the home. Thehome is the centre of gravity of their existence, round whicheverything else revolves. In China it is the all-pervading,all-vivifying idea of social life, of religion, and of government. Thelife of the family is not only of to-day, but extends back into avenerable past, and is the hope and care of the future.For us, the dead past buries its dead, and the flowers that we lay onthe newly-made grave quickly wither on the freshly-turned clay onwhich we have left them--except where the place of natural ones istaken by those deliciously ironical representations in the shape oftin--waterproof imitations which save the mourner the trouble ofrenewal.As to the love of the Chinese and Japanese for their children, it hasto be seen to be appreciated. Those wise-eyed little mites, who beforethey can walk sit perpetually enthroned upon their mothers' backsthroughout the livelong day, are a source of so much joy and adorationto their parents that one feels no surprise at not hearing them cry asother children do. I only recollect hearing a child cry once during atwo months' stay in Japan, and then there was an excuse for itsdolorous plaint, because its mother was shaving its little head with ablunt razor and no soap. It must be obvious to the student of ourWestern civilisation that the cult of family life is on the decline.The ties and obligations which hold children and parents together arevisibly slackening, and this is the more obvious amongst those nationswhich have been taking the lead in the material progress of our time.Take the United States, for instance. There, up to a certain point,the father is regarded as the dollar-grinding machine. The tendency isfor both sons and daughters to cast themselves loose from parentalties, and strike out afresh for themselves. And their parents are aslittle responsible for them as they are for the maintenance orhappiness of their parents.Any one who is familiar with life in the East End of London willappreciate how little these worn-out toilers, when old ageincapacitates them from work, can rely on being kept out of the Unionby their children. With the experience of nearly two thousand years ofthe progress of Christendom, it is not surprising that a short timeago we should hear the present occupant of the Papal Throne raisinghis aged voice to recall the attention of the West to how rapidly theidea of the family was being lost, as Leo XIII. did in the EncyclicalAddress to the Catholic Church on the subject of the Holy Family.From the more important teaching as regards family life, theseOriental missionaries might then endeavour to tell us something of theFine Arts in the East, and yet more of the spirit which animates theirartists. They would be able to show us that "art for art's sake" withthem is no empty phrase. It would doubtless surprise many Westernersto know that a Chinese painter would not think of selling his picturesfor money, but paints them for his own pleasure, and gives his work aspresents to his friends, and would no more dream of selling a picturethan an English girl would of selling a kiss.The Japanese would have a lot to tell us about bringing art, and thattheir highest and best art, into the utensils of everyday life, andthat there is nothing demeaning in expending the best work on thingsone handles and uses every day. What a lot they would have to tell usof the cultivation and their love of flowers--a love which seemsinstinct in the poorest peasant, and which in the more cultivatedclasses is carried to an exquisite degree of refined development! Andagain, a Japanese incense party, where different qualities ofdelicately aromatic incense are passed round--and the pastime consistsin placing the different qualities in the order of the beauty of theirperfume--would almost suggest that the West had neglected thecultivation of one of the five senses.At a dinner-party at a well-known restaurant, the other night, it wasforcibly brought to my mind what a lot they would have to teach usregarding the enjoyment of such social functions. A perfect din andrattle of plates and knives filled the air, a mob of undisciplinedservants charged about tumultuously, garish lights lit up vulgarornamentation, and one almost had to shout to be heard across thetable, while a band of music outside ineffectually endeavoured todrown the din within. There were flowers, it is true, but theirprofusion was no compensation for an utter lack of artisticarrangement. But there was a complete absence of that repose, thatrestfulness, that calm, which is considered, and justly considered,amongst Easterns as the essential atmosphere for the enjoyment of asocial repast. The Japanese have raised entertainment to the level ofa fine art. Their tea ceremonies, as we have badly translated the"Cha'-no-yu," but which might be preferably rendered as "The Fine Artof Welcome and Hospitality," have been a strong influence inpreventing them from drifting into the meretricious gaudiness soblatantly _en ?vidence_ in restaurants like the Carlton, and ministerto that purity and simplicity of taste which is so characteristic ofJapanese art. Five is considered by them the best number for adinner-party, as with a larger number separate conversational groupsare apt to be formed. The Japanese gentleman has rooms specially builtfor these parties, and rooms only just large enough to hold his guestscomfortably. One scroll is hung in the kakemono, and in front of itone ornament, and afterwards a solitary flower. It would beconsidered by them extremely bad taste to confuse or dissipate theattention by a variety of ornaments.A Japanese lady once showed me a photo of the drawing-room atSandringham, which greatly amused her, and which she kept as acuriosity. (She was too polite to say as a curiosity of barbarism.)But she said, laughing, "Is it not just like a curio-dealer's shop?"The dinner, which actually precedes the tea-drinking, is served by thehost in person, thus doing away with the intrusion of even their deftand quiet-moving servants. Every cup, every plate, is an individualart treasure, from the Godown in which the host's artistic treasuresare kept in a seclusion that his most intimate friends have neverpenetrated. They have probably never seen the same picture or the sameornament twice in the kakemono. From the soft mellow music of the oldgong which summons them to the repast, on through its various stages,until the rare and beautiful bowl out of which they have had tea ispassed round for appreciative inspection, an air of refined reposehas characterised the whole proceedings.[Illustration: General White And Staff On Black Monday.]These social missionaries might progress from giving us some insightinto these things to the introduction of another institution whichwould be an unquestionable advantage to our civilisation--I refer tothe Geisha. Supposing that they were successful in grafting thisJapanese idea, the Western edition would work out somewhat thuswise.Take, for instance, a bachelor coming up from Oxford or Cambridge, or,say, a merchant up from Liverpool or Manchester, instead of having asolitary dinner at his club, if he wished for the relaxation ofvivacious female companionship, he would go to the telephone, and ringup "Geishas, Limited," and send word that he wanted one, or more, fordinner that evening. There would in due course, at the restaurantappointed, appear a girl with the dress, appearance, and manners of alady. Whatever her looks might be, whatever her attractions, she wouldunfailingly be bright, intelligent, well-mannered, and, above all,entertaining, for her being entertaining would be her _m?tier_, heroccupation, her _raison d'?tre_. And, contrary to what is frequentlysupposed from a mistaken acquaintance with this Japanese institution,she would not be in the least facile or accessible. Our ideas offeminine Japan are too much based on the circumscribed experiences ofholiday travellers, or books of the bad taste of Pierre Loti's "MadameChrysanth?me." We do not judge the women of England by LeicesterSquare, nor of Paris by those of the Moulin Rouge. Amongst theaccomplishments of these Geisha girls music and singing would be mostimportant. There seems much more refinement and comfort in bringingthe music and singing to you than in going to the singing and music. Aparty of men dining together would not be driven to adjourn to amusic-hall after dinner. They could order it as part of the menu.But these Oriental missionaries, in addition to introducing such aninstitution, would have a field for their labours in raising theirclients and customers to the standard of Japanese civilisation in theenjoyment of it. I present the idea gratis to any enterprising peoplewho are troubled with the question. What to do with our girls!But Orientals would have little to teach us in what the Chinese call"make face," which enters into many of the actions of our daily lifequite as much as it does into theirs. How thankful we should be thatit does not also enter into our religious life! How thoroughly theChinese must be impressed with this by their recent experiences of ourLatest Crusaders! I was listening the other day to a gentlemandescanting "on the darkness that enveloped those Pagan barbarians,"and I was thinking of another darkness or blindness which preventedthe speaker, and many like him, from seeing the least gleam of lightin the East. Yet it does not require much hand-shading of ourintellectual eyes to see EX ORIENTE LUX.XINIGHT IN THE CITY OF UNREST  "How beautiful is night!  A dewy freshness fills the silent air;  No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain  Breaks the serene of heaven:  In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine  Rolls through the dark-blue depths.    Beneath her steady ray    The desert-circle spreads  Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.    How beautiful is night!"Night really unrobes her beauty only in silence, the silence of thedesert. Never can I forget nights spent in Western Australia, farbeyond Kalgoorlie, away back in the Never-Never Land, where no rainfalls. That is the land of great thirst, where for hundreds of milesone sees no living thing, where no birds sing, not even the mournfulcall of the jackal echoes across the waste, and not even the chirpingticking of an insect is to be heard to break the utter stillness. Gumtrees, whose roots strike down a hundred feet for water, lift up theirsparsely-covered branches into the motionless air above, theirtongue-like leaves silently saying "I thirst." In that stagnant airthey remind one of the giant seaweeds that grow in the depths of thegreat oceans where the water never moves; and the silence there is thesilence of ocean depths, and so has been from the beginning. To-day myhorse's tracks made five years ago are probably as fresh as were thosewhich I followed that had been made two years before that time. Itmust be experienced to be realised, that dead silence; when lying onthe ground at night the sound of one's heart-beats or the breathing ofone's horse, tethered yards away, alone tells one that the sense ofhearing is not lost. It must be experienced to be loved, that wonderof a silent world, where the Spirit of Solitude in his own domain forever almost palpably seems to brood with finger on pressed lips. Itis the contrast with the scene that lies below me that forciblyrecalls these nights in the desert. Now, as I write, I am at theAntipodes, and focus points of contrast in every sense to thesescenes; the same moon that shines on that far-off desert is the onlything in common.The city of New York is in the form of a wedge, the point of the wedgebeing the down-town end, a great black mass that now looks driven intothe moonlit water. Down here, as if with sheer weight of pressure ofcrowding humanity, the houses seem driven upward. There being notenough room on the end of the wedge for the people, they are forcedupwards for room, as one would squeeze paint from an artist's tube.They rise up in tall, irregular-shaped shafts of various heights, as achild might stand its long toy bricks on end anyhow. As I write I amlooking down from the thirtieth story of one of the highest, feelingas if I had been "set on the pinnacle of the Temple" (of Mammon?).The great city lies below me, but though it is night it does notappear to lie in repose. If it sleeps, it is a restless, troubledsleep. The air is vocal with many noises that come up from below as anexhalation; white flames of steam wave from the tops of buildingsbelow me. Up here on this giddy height a hot wind of the upper air isblowing, and a vibrating, murmurous throbbing pulsates through thebuilding itself. This latter is caused by the elevators, those veinsand arteries of the structure, and their motion must never cease orelse a clot of humanity would be left marooned in the upper storeys.Across the river on the west side a row of lights are moving in onedirection, and alongside them a row moving in the opposite, like antsat work. These are the trolly-cars crossing Brooklyn Bridge. North andsouth, to the sound of a jangling rattle, the trams on the Elevatedare moving, and along the streets the trolly-cars, with their boomingnote, which crescendoes up the scale with increasing speed anddiminuendoes with the slackening of it. Out on the water the red andgreen lights of the steamers move about in irregular tracks. Thebooming, mournful call of these steamers, like the lowing of a cow forher lost calf, goes on for ever. There are times in the desert whenthe coyote and the jackal are silent; on forlorn coasts in the hoursbefore the first of dawn the seagulls cease their screaming; but thesevoices are never silent, calling, circling, and cawing, calling aroundthe City of Unrest. Different notes they sound--the angry scream ofthe steam siren, the deep boom of the incoming ocean liner, and thenote one hears oftenest--a mournful, lost wail, as of a damned soulcalling out, "Custos, quid de nocte?" "Custos, quid de nocte?" Thefeverish hours pass troublously, but there is no response in the nightof the City of Unrest.Now a great change has come over the scene; the moon has beencurtained off by a heavy mass of clouds, and its light is shut offfrom the water. The lights of the city shine out with increaseddistinctness; the moonlight that whitened the sides of the buildingsnow has left them black masses of vague shadow, and all at once onegets the impression of looking down into an inverted firmament studdedwith countless stars of as various magnitudes as in the heavens, fromthe bright electric arc-lights to tiny gaslights; and from this heightof over 400 feet one gets the impression, familiar to those who havelooked at the world from a balloon, that the rim of the horizon risesall round. "Around the circle of the desert spreads," but the desertnow is of the cloud-covered sky, and far as the eye can reach are thestars of this great city, and now through that firmament of starsthere is a dark path in an unilluminated Milky Way which marks thecourse of the river.As one looks down from here and listens to the combination ofthrobbing sounds that come up from below, there is a certainimpressiveness in the thought of being in the centre of such focusedactivity. One seems to be pressing the ear close to the heart of agreat country. I wonder what that other city looked like from thepinnacle of whose temple He looked down on the other great cities thathad their day? What Carthage looked like? The present edition of Romeand Paris and London, and Pekin from the Imperial pagodas on the topof Coal Hill, I have looked down on at night, but none of them is likethis. From the Capitol Rome lies quietly wrapped in the memories ofpast greatness; from the hill of Montmartre the electric lights hereand there give suggestive glimpses of the City of Pleasure. In Pekin,looking across the lotus-pond and the marble bridges, all that issqualid in the city is shrouded in a veil of foliage, and above thetops of the trees only what is beautiful emerges, and the city sleepsin the enjoyment of thoroughly Oriental repose; and, like asolidly-built, healthy man, London sleeps soundly; but the strenuous,restless activity of this city can hardly be said to sleep. I watchedit make an attempt at a pause for five minutes on the day of thePresident's funeral. At an appointed time all the street traffic wassupposed to stand still. My! what an effort it was! It was not a realpause; it seemed more like the gasping holding of the city's breath,holding for these five minutes as if something were going to burst;and then at the second when the clock marked the end of the fiveminutes on went everything spinning with a feeling of absolute relief.As one looks down from here one cannot help speculating as to what isto be the future of what lies below. Is it going to be the greatestcity that the world has ever seen--in real greatness, or only in acutedevelopment of material civilisation; and are the multitudes thatpopulate it going to get more happiness from the arcs of their littlelives than those of Carthage and Rome, or Pekin, or Babylon, orLondon? Or are they going at the pace that kills? Or at least the pacethat tires into premature exhaustion?But leaving these speculations, as it is now one o'clock, I get intothe cage of the elevator and drop down whirring as the floors tossupwards beyond me--"Down twenty-eight," and we pull up with a jerk,and a pale-faced man gets in. "Down twelve," and two tired-lookingwomen and a small boy get on board; and then the floor on which is anewspaper office, and a crowd is waiting to descend. The paper is justgoing to press, and their work is done. And then right down below thelevel of the street I go to see the paper actually printed. Immenserolls of paper are being lowered from the street level and handled aseasily as if they were of no more weight than a lead pencil, putbefore machines which devour them to a deafening noise of machinery.The room reminds one of the lower deck of an ironclad in action, andthe workers there seem fighting for their lives--fighting againsttime, fighting against the machine, fighting against the paper, whichwould fill up the room if it were left at the discharging end of themachines without being sent rapidly aloft; and there on the floorabove the men are fighting hand to hand with great bundles of papersthat must be sent out in time for the morning trains. Outside in thesquare stand horses sufficient for the artillery of an army corpsawaiting their burdens, and as I go up town by the surface car,although there is not yet any sign of light, I pass hundreds of men ontheir way down town to make an early start in the battle struggle of anew day in the City of Unrest.XIIA STREET IN THE CITY OF UNRESTIt was a very wonderful sight last night, looking down from thatheight at the black pool of New York specked with star-like lights--apool of darkness, where three million people slept, or tried to sleep;but it was like looking into a cup of ink to read destinies. Now,twelve hours afterwards, let us step down below into the centre of thecity, when the limelight of a glaring, cloudless sun is turned full onit--when the living microcosm of its active life is thrown on themagic-lantern screen of our retina. Now we are at the base of thesehigh buildings, and no city in Europe can show anything like them. Itis difficult to know what to compare them to. We cannot compareBroadway to an avenue of poplars in stone, for the poplars are out ofproportion to the avenue--far too high and far too irregular. There isno regular design, no continuous outline; immense, costly, new, theysprout upwards--sprout as if under the drawing-up power of a tropicalsun, sprout as if fed with the superabundant fecundity of virgin soil.Unless they were as high, there would not be room for the people downat this crowded end of the wedge-shaped town. The want of finalityabout them is no less apparent in their irregularity of size than intheir sides, generally blank of windows, in expectancy of buildingsgoing up beside them probably higher still. Some of them are to beseen with white marble fa?ades crowned with Corinthian pilasters, andthe sides are of red or yellow brick, on which is probably some huge,ugly advertisement announcing that some fine five-cent cigar is"generously good," or holding out hope of relief in the shape of apill to liver-troubled humanity. Parenthetically, I may remark thatthis city is, if anything, rather worse than London in the way ofplacards that scar the face of it. The goblin-like advertisements thatspit soap and other things at unoffending eyes at night in TrafalgarSquare are bad enough, but the advertisements in New York are worsestill. There is a fine square here called Madison, in the centre ofwhich trees rise from fountain-watered grass, and statued figures ofpeople who were men in their day and did things, palatial buildings,dignifying commerce, form the square. Yet while I have been here Ihave watched, right over a house on one side of it, a huge whitehoarding being erected, and have watched a great vulgar advertisementof cigarettes being daubed upon it. A beastly, ugly smear on one ofthe beauty-spots of the city.[Illustration: Artillery Crossing A Drift Near Ladysmith.]Bang-bang; bang-bang; bang--loud, insistent; ping-ping--sharp,piercing; the first from the trolly-car, the second from asteam-trailing automobile; a booming roar from the groundaccompanying the first, a buzzing rattle the second. Just a block awaya far louder rattle still comes from the elevated railway. Here, downtown, the streets are paved with cobble stones, and the severity ofthe climate in the winter is given as the excuse for the irregularityof the surface. Heavy lorries and wheels of horsed vehicles jangleover them, but the general uproar is so great that the bells on thehorses' collars are inaudible, and sight is the only sense that makestheir approach perceptible. The stream of trolly-cars passes andre-passes, perpetually making short pauses for the passengers to nipin quickly or--get left. Across from where I write is a restaurantwith a legend above it, "Quick Lunch." This, I think, is ratherpeculiar to New York; in other cities it would be either "Good Lunch,"or "Cheap Lunch;" here the attraction is that it is "quick." It isonly necessary to watch the way that the customers hurry in and hurryout to see the significance of it. The day is not half long enoughfor the workers down here, and the work is at such high pressure thattime for feeding can hardly be spared; it is not feeding or taking ameal, it is just stoking the human engine, and quick stoking at that.The streets of London, even in the City, are calm and peaceful incomparison with those here in New York. The very ground throbs withvibration, the air throbs with the medley of noises, the buildingsthrob with both. It is not quite obvious why the streets should be sonoisy. All the bells and gongs and danger-signals, one would think,would be equally effectual if they were not so loud, but now thecompetition of sounds is so great that any warning must almost beexplosive in its violence to be audible at all. It is no wonder thatwe find in this city so many people suffering from nerves; it is quitesurprising the number of men I have met who dare not drink coffee, menwho have had to give up smoking, men and women who were too nervousto travel in a hansom, and who at frequent intervals have to retire tothe country owing to various kinds of nervous trouble. There seems tobe no question but that this suffering from nervous disorders is onthe increase; it would be surprising if it were otherwise, consideringthe pace at which these people live; and when one sees thin, pallid,spectacle-wearing little children, one sees specimens of the risinggeneration who are destined to be still greater sufferers. As againstthis, and off-setting it, the taste for outdoor games seems to be onthe increase, and for young business men who have little time fortaking exercise nothing can be more admirable than clubs such as theathletic and the racquet clubs here, which give opportunities oftaking indoor exercise on a scale unapproached by any similarinstitution in London.When I left London in August and came here, it would be difficult todetermine in which city the streets were more torn up. Theconstruction of the underground railway here is in evidence all overthe city; explosions from blasting are to be heard at intervalsthroughout the day, and in various directions huge caverns yawn, atthe bottom of which hundreds of men and steel drills are hard at work.I have noticed within the last few years how the power of the streetpoliceman has increased for regulating traffic. In return for thepotatoes which Ireland originally received from America, she has eversince been supplying this country with policemen and politicians, andthese former great burly, beltless Milesians now despotically rule thetraffic as effectually as the London bobbies. It is characteristicthat the youngsters about the streets should be keener, sharper, moreactive even than the youngsters of London. The lithe, thin,cigarette-smoking _gamins_ that sell newspapers down town are a studyin themselves as they dart and double through the traffic and thecrowded sidewalks, selling innumerable editions of voluminous papersthroughout the day.Early in the morning going down town, during the luncheon hour, orgoing up town in the evening, one is struck by the enormous number ofwomen workers who now find employment in this great city--in someoffices hundreds of women, forming almost the entire staff, areemployed. Their competition must make it harder still for the maleclerks. Independent, self-reliant, business-like, a curious type isbeing developed of these bread-earners--a type that suggests theevolution of a neutral sex. Perhaps it is not altogether to bewondered at, and is only a manifestation of the idea of equality, thatin the down-town cars the man no longer gives up his seat to the womanwho stands holding on to the leather strap over her head in thecrowded car, and does not remove his hat in the elevator when a womanenters.Now a black-plumed vehicle comes spinning round the street corner,followed by three or four carriages with the crape-wearing drivers:apparently it is only the denseness of the traffic that prevents thehearse galloping and compels the driver to be content with a quicktrot. Quick lunch, rapid life, fast funeral, devouring cremation, orelse the weary toiler is laid down to have a first try at a real longsleep in the quivering bosom of the City of Unrest.XIIIA GLIMPSE OF A SOUTHERN CITYEvery variety of climate, pace, and people is to be found in thisgreat tract of country which has for its flag the Stars and Stripes,and any variety of taste ought to be capable of being gratified withinits confines. If I were to come to live on this side of the Atlantic Ithink I should elect to settle in a Southern city. New York has manyattractions; it has drawn to it, vortex-like, much of the best that isbright, able, active, powerful, but, vortex-like, the life swirls,spinning ceaselessly at a terrific rate, in that noisy city of unrest.Chicago accentuates the worst features of life in New York whilehaving few of its compensations, and the large cities in the East andcentre are blends of the life of both diluted with dulness. SanFrancisco is a thing apart--the air of the Pacific seems to blowdifferent impulses on the people, and great and glorious air andclimate and scenery are there, bracing with the breeziness of theWest. Florida and the shores of the Gulf of Mexico are too near thetropics for my taste, tending towards hammock-basking too much.Give me a Southern city, say in Georgia; and I have one in my mind'seye. There the people do not live so fast as to have no time to enjoytheir life, while they have all that makes life enjoyable. Successfuleffort is my nearest approach to a definition of what constituteshappiness. There, there is every scope for various effort. The cityand country around are still in process of active growth. "Fecundity"is writ large across the surface of the State, on fields, in mills, inmines. All the men are busy the livelong day. Here it is differentfrom in England; you do not find a large section of men who spend theday either at various kinds of sport, at cricket, or loiteringlistlessly about the clubs. An idle man would be a solitary of hisown sex. But it is not the material conditions that constitute thechief attraction of life in a Southern city, excellent as they are;the principal charm of the South is the character of the peoplethemselves. There is an undefined flavour of old-world politeness andcourtesy perfuming their environment The bow of a Southern gentlemandoes not appear to be the jerk of a string-pull; it suggests havingbeen learned remotely from the bow that brought the sword projectingthrough the long coat-tails as the hat was removed from the powderedwig.There is an indefinite something that tells one that all these peoplehave had grandfathers and grandmothers, instead of as in New York,where the suggestion is that they are the offspring of stock-markettickers or have been shot into the world through a pneumatic tube.That almost universal formula in America on a man being introducedbears here a real significance, "I am glad to meet you, Mr. Blank."The English equivalent is "How-d-do?" and, although inarticulate,there is frequently a silent suggestion of the phrase, "Bored to meetyou," "Awfully bored to meet you." In the South they are glad to meetand welcome the stranger at their gates, and he must be hard to pleaseif he does not have a good time within them.The general rule that the men are at work all day has its effect invarious ways on the life of the community. The social life differsfrom that of England in many marked features, in none more than in thepart played by the Southern girl. At the first reception given by themother of the young _d?butante_, the men of the set in which she is tomove are presented to her, and tacitly it is a presentation to them,by the mother, of what she holds most tenderly precious; to them, intrust in their honour, in full confidence in their courtesy, and,although their hearts are covered with the immaculate shirt-front oflatter-day conventionality, with as full reliance on knightly serviceas if that stiff shirt were the armour of the day of chivalry. Thissocial feature or condition of things strikes me as especiallyadmirable. It strikes me as so infinitely preferable to the constantespionage of chaperonage, so much more above board and honourabletowards both the young men and girls alike. They can go driving, to atheatre--where boxes are much more open and less like bathing-machinesthan ours--to lunch in the big club-room--an annexe to the exclusivelymale portion to which ladies are admitted--and will be driven to andfrom a dance, and will receive afternoon calls without a chaperon.Results point overwhelmingly to its success from every point of view.A breach of that code of conduct which needs not to be written wouldmean eternal social damnation. It is being perpetually borne in on mewhat a much better time the American girl has than our Englishsisters, and in many ways she deserves to have it so. If the man keepshorses and carriages so that he may take her out for drives in theafternoon, bring her to the theatre, take her to and from dances, ifhe keeps her supplied with flowers to an extent unknown Englandwards,if he is constantly giving dinner-parties and supper-parties for her,it is because she is worthy of it all and more.To begin with, she is never _blas?e_; and, thank goodness, it is notyet considered in America "good form" to appear _blas?_, even if oneis not. Being full of interest and constantly _au courant_ withevents, she is always companionable, and is able to talk intelligentlyof many things. Being gifted with a heaven-sent sense of humour, sheis never dull; and what closer bond of social sympathy is there than asense of humour in common? In conversational fence the thrust andparry of her play is as quick and keen as her touch is true and light,and through it all ripples a sunny Southern gaiety that is as fond ofgiving pleasure or amusement as she is readily susceptive of either.But be not tempted in this summer region, O wanderer from the chillyNorth, to wear your heart upon your sleeve for the sun to shine on,or else she will pluck it off, saying, with laughing eyes, that it isno place for it, and she will put it with a row of probably half adozen already on hers, and from time to time she will pick morselsfrom it at her pleasure; and the reason that it does not hurt more isbecause of the prettiness of her lips.It is when one meets the mothers of these girls that one sees whencecomes their charm; an old-world queenliness of motherhood, minglingwith warm-hearted cordiality, renders them immediately as lovable astheir daughters.The billion-dollar trust is very adollarable, and so is the Tobaccoand Standard Oil and the rest; but in the assets of the nation, morevaluable, to my mind, is the heirloom of the tradition of gentlemanners and cordial kindliness held so well in trust by the people ofthat city of the South.XIVTHE PENALTY OF THEIR PACE IN THE CITY OF UNRESTA dinner-party at Sherry's--twenty people sat around a table beautifulwith the choicest flowers--the room was full of diners; there was morenoise and clatter than one would hear even in the Carlton or Prince's;and the Hungarian band was playing--seemed the suitable pantinglife-breath of the scene--sensuous a little--strenuous--feverishlyrestless. Bright, gay, quick, and keyed loudly in order to be audible,were the voices of the diners; exchange of repartee, quick as the fireof a pom-pom, was shot and returned. Well-aimed marksmanship it was,too--no cartridges wasted. Flash of costly jewels or still brightereyes as the shots were sped at marks worth firing at and well capableof replying. Men who had done things were there: the senator--a greatlawyer--several of America's greatest business men, and the women whohad helped or spurred or hindered them, but who were all worth workingfor or helpfully hinderous blast-furnaces to ambition. But one seataway was a man who was one of the greatest mine-owners in America, andcontrolled railways that were connected and dependent on these mines.Pale and sallow, with sparse hair over his big bulging forehead, powerand decision and resolution were stamped on every line of his face; asmall army of men worked for him--worked underground or on railroads,or looked to him as the donor of dividends, the regulator of theirincomes, the arbiter of their financial destinies.He drank no wine at dinner, yet now and again a curious up-and-downlifting movement of the table could be traced to one of his knees,which he kept crossed over the other. He waved away the coffee withthe remark that it was years since he dared indulge in it; but when,after obviously impatient waiting, the time came when he might light along cigar, he puffed out a stream of smoke with a sigh of relief, andthe table was no longer shaken from that on. Presently some remarkdrew from him the reply, "No; the most desirable things in the worldare health and sleep. I would give two million dollars to be able tosleep six hours each night. I would give twice that to be able todigest a good meal properly. I would give I don't know what to be ableto rest, just rest quietly again."And the lady next him said: "How well I understand that feeling! Idon't see why we should be compelled to go on, on, on at that pace.Sometimes now when I have to drive in a cab I can barely keep myselffrom shrieking out aloud from sheer nervousness. I have not dined athome in my own house for three months except once, and that was when,in reply to a remonstrance to my daughter for going out so much, shesaid she would dine at home on Christmas Day. It is this perpetualrush, I expect, makes us so nervous; but it is so hard to stop, evenwhen our nerves pay the price."[Illustration: Naval Brigade Passing Through Ladysmith.]       *       *       *       *       *Coming out of a newspaper office in New York I happened to meet an oldfriend of the Cuban war times. Paler, thinner, and more drawn his facelooked in the V of his turned-up collar than when I had seen him last.After talking for a few minutes I asked him whither he was going, andfound he was going to take a special kind of bath and rubbing, whichwas part of the treatment he was undergoing for the desperate nervoustrouble he was suffering from."It is pretty hard lines," said he. "As you know, I never drank, andtook fairly good care of myself. I have not slept more than an hour ortwo for the past week."Then he told me how, going home to Brooklyn a few evenings before, thenervousness had come so badly on him that he had to hire aboy to go with him. He could not go across the bridge alone."At the present moment," said he, "there are nine men in our officesuffering from the same complaint."He seemed to think that the treatment was doing little good; thatdoctors could do next to nothing."Rest, long rest, is what we want, I suppose; but how can a fellow getrest working in a big newspaper office in this city?"       *       *       *       *       *The Remington machine had been rattling on like a Maxim gun in action,the operator taking down dictation on to the machine so quickly thatit was almost as good as short-hand. It stopped suddenly, and thefragile an?mic woman who was working it laid down her hands in herlap, saying she was afraid she could not continue. In reply to thequestion if she was ill she said no--that it was simply she wasnervous. She said she had only just returned from the country, whereshe had been resting for a week--a rest that she could ill afford, butit evidently had not been long enough."It is terrible, especially for those who have to keep working for aliving, who have to work on to keep their heads above water.""I suppose it is the penalty we pay for all this," she said, lookingout from the window at which she sat.Down far below was one of the busiest squares in New York; a doubleline of trolly-cars perpetually running through it that clanged theirbells as they swung around the corner; automobiles that pinged theirwarning gongs and darted in and out amongst the stream of trafficfish-like; labouring horses struggling under heavy loads; the carspacked with people like cattle, standing up and hanging from thestraps in the roof, toilers coming back from work; the sidewalkscrowded with hurrying people. The seats in the centre of the squareheld slouching figures with bent heads, figures of dog-tiredmen--dog-tired with work or the looking for it. A sharp insistentclanging arose above the other sounds like a wailing scream of pain asan automobile ambulance rushed hospital-wards, carrying off one ofthose wounded in the struggle.No one can quietly watch the seething life of the City of Unrestwithout being struck with the prevalence of nervous troubles amongstthe people. Every day one meets instances. "I dare not drink coffee; Ihave not drunk it for years," one so often hears--then the piteouslonging for sleep denied. "I am not going to any dances this winter;my doctor will not allow me, on account of my nerves," one of the mostcharming girls in New York said to me a few days ago. The doctors alldeclare that this nervousness is alarmingly on the increase, andthroughout every class of the community--from those who work hardest,through the longest hours, to earn their bread, to those who work atthe pursuit of pleasure--the mad social rush of the Charge of theFour Hundred. It is obvious that this pace cannot slacken--every yearadds fresh impetus. What will it be in fifty years--at the end of thecentury? What will the offspring of these quivering, twitching, highlystrung men and women be like? _Quo vadis, Americane?_Already there are antidotes or remedies for this growingevil--sanatoria where the worn-out over-worked are compelled to seekrefuge, asylums of repose for those who have long lost the art ofenjoying it. More useful, perhaps, are the facilities for gettinghealthy exercise which are offered by athletic clubs, gymnasia, andthe squash courts and tennis courts now being laid out on the tops ofso many of the best houses. But these are only trifling against themagnitude of the menacing evil. Thousands have not the time to enjoythem, and must pay the penalty of the pace of their progress in theCity of Unrest.XVTHE MILLION-MASTER IN THE CITY OF UNRESTSeven-thirty o'clock: the coffee and toast had been placed by thevalet on the table beside his bed; the warm water was already runninginto the bath in the adjoining room; three suits of clothes, carefullybrushed and ironed, were laid on the sofa when he was called. Heseemed to be awake all of a sudden--quite awake. As he was called, ayoung man came into the room with a bundle of newspapers. "Let mesee," said Mr. X., "I think I can take half an hour extra thismorning--read away;" and then the young man began reading rapidly fromthe papers. He had from long training learned to know what interestedthe boss, and read selections from one paper after another which hehad previously gone over--some closing prices of particular stocksfirst, then some foreign and general news summary, and then X. askedhim to read particulars of what he wanted to learn more about. Afterabout fifteen minutes he had had enough, and one of his secretaries,with a bundle of letters in one hand and a notebook in the other, camein. As he read the letters, X. dictated, or mostly just indicated, thereplies; they were all business letters. Then his place was taken byanother. His letters were mostly invitations, charitable appeals,letters from his steward and the head of his stables at Lakewood, fromthe skipper of his yacht, from dealers who had pictures that he oughtto buy, from the caretaker of his house in Newport, and letters fromhouse-agents in London about a house he wanted there for theCoronation. At eight he took his bath, and while drying and dressingthe litany of letters and responses continued, punctuated at intervalsby the bell of the telephone on the table by his bedside, and so onthrough the breakfast, now laid in an adjoining study, until it wastime to telephone to the stables for his automobile. Same telephonemessage occupied fifteen minutes. Just before leaving he sent to hiswife's room to find out where he was dining. Madame was beingmassaged, but sent word that they were giving a dinner-party atSherry's, having three boxes at the theatre afterwards, and that thenshe expected him to come to the Astorbilts' ball. Long cigar, furcoat, gloves, and into the automobile, his secretary sitting besidehim, still going through the unfinished letters.Three inches of snow had fallen during the night--hard, dry snow, onwhich the horses slipped and struggled as it was being beaten flat,and on which his automobile would have skidded ungovernably if FifthAvenue had not been already well sprayed by the sand-sprinklers.Progress in the upper part of the Avenue was rapid enough; but fromMadison Square slow, halting, and intermittent, horses were fallingin all directions, stopping the surface-cars packed with a multitudeof toilers, all going city-wards; the gong of the automobile clangedpetulantly. Down town the upper altitudes of the sky-scrapers werelost in a vague mist of swirling snow that eddied through thechasm-like clefts between them--there were gaps where other giganticiron frames were rising up to the rattling Maxim-gun-like sound of thesteam riveters.At length they arrived at the high pilloried portico of the immensebuilding in which his office was situated; passing through therevolving doors--mill-wheels perpetually kept turning by a stream ofhumanity--one of a number of elevators brought him to the floorentirely occupied by his offices. The walls and counters were of whitegrey-lined marble; polished mahogany desks and burnished brassrailings glistened everywhere. Through waiting-rooms and offices hepassed to his private office. It was a plain room, richly carpeted,soft leather chairs, a big table on which were only a few papers; atelephone stood on the right-hand side of the blotter. There were somemaps on the walls, nothing more. On a mahogany stand against the wallin the centre of the room, near his desk, stood the ticker, like asacred image on a pedestal. Strange little god, mysterious littleoracle--I don't think I would have felt surprised if on entering hehad knelt down before it and said a short prayer. Instead, he seatedhimself at his desk and commenced speaking into the telephone. Therewas a switch-board of his private exchange outside the private officewhich communicated to each of the heads of his departments. Withoutthe delay of sending or going for them, he spoke to six or seven oneafter the other. Then his confidential clerk came in with a number ofpapers in his hands. Tickety, tickety, tick, the oracle was speakingall the time, but he took no notice of its remarks--still it went on,as if knowing that sooner or later he would be drawn towards it; andso he was, and passed the tape through his fingers, pausing here andthere; and so throughout the day that little chattering fetishdominated him and every one that entered the room. Men came in, andwhile waiting, or in a pause in conversation, would be drawn to seewhat was on its tongue. There is nothing more striking about businessin New York than the ease and rapidity with which business is carriedout. There had been a bad break in sugar in the morning; X. meant tohave some if it came to a certain figure. All the morning down, down,it toppled. Within a few seconds of the time a deal was made from thecentre of the Stock Exchange it appeared on the tape in X.'s office.It dropped to his price. "Now, time this," said he; "1204 I want. Buyme 5000 sugar at 92" (twenty seconds gone). "He has got my message,and I am holding the wire till I get a reply. Now he has sent it onhis private wire to the Stock Exchange; his own telephone-boy hasalready his number on the telegraph-board. If he is not immediatelyavailable a two-dollar broker will execute the order." Here comes thereply: "3000 at 92 was all he could get at the price." (Time, 1 min.35 sec.) To those who are used to the aggravating slowness of thetelephone in London, that in New York is a revelation of rapidity, andso much does it enter into the daily life of the community that itwould now give something like a stroke of paralysis to the City if allthe telephone-wires should be suddenly swept down or the operatorssuddenly go on strike.A lunch at the luxuriously furnished Club situated at the top of thebuilding, and not such a serious interruption to business, as duringit three messengers come with notes from his office for him. Not muchtime to dawdle over lunch, as he had three meetings to preside atduring the afternoon; then up to the Union Club, a few moments' chatwith some friends--change into evening clothes, on to Sherry's--insidethe door of the great restaurant he sees a number of people he knows."Hallo, you, with whom are you dining to-night?" "Why, with you.""Glad of it." Then he sees Mr. Sherry, and finds his table to see howmany he has dining with him. A little late, but radiant in a Worthgown and wearing black pearls, his wife arrives--it is the first timehe has seen her during the day."So sorry to be late, poppa, but that last rubber of bridge was such aslow one, and I won eight dollars." "Good for you." After dinner hesits in the back of the box; the play or the plot does not interesthim; his mind is full of more dramatic scenes--plots that, instead ofplay, can be made into reality--real live characters that he couldmake dance to the music of his millions. Then on to that great ball inone of the palaces of Fifth Avenue, a palace to which architects,painters, sculptors, have combined to raise into a dream of luxurysuch as Rome never equalled.Strolling through the picture-gallery with an old friend, she who,though born to millions, kept fresh that perfume of womanliness whichwe call charm: "You look tired to-night," said he. "No wonder; outevery night now for four months; lunches, bridge, calls, dinners,theatres, suppers, dances, and the treadmill never stops. I sometimeswish Tom only owned a tiny cottage, and that I had to cook his dinnerfor him." "And that you might ask me to dine off pork and beans.""You, too, look tired, my master of millions." "I am," said he, "but Iam not master of millions, it is the millions who are mymaster--slave-masters with many-lashed whip that keep me hourlytoiling in their service, that never let me rest, keep me working andfighting, and have robbed me of repose, keep a glare of limelight onmy life, and after all can buy so little, not real success (I wasbeaten this week by K. in that Union-Pacific deal), not one drop ofblue blood into my veins, not one night of sound delicious sleep, notone kiss from the lips of love."XVITHE WOMAN WHO WORKS IN THE CITY OF UNRESTAt a quarter to seven the alarm-clock went off next her bed--how shewould have liked to sleep for another hour, or lie warm and cosy underthe clothes! The training in the habit of doing what she did not likehelped her into a little tin bath, and to dress close to the radiator,as it was a bitterly cold morning. At 7.30 she stepped out into asnow-covered street and then hurried across Washington-square.Bitterly cold wind shivered through the white coral-like branches ofthe trees. The snow brought out the carving on the Washington Arch;the snow seemed to suit the whole square, and make it seem still lessa part of the City--the Sleepy Hollow in the City of Unrest, with thesolid big houses around it where ladies and gentlemen lived who hadrefused to be hustled into joining in the general dollar scramble.In the street on the other side of the square she entered arestaurant, already full of breakfasters. She sat down at one of themarble tables with a couple of men she knew, ordered an orange,coffee, porridge, roll, two eggs--total, thirty cents. Her friendswere in offices down town, one of them not earning as much as she was.They were comrades, chums, so much that he often borrowed a dollarfrom her during those critical days at the month's end.[Illustration: General Yule's Column On The Way To Ladysmith.]Breakfast finished, and a glance at the paper--at least, enough toread the headings--and then out on Broadway to take the down-town car.Two passed as she stood at the corner, so packed that there was notstanding-room even on the platform for another; then one stopped fromwhich a few passengers struggled out, and she got in. All along thecentre of the car men and women were standing, holding on to thestraps, swaying backwards and forwards as the car swooped forward, andjerking forward every time it stopped. No idea in such a car of themen sitting down, against whose knees hers rubbed, to get up andrelinquish their seats--why should they? She did not expect it. Wasshe not by her very going down town taking the place of a possible manthere? was she not showing that she could do a man's work?Equality--he might think himself called on to give up his seat to oneof the weaker sex. But there is no sex in the City. Swaying,squeezing, jostling, twenty minutes of uncomfortable cattle-truck-likejourney brought her to the big office where she worked.Men do not doff their hats in the down-town elevators which broughther up to the big office where she was employed, a great room near thetop of one of the high down-town buildings; the windows looked out onthe river, now a white mass of down-flowing ice, through which thecalling steamers worked their way laboriously towards the harbour, tothe Statue of Liberty standing beside what now looked a white gravelpath of entry to the city.There were about fifty people at work in the room, three-fourthswomen, seated at desks and tables, and some occupied the dignifiedposition of little glass-partitioned rooms. She had one of these toherself, in which there was also a table for a stenographer. It was apublishing-house; books, illustrations, manuscripts, were in evidenceeverywhere. Near the door was a sort of railed-in pen where men withbundles of manuscript under their arms were usually to be seen seated,waiting. Some of these were even shown into her office, and left minustheir bundles, or more often with them. There was a hum of chatteringtypewriting machines constantly in the air, like the chirruping ofinsects heard from tropical trees. Constantly her telephone rang andshe had to make excursions to the manager's office, and head printersand printers'-ink-marked men came to her with proof-sheets, and so on,till 12.30, when she went out to lunch at the women's cafe and hadlunch not unlike her breakfast.The room was full of girls similarly employed, ten to thirty centsbeing the average of their expenditure; all real workers, none of themthe fancy stenographers that their employers frequently take out tolittle lunches at the smarter restaurants at safe distance from theirwives up town. They were not a very attractive crowd--thin,flat-chested, and often an?mic, occasionally with pretty faces, hair,or eyes; but work, daily work, had left its impress on them all. Some(their luncheon bills did not exceed ten cents) looked, with theirthin fingers and arms, like human attachments to typewriting machines.There was a something not in the least mannish, but still notappealingly womanly, in these self-reliant, quiet business beings. Wasit a sort of neuter gender, a sexless being that was there in courseof development? Somehow, they did not strike one as beings who wouldbear and suckle and nurse children. Was this severe struggle andnecessity of existence to eliminate the supreme joy of motherhood fromtheir lives?Back to the office, where they joined their fellow men-workers; theywere just fellow-workers, no quarter given or looked for in thefailure to do their work. Some of them earned fine salaries, yet thereseemed a limit-point--thus far and no farther--men were always in thehighest positions. Put it down to tenacity of possession, jealousy,prejudice--anything but want of perseverance, circumspection,industry: the obviousness of the fact remains.Until half-past five her work goes on just the same as before lunch,and then up town on the elevator. Dry snow is spotting the swirlingwind that eddies round the corners; the sidewalks are thick withhurrying people; the elevator is packed to the platforms with men andwomen tightly crushed together, worse even than coming down. Shedines at a little Italian restaurant, where the proprietor, his wife,and children personally attend on their customers; it is known only toa few who mostly know each other--constant _habitu?s_--magazinewriters and magazine artists, and miscellaneous, but interesting,nondescripts; and her dinner, with Italian wine included, costs fortycents. It is the pleasantest part of the day for her--men and women ofthat little writing, artistic, thoughtful, and, in a way, thoughtlessset she had known for years; men who could never boom themselves orothers, or keep up a bluff even enough to advertise themselves; theslow steps of actual merit made their progress seem like marking time.Ruggles, commonly known to his friends as Rembrandt, saw her home--oldRuggles, who painted better pictures than half the foreigners who cameto New York, but who would never be a prophet in his own country. Niceold boy, Ruggles; but the fire was burning low in him, its only fuelbeing the ashes of disappointment.The sky had cleared, and the moon shone out on the glorious oldsquare, and red lights suggestive of old port and big wood firesstreaked the silent snow from the windows. "Bully, isn't it?" And thesilent pressure of her arm was affirmative of complete understanding.Her tiny sitting-room was warm; the cheap eastern rugs and dark greenbackground of the walls and some clever original sketches, all were inthe harmony of taste that loved restfulness. She lit the gas-stove ofimitation logs; Ruggles wheeled a chair in front of it and filled hispipe; from his match she glowed a cigarette, and with a great sigh ofrelief and tiredness lay back on the sofa.Then they chatted chum-like of many things. She was doing well--doinga man's work and getting a man's pay, supporting her mother and thetwo younger girls in the country. It was a strain; but is notsuccessful effort Brian L'Estrange's definition of happiness? So theychatted on until it was time for Ruggles to go."Thank you so much for coming, dear old Ruggles; it is so lonely whenI come back here by myself.""Why don't you get married?""Ah! I don't know. Perhaps I'm getting old working, and the men Iwould like to marry don't care for me, and those that would I don'tlike. I don't think I want really to marry any one, either."As he shook hands at the door he said, "You ought to get married,girlie. What a good, and true, and beautiful mother you would make fora boy-child!"The shooting of the door-hasp seemed to let go the flood-gates of herheart. There was the great longing of her heart--to bear a boy-child."For joy that a man is born into the world" seemed vaguely ringing inher ears. Like a deep-down spring surface-seeking, that old desirewelled up, the perfect reward and crown of valiant womanhood--and shefelt how good and tender and true a mother she could be; and as thedesolation of denial flooded her soul she threw herself on that sofamade of empty cases, held the cushions to her, and cried--cried as ifher heart would break.Being independent
