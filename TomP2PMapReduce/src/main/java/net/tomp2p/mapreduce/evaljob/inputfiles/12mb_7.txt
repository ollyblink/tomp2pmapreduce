 an' my arm'smost bwoke with tiredness."I remember clearly one typical escapade. It had snowed for threesuccessive days and nights. Joy-of-Life was away in Washington, readinga learned paper before some convention of economists. Her mother passedthe shut-in hours patiently by the fireside, meditating withdisapproval on Dante's _Inferno_ which I was reading to her, atintervals, for cheer during her daughter's absence. Sigurd was spoilingfor a romp. At last, in desperation, he amused himself by eatingeverything he came across,--a tube of paste, a roll of tissue paper,one of his own ribbons. I saw the latter end of the ribbon disappearinginto his mouth and sprang to seize it, meaning to drag the rest out ofhis inner recesses, but Sigurd secured it by a furious gulp and caperedaway in triumph. At last the flakes had ceased falling, the snow plowhad struggled through and, yielding to the big puppy's desperateurgency, I took him out to walk, following after the plow betweenglittering walls as high as my shoulder. At a turn in the road, Icaught sight, across the level expanse, of the Younger Sisterexercising an invisible Laddie. Suddenly there appeared above theparapet the tips of two golden-brown ears, pricked up in eager inquiry.Sigurd, overtopped by our own wall, could not have seen them, but withone tremendous lurch he was up and out, wallowing madly through thedrifts to meet Laddie, who, like a miniature snow plow, was alreadybreaking a way toward him. The collies touched noses and, rangingthemselves side by side, plunged off into that blank of white, utterlydeaf to the human calls that would check the onward impulse of theirsacred brotherhood.They had another glorious run two days later, when the snow was frostedand could bear their weight. Mad with mischief, they raced miles onmiles,--to Oldtown and beyond, barking at every man they met andleaping at every horse; they dashed into Waban Way and out over thespacious Honeymoon estates; they scampered hither and thither acrossthe three hundred acres of the campus; they careered back and forthover the frozen lake and challenged the college girls to arough-and-tumble in the snow. Meanwhile the Younger Sister and I,seriously alarmed lest some nervous horse, startled by their antics,should bring about disaster, had taken a sleigh and gone forth inpursuit. Disquieting news of them kept coming to us as we drove."Two young collies? I should say so. I met them an hour ago, way overin Dover. They both jumped at my old Dobbin's head, barking allHallelujah.""O yes, I've seen two runaway dogs. Shepherds, white and fawn. Theywere chasing an express team down by Eliot Oak. The driver was standingup and whipping out at them for all he was worth."Presently we came on their fresh tracks in the snow, tracks of runningfeet always side by side, until at last we overtook the truants. Therethey were, barking in duet, hoarse but happy, trying to scramble up anicy telephone pole after a spitting cat. They bounded to greet us andfollowed the sleigh home like lambs. The Sister, secretly condemningSigurd as the dangerous misleader of her angel Laddie, assured themfirmly that they were _never_ to play together again.Sigurd still had so much frolic in him that, when we had arrived at ourown door, he coaxed me to stay outside and throw sticks for him fromthe piazza into the drifts. But soon I noticed red touches on the snowand, bringing him in, found that his feet were ice-cut and bleeding. Itold him sternly that such were his just deserts and he rolled over onhis back, holding up his paws to be healed. While I was anointing themwith vaseline, a vain remedy because of the avidity with which Sigurdlicked it off, I discovered that he had lost, in his wild whirl, theornamental blue-bead collar, wrought for him by a student devotee atthe cost of many patient hours. When I had done what he would let mefor his feet and he had curled up cosily in his basket, I solemnly setabout my duty of rebuking him, but the youngster was too tired forrhetoric. With an apologetic grunt, he instantly fell fast asleep.Being inwardly persuaded that Laddie was chiefly to blame, I left mymisguided innocent to his repose.The next afternoon he limped demurely down the hill and, in about twominutes, was on The Orchard porch, exchanging vociferous greetings withLaddie, but for once his effrontery failed of its effect. Steelingtheir hearts, the Sisters refused to let the outside collie in or theinside collie out. Sigurd, always most dignified when his feelings werehurt, rose against one of the drawing-room windows, took a long look atthe sofa and vanished into the early winter twilight, not to be seenagain by our anxious eyes for thirty-six hours. It was just on thesilver edge of the third day that a wistful _woof_ on our porch sentfour hastily slippered feet skurrying to the door. Such a famished,unkempt, exhausted collie as stood wagging there! His coat was grimy,his ruff gray and tangled, and from his collar, drawn cruelly tight,dragged a cumbrous length of iron chain. The Sisters, who, sufferingall the pangs of contrition, had been no less eager than we inprosecuting the search, hurried over (without Laddie) straight fromtheir breakfast table, and one of them, flinging her arms about Sigurdas he nestled in the forbidden easy-chair--for he never missed theopportunity to wrest some special privilege out of any emotionalcrisis--sobbed with relief. Spent as he was, the collie licked hercheek, forgiving and consoling, even while his happy, love-beaming eyescould hardly hold themselves open. If an attempt had been made tokidnap him, Sigurd's strength and often proved cleverness inextricating himself from bonds had stood him in good stead. Morefortunate than his sister Hildigunna and than another high-spiritedsister, Unna, likewise supposed to have been stolen--though in the sagaUnna ran away from her home (and husband),--Sigurd, if he could notbreak the chain of captivity, had managed to pull it out of its stapleand lug it along with him back to freedom.By an assiduous use of the telephone to the effect, "We are takingLaddie for a walk. Will you please keep Sigurd in?" or "Sigurd has juststarted off in your direction. Where's Laddie?" we kept a certain checkon their escapades for the rest of that winter, but they contrived tomeet at some secret rendezvous in apple-blossom time and came homepanting and jubilant, with pink and white blossoms all over theircoats. Sigurd apparently liked the effect, considering himself a Kingof the May, for no sooner were those petals brushed off than he friskedout and rolled over in the tulip-bed to accumulate some more. On thefew occasions when our runaways, oozing through the merest cracks ofdoors, gave us the slip, we dropped all minor occupations and huntedthem down, calling in the aid of an amused liveryman, an Irish neighborwhose white hairs thatched a pate where wit and kindliness kept housetogether."It's the goolden dog y'are to me," he would say to Sigurd. "Many's thegood dollar I've made out o' yez thraipsin's and throublin's."The Lady of Cedar Hill had given away to appreciative friends all thepuppies save Gunnar, but several of them had homes nearby and shethought it would be pleasant to have a family reunion once a year, ontheir common birthday. One such gathering proved enough for all time.On a delectable autumn afternoon we set forth, just after luncheon, ina roomy surrey, The Sisters, Joy-of-Life, my nephew--then a wide-eyedsmall boy, now a surgeon working for the wounded in France,--and I,with Sigurd and Laddie racing alongside, to attend Gunnar's birthdayparty. Six or seven of his brothers and sisters were assembled, but atthis distance of time I cannot call the roll. Among them were probablyHelga, who, becoming Lady Gwendolyn, lived to a reverend age; certainlyFlosi, who returned from the new owner to Cedar Hill, where hisfrolicsome years were nine; perhaps Hauskuld, dearly beloved, who, likeSigurd, was tormented in hot weather by the aristocratic ailment ofeczema, and perhaps Helgi, who, as far as the family record is known,outlived all his generation, dying at the ripe age, for a high-bredcollie, of thirteen. There was no receiving line and never a momentthat afternoon when it was easy to distinguish them, for it was all oneglorious scrimmage from arrival to departure.Ralph, growing more and more inhospitable with the years, had beenlocked up as a precaution against tragedy, and resplendent youngGunnar, the host of the day, assailed his guests so violently that he,too, had to be put on his chain, where he alternately strained andsulked all the afternoon. No wonder he never gave another party. ButDora, always bewitching in her ways, found the occasion entertainingand tolerated her children, if she could not be said to welcome them.Meanwhile, by unremitting vigilance on the part of masters andmistresses, the guests were restrained from too furious attacks on oneanother, until the banquet, consisting of a row of extraordinarily bigand marrowy bones, was served. Each dog was instantly prompted by theEvil One to covet his neighbor's bone, but after a really magnificentdisplay of authority on the part of their respective guardians, theraging bunch of white and sable was disentangled. Separated by widedistances, the collies, graceful figures lying on green lawn and bank,fell to their crunching in comparative peace, while Gunnar, spurninghis own birthday dinner, roared grace from the end of his chain, withRalph's gruff _amen_ coming down from the open windows of his prisonchamber. I blush to record that Sigurd, having polished off his bone attop speed, proceeded without ceremony to appropriate Laddie's. This wasrescued and returned to its gentle owner, already so bewildered bythese social excitements that, when a game of toss-and-catch followedthe feast, Laddie bit the leg of the short-trousered small boy, mynephew, not unnaturally mistaking that long, thin, flourishing objectfor a stick. This regrettable incident, as the Dog Gazette would putit, broke up the party, but the distressed Sisters made such ampleamends to the victim that he came to consider, as birthdays andChristmases rolled around, that scar on his calf one of his bestassets.During the period of Sigurd's distemper and convalescence we took theutmost care, of course, to shut him away from Laddie, whose bonny brownhead often appeared on the outside of one window or another, theshining eyes wistful for his playmate.On one occasion the contagious element in the disease stood us in goodstead. Sigurd was better, but still so weak that the least of walkstired him out. We kept him off the highways, lest any germs yetlingering about him might bring disaster on other puppies, but thoughtwe were safe in the woods behind the house. On a certain Sundayafternoon I had coaxed Sigurd, by short stages, further than before. Hehad spent his little stock of strength and, with his usual eye forbecoming effects, had disposed himself to sleep under awhite-blossoming wild cherry,--that exquisite springtide delight whichthe campaign against browntail and gypsy moth is fast banishing fromeastern Massachusetts. Suddenly a group of young roughs from aneighboring factory town burst through the brush, attended by a gauntmastiff, and for the fun of the thing, jovially deaf to myremonstrances, proceeded to get up a dog fight, though the betting wasmonotonously one-sided. "Buster," obedient to command, approachedgrowling and bristling, and Sigurd, who was never one to turn the otherear, trotted out with gallant readiness to meet an opponent who wouldhave made an end of him with the first clinch."Very well!" I said, blazing at those boyish rowdies, who may, by thistime, have bloomed out into heroes and won the _croix de guerre_. "Ifyou want your dog to sicken and probably die of distemper, set him on.This collie is full of it and will infect him at the first touch."Without staying to question my scientific accuracy, the hoodlumshastily called off their champion, threatened me in uncivil terms withthe police and the jail for bringing a distempered dog abroad and tookthemselves off to look for safer holiday sport. Sigurd thought he hadfrightened them away and swaggered home with a marked revival ofspirits.When Dr. Vet at last pronounced all danger of contagion over, theSisters, leaving Laddie behind, made a congratulatory call on ourinvalid, whose lyric cry, albeit hoarse and squeaky, shrilled to theDogstar as he welcomed them, now climbing up to their shoulders infervent embrace, now modulating his roundelay to the plaintive note ashe tried his best to tell them what "Poor Sigurd" had suffered. _They_were sympathetic; _they_ were intelligent; and tumbling into theforbidden easy chair, Sigurd made it clear to them, and they in turnmade it clear to his dull mistresses, that his swollen throat couldnowhere be so comfortable as here, where the chair-arm supported thechin. It was then that our last shred of arbitrary discipline gave way.Sigurd had won the throne of his ambition. In course of time, thisbecame Sigurd's Chair, given over to his exclusive occupancy, scratchedand rubbed and shabby, the most disreputable and, to his mind, the mostenjoyable of our furnishings.Laddie escaped the distemper, but of other mischances he had more thanhis share. He was scalded by his own dear Annie, against whom he hadunluckily run when she was carrying a pitcher of boiling water; he wasshot through the leg, as he was assisting in a midnight serenade givenby the dogs of the neighborhood to a belle shut up in the house of herbad-tempered master; but the sorest pang of all was the departure ofhis mistresses for another year abroad. The Elder Cousin had gone on alonger journey; the corner by the hearth was lonely for the lack ofthat small gray figure, the hands so busy with their knitting, the faceso shrewd and kindly; and all we village-folk called to express oursympathy and remained to burden theirs with long recitals of ourvarious tribulations until the Sisters, utterly worn out, had again toseek solitude overseas.What to do with Laddie? Gunnar, disgusted enough at having Flosi backagain, flatly avowed that he would not put up with another brother onthe premises. Ralph, in the fullness of years, and little Dora,prematurely, had slipped away to Shadowland, bequeathing the care ofCedar Hill to Gunnar, who was keenly alive to his responsibilities.From one of our recent visits Sigurd had come back with a bleeding earand a red blotch on the top of his head. So the farmhouse of the estateopened its doors to Laddie, but he had other views and, running awaythe first afternoon, made a valiant effort to get back to the Sisters.He took one wrong turn and was lost for a night and a day, but his rarebeauty and appealing charm won him a friend who allowed him to followher home, fed him, read his collar and soon made telephone connectionwith his distressed mistresses, already resolved to let their steamergo without them rather than sail in ignorance of Laddie's fate. Theywere stout-hearted enough, however, when they knew that he was found,to ask the Cedar Hill farmer to go and reclaim the stray, denyingthemselves and Laddie another farewell.We hoped that in the year's separation the two brothers would forgeteach other or, at least, outgrow their propensity to revert to the wildtogether. It seemed the more likely because Laddie, always fragile, hadsuffered a severe attack of pneumonia at the farmhouse, and came backto the Sisters looking more like a white spirit than ever. But he tooktime, on arrival, only to greet his household saints and indulge in abrief nap on the sofa before dashing off to find Sigurd. Away they wenton an impassioned run, from which, seven hours later, Laddie camedrooping home, and even Sigurd spent the next day curled up in hisgreen easy chair, subdued and quiescent, looking like an illustrationfor "After the Ball."Although we kept what guard we could upon them, they managed to eludeus several times that autumn, but after the first wild spurt they wouldrun more slowly, Sigurd slackening his natural speed in order to keepside by side with Laddie, whose hard panting could be heard above therustling of the autumn leaves through which they raced. The worry cowhooked us badly on Christmas day. Laddie, who had coughed all night,had to be coaxed to come out for a little walk after breakfast and wasdragging behind the Younger Sister when, turning the corner of a brightbarberry hedge, they came upon Sigurd, gorgeous in his new, upstandingbow of holly ribbon. Hey, presto! Off they shot like young wolves onthe trail. Under the starlight our truant returned, a damp wisp hangingfrom his collar. That white, wavy front of his, so carefully groomedfor the festal day, was all red and green from the holly ribbon that hehad been chewing up for his Christmas dinner. As for poor Laddie, hewas ill for a week, but rallied again, and, despite our doubled andredoubled vigilance, the brothers had still two or three runs togetherbefore the end of February brought with it the end of Laddie's life.Beautiful being that he was, he had gladdened earth for five and a halfyears. If it is hard to believe in immortality, it is harder tounderstand how his Maker could cast away a spirit of such puresweetness as Laddie's. Perhaps he ranges the celestial meadows now andhas found out what King Lear wanted to know,--"the cause of thunder."For thunder was Laddie's terror. He could be quieted only by theYounger Sister, who, going to the piano, would play her loudest, whilethe trembling collie crouched against her feet.This second attack of pneumonia was relentless. Laddie was not allowedto suffer it to the end, but was tenderly put to sleep. Shortly after,Sigurd trotted over to The Orchard of his own impulse and, without anyof the customary lurking and looking for Laddie, went straight in tothe Sisters, licking their hands and pressing close against theirknees.That afternoon a few of Laddie's closest friends--though all the townloved Laddie--gathered about a little grave on The Orchard lawn, whilethe delicate Elder Sister, wrapped in a white shawl, with Sigurd,wearing a white ribbon, close beside her for comfort, looked down onthe scene from an open chamber window. In the group below, one of usafter another quietly spoke of Laddie's gentleness and gladness andaffection, of the happiness he had given and received. The YoungerSister read a lyric good-bye that the Elder Sister had written andthanked God, as simply as if He were standing in our midst, for all thejoy of Laddie. Then we lowered the box, dropping upon it the whiterosebuds that the Dryad had sent and the white carnations that Jack'smistress had brought. When the earth went in, one voice said softly,"Dust to dust," but another responded clearly, "Love to love." All thewhile Sigurd's intent eyes and golden head peered from the window aboveand once he gave a short, troubled bark.SIGURD'S MEDITATIONS IN THE CHURCH-PORCH    The gaze of a dog is blind    To splendors of summit and sky,        Ocean and isle,    But never a painter shall find    The beautiful more than I        In my lady's smile.    The thought of a dog is dim.    Not even a wag he deigns        To the wisest book.    Philosophy dwells for him    In loving the law that reigns        In voice, in look.    The heart of a dog is meek.    He places his utter trust        In a mortal grace,    Contented his God to seek    In a creature framed of dust        With a dreaming face.    The human is our divine.    In the porch of the church, I pray        For a rustling dress,    For those dear, swift steps of thine,    Whose path is my perfect way        Of holiness.ADVENTURES    "_Puntarvolo._ Is he religious?    _Gentleman._ I know not what you call religious, but he goes    to church, I am sure."    --Jonson's _Every Man out of his Humour_.The zest, the fun, the excitement Sigurd infused into our human humdrumoutwent all expectation. I think it added a relish even toJoy-of-Life's devotions at the early service of St. Andrew's that asuppressed yelp and a vehement scamper might at any second denoteLaddie's appearance and Sigurd's instant reversion from her piousattendant in the vestibule to a wild creature of enraptured speed. Heopened our eyes to a new vision of the most familiar things. What wehad considered merely gray squirrels were revealed, through hisglorious campaign against them, as goblin banditti bent on insult androbbery. For on those enchanted autumn days, when we would be wanderingthrough the rich-colored, spicy woods, where winds laughed among thebranches and chased leaves bright as jewels down the air, theseimpertinent squirrels were always scolding overhead and dropping acornson us. I remember one such stroll, when a falling chestnut smackedSigurd soundly on the nose. He at once attributed the indignity to thesquirrels--quite unjustly this time--and made off in pursuit of a wilyold fellow that whisked in and out among the slender birch boles andled him, as if for the mere sport of it, on a far chase. I was absorbedmeanwhile in altruistic combat with a troop of ants, a foraging partyreturning to their hill-castle with a company of belated beetles asbooty. As often as I brushed the ranks into confusion with a spray ofgoldenrod, it was astonishing to see how quickly the discomfited antswould rally and how immediately every one of the madly skurryingbeetles--for their pitiless captors had deprived them of theirwings--would be again a prisoner, surrounded in close formation by amarching escort. Looking up from this insect tragedy, I saw Sigurdtearing back with something in his mouth that, for one horrifiedinstant, I thought was the slaughtered squirrel. It turned out to be myhat, which, blowing merrily away from the bramble whereon it was hung,had been captured by my friend in need, who proudly restored it,somewhat the worse for the manner of its rescue. Later on, in thehushed Indian summer noons, Joy-of-Life and I would take our luncheonout into the woods, where our golden collie would roll over and over ina rustling bed of leaves much of his own color or of brown, fragrantpine-needles, his bright eyes always on the watch for any aggressionfrom the peering citizens of the trees.The winter, however, was Sigurd's heroic season. He had the soul of ahelper, not of a pet, and longed for occupation, responsibility,service. His sentry duty at night, his guardianship in our walks, hisherding of the family into the dining-room three times a day withpunctual solicitude, these were not enough. It was amusing and yet, ina way, touching to see with what strenuous earnestness he took uponhimself the task of driving the squirrels away from the bird boxes. Forour neighbors, the "shadowtails," as the Greeks called them, were soobtuse as to appropriate to their own comfort and convenience everyprovision we made for the flying folk. We had put up in the trees nearthe house a few bird palaces, variously named, according to thedominant interest of those whose respective windows overlooked them,Toynbee Hall, the Tabard Inn, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Mermaid Tavern;but their bluebird tenants were soon ejected, and families of babysquirrels, for whose repose their parents busily chewed up mattressesof leaf and bark, were reared in those proud abodes. To this Sigurd hadto submit, though he would lie for hours on the piazza, his chin on hispaws, wondering why the Collie Creator, whom he probably took to bemuch like his adorable father Ralph, only a thousand times as big--forhad not Sigurd heard in the skies the thunder of his bark?--denied todogs the gift of climbing trees. But their attack on the food-boxesbrought these pirates almost within Sigurd's reach.From several of the upper windows had been built out simple andpractical feeding-shelves,--shallow wooden boxes partitioned off bycross-pieces into some six or eight compartments. Here we would put outmarrowbones, suet, shreds and scraps from the dinner-plates, nuts,acorns, pinecones, grains, crumbs, fragments of cheese, and here, allthe long winter through, our welcome guests were chickadees,nut-hatches, tree sparrows, downy woodpeckers, juncos, with anoccasional fox sparrow or purple finch or flock of Canadian crossbills.Our unwelcome guests were English sparrows, of whom, however, we hadbut few and those of rather subdued deportment; blue jays, who wouldfly away with big pieces of meat or cocoanut, and the gray squirrels,who would come stealing softly down the edge of the casement andsuddenly leap into the box. Here they would sit up on their haunches,defying us through the pane with hard, black eyes, and gobble till theycould gobble no more. Then they would stuff their elastic cheeks almostto bursting and make off with their plunder only to be back againbefore the little birds, so long and so patiently waiting on the snowybranches of the nearest tree, had really settled down to enjoy theleavings.Sigurd instinctively understood that the little birds were guests--tothe English sparrows he gave the benefit of the doubt--and that theblue jays and squirrels were intruders. On a keen winter day, when theboxes had been freshly filled, he was indeed an overworked collie,scampering from room to room and window to window, barking furiously atthe raiders. This vociferous warning that no trespassers were allowedsufficed for the blue jays, who would flap sullenly away, but thesquirrels were quick to learn that a bark was not a bite. Shadowtailwould only drop his nut and sit up erect and alert, his little fistspressed to his heart, his beady eyes staring straight against the dog'shonest, indignant gaze. Seeing that his loudest roar had lost itsterrors, Sigurd would leap up toward the window and give it aresounding thump with his paw. At first this new menace put thesquirrels to precipitate retreat. Off they went, nor stood upon theorder of their going. A few minutes later, one shrewd little gray faceafter another would peer around the casement edge, but at the firstview of that upright, shining figure, with the flowing snow-white ruff,mounting guard on chair or hassock, the goblin faces vanished. Sigurdwas immensely proud of himself during this epoch of the warfare. A veryCasabianca in his firm conception of duty, only the most imperativesummons could call him from his post. But when the squirrels hadlearned that the barrier between the collie and themselves was, thoughtransparent, an effective screen, and would, as before, saucily plantthemselves in the middle of the box and resume the stuffing andpillaging process more diligently than ever, under his very eyes,Sigurd, frantic with fury, would beat an utterly tremendous tattoo uponthe pane. Three times one January he crashed through the glass in oneof my chamber windows, cutting his face and paws and subjecting theroom to a more Arctic ventilation than I cared for. On these occasionsthe squirrels saved themselves by prodigious leaps into the nearesttree and did not venture back while that jagged gap remained,--sosatisfactory a result, from Sigurd's point of view, that he marveled atmy folly in calling in a glazier to repair the damage. As the man wasworking at the window, Sigurd would look from him to me with a puzzledand reproachful expression accentuated by the long strips of courtplaster across his nose.He had a vigorous ally in my mother, who brought her own bright wits tobear on the circumvention of the enemy. She knitted a little bag,filled it with nutmeats and hung it from the middle sash outside thewindow, so that it dangled halfway down in the open space which gavethe squirrels no footing but delighted our winged pensioners. It wasfun to see two spirited fluffs squaring at each other atop a lump ofsuet for the best chance to rise at the bag, till another plumy midgetcame fiercely down upon them and drove them, chirping remonstrance, offto the outer edges of the box. Then the newcomer, bristling withvictory, flew up and secured the most desirable position on thatswinging dinner-pail, while the others, nudging and scrambling, soughtfor a footing on the further side. But the squirrels studied thesituation from above and from below and presently learned to run up theblind, make a sidelong leap to the bag and cling to it with all fourlegs and feet, while they gnawed through the threads until the goodiesliterally poured into their mouths. There they would cling and feast,while on the other side of the glass my mother and Sigurd, both of themsharply protesting and angrily rapping the pane, held a Council of War.As a result, my mother bought two iron sink-mops, wired them togetherand triumphantly fashioned a bag which even the strong teeth of thefurry burglars, for all their persevering and ingenious efforts, couldnot bite open. But the happy chickadees and nut-hatches would perchthere, by relays, all day long, thrusting their bills through the ironinterstices and drawing out, bit by bit, the finely broken nutmeats.The blue jays were routed quite by accident. The support of my box, astrip of wood running from the underside of that little feeding tableto the house wall, had loosened its lower nail, and one day, when somepassing touch of grippe kept me in bed, with Sigurd sitting upright ona chair beside me, playing nurse, a plump jay lit heavily upon the edgeof the shelf and screeched with fright as it shook and slid beneathhim. He took to his glossy wings and, within five minutes, the oak hardby was alive with our whole colony of blue jays, all eying that box anddeep in agitated discussion. At last one venturesome fellow struckboldly out and lit on it, only to feel it sway and sag and, with ashriek rivaling that of his predecessor, flapped up just in time tosave himself, as he believed, from a terrific disaster. Thisperformance was repeated twice more and then the whole blue jay crewabandoned, for the rest of the winter, not only their attacks on myparticular bird box, though its support was promptly made secure, buton all the bird boxes of the house. Sigurd and I were well content aswe heard them croaking to one another, "A trap! Jam my feathers, ahateful, human trap! But they couldn't hoodwink _us_. Yah, yah, yah!"The squirrels, however, continued to be Sigurd's chief household care.Out of doors, too, he was forever chasing them, but never, to myknowledge, so much as brushed the tail of one. In his sleep, he oftenseemed to be dreaming of a squirrel hunt, his feet running eagerly evenwhile his body lay at full stretch upon the rug, and his breath comingin short pants. Sometimes he would howl in nightmare slumbers, butgenerally he appeared elate, climbing, perhaps, the trees of Dreamland,less slippery than our icy oaks, and driving out his enemies from theirloftiest fastness.Sigurd bore no grudges and when, as the pussy-willows, anemones andviolets, the robins and the orioles were bringing in the spring, he wascalled upon to adorn a blue jay funeral procession, he wore his blackribbon with decorum. The chief mourner, a little lad by name ofWallace, was one of our nearest neighbors and most honored friends. Hehad been much perturbed in spirit over the perils of the blue jay broodwhose nursery, so reckless were their parents, tilted precariously on apine branch that overhung a ledge just beyond one end of Wallace'sporch. He feared every wind would overthrow that nest, but when theshocking old mother, apparently in a fit of temper, deliberately pushedher children out herself, and they fell, one by one, to instant deathon the rock below, Wallace's grief and horror were too great for achild's good. His resourceful father therefore proposed a grandfuneral, as the only testimony of regard and regret that we could offerto the unlucky fledgelings, and Wallace, who was much preoccupied withhis future career, having at one time planned to be a dentist in theforenoon, a musician in the afternoon, and an editor at night, enteredwith enthusiasm upon the duties of undertaker, sexton, and clergyman.Called upon for an anthem, I responded with a lament which Wallacefound "too sad" to hear more than twice. On the second occasion it wasintoned at the tiny grave, above which Sigurd drooped a puzzled head,not understanding a game that had in it neither romp nor laughter.Though fond of Wallace, our collie's bearing toward small boys ingeneral was not conspicuous for cordiality. Women he accepted asessential to the running of the universe; men--except for thosevindictive monsters perched on express teams with long whips inhand--he regarded with amiable indifference; but about small boys hewas dubious. Some of our rougher little neighbors had stoned andsnowballed the new puppy. At Christmas we met that situation byconverting Sigurd into Santa Claus,--dressing him up in holly ribbonand sleighbells and hanging on him the little gifts which we were inthe way of taking about to the children on our hill. The immediateeffect was excellent. Sigurd was thanked and patted and, in hispleasure at such appreciation, he would magnanimously lick the boyishhands that had been so often raised against him. One urchin was soimpressed by a toy fire-engine that, at least through January, hetouched his cap to "Mr. Sigurd" whenever they met; but with Fourth ofJuly and Hallowe'en our troubles were all renewed. Firecrackers andtorpedoes are so disconcerting to collie nerves that no normally badboy could resist setting them off under Sigurd's very nose,somersaulting with ecstasy to see his instantaneous bolt for home;while on Hallowe'en all the youngsters on the hill would call in atroop, weirdly disguised, swinging Jack-o'-Lanterns and banging,scraping, whistling, piping, on strange instruments not of music. Onthese distracting occasions Sigurd was ready to tear those gigglingspooks to bits, and either Joy-of-Life or I had to hold him tight,while the other passed the cookies and candies for which oursupernatural visitants had come.May Day was better fun for Sigurd. He quickly understood that theMaybasket chase was only a game and played it with a vim. But ingeneral he did not care for festivals nor for any variation of theusual round. Just everyday living was joy enough for him. If Sigurd hadmade the calendar, the week would have been all Mondays. Even Christmaspuzzled more than it pleased him. Such a confusion of brown paper andtissue paper, such a flourishing of queer, lumpy stockings, suchtangles of string, such excitement over objects that had no thrill forhis inquiring nose! And for himself, the rubber cats with gruesomesqueaks inside them, the mechanical beetles that shook his courage asthey charged at him across the floor! He could not make it out. Oncewhen all the people present were shouting with mirth over a new,preposterous game of cards, Sigurd quietly picked up from under thetable a pack not yet called into service and carried it out into thekitchen, where he was presently discovered with one forefoot set on thecards tumbled about before him, while he gazed dejectedly down at themin a defeated effort to find out why they were amusing. And theChristmas parties, for which he had to be scrubbed until he shone likean image of white and gold! And if it happened that, between his toiletand the party, he whizzed off with Laddie, what unpleasantness on hisreturn!"Sigurd was especially invited for to-night and I promised Wallace tobring him. But he's too dirty now and he hasn't had his dinner.""All his own doing. He shall come dirty and dinnerless and learn to beashamed of himself."Not that he felt ashamed at all, but very tired and lame, hobblingbehind his family into a bright, chattering room, where everybodywanted to pet him and where all he wanted was to be let alone to sleephis frolic off. Why must he be waked up with foolish laughter becausethat glittering tree, which he had not been allowed to investigate forsquirrels, had given, in his name, a toy ship to Wallace, whose father,Professor Wit, must needs observe: "How like dear Sigurd, to presenthis neighbors with his _barque_!" And though for him the Christmastree bore a chocolate caramel in the inmost box of a nest of boxes, hewould, to the disappointment of the company who had heard of his skillin opening parcels, yawn and fall asleep over each box in turn. At hisbest, he bit drowsily into the pasteboard and pushed at the string moreclumsily than usual with a pair of grimy paws from which the circle ofsilken skirts would draw away. Christmas, indeed, and an inaccessiblechocolate caramel for dinner!Sigurd's most thrilling adventures, naturally, had to do with dogs, butcats were an interesting side issue. The self-protective qualities ofthe feline race I realized on our first Sunday walk with the puppy,when a gray kitten bobbed up in our path. Sigurd romped forward,Joy-of-Life caught him by the collar, and I, for my sins, picked up thekitten. It looked so tiny, helpless and soft; it felt like a frame ofsteel and wire, every little muscle tense, while its claws flashed outlike daggers and ripped up the back of my hand. In due time Sigurdlearned how formidable a cat may be. If she ran, he pelted after untilshe took refuge up a tree, but if she proved to be some shrewd oldgrimalkin who held her ground he suddenly slackened his pace andsauntered casually by, trying to look as if he did not see her.His one constant dog friend was Laddie. Their escapades were the top ofall adventure,--such orgies of wild joy that I would gladly lie awakeagain listening for the hoarse bark of our returning prodigal. But withother dogs of his own sex, acquaintance, however affably begun, wouldsoon ripen into a fight, unless the new comrade were too small and weakor had reasons of his own for declining the test of battle. With Gyp,across the way, a sly little black and tan, well-named, for hisancestors must have run with the Romany folk and bequeathed to him agenius for thievery, Sigurd did not take the trouble to quarrel. Gyp,always skulking about our premises, would make off with any of ourlighter possessions carelessly left on porch or lawn. We had sufferedthese losses without redress--for to the dog's master, only too readyto beat poor Gyp cruelly on the least provocation, we would not makecomplaint--till Sigurd came. He had been with us barely a week when,one afternoon, as we were reading under the trees, Joy-of-Life reacheda hand behind her for her parasol. It was not there. As we bothexclaimed, questioned and looked about under the shrubbery where thewind, had there been a wind, could not possibly have blown it, our newguardian stood watching our            "unsuccessful pains      With fixed considerate face,    And puzzling set his puppy brains      To comprehend the case."Suddenly he caught sight of Gyp trying with guilty haste to get a longobject, balanced in his jaws, through a favorite hole in his backyardfence. It was never done, for Sigurd was upon him in a twinkling, hadshaken him thoroughly and brought back the parasol essentiallyunharmed. Several times again he recovered our goods and chattels,invariably giving the culprit a vigorous shaking, but otherwise keepingon neighborly terms with the little scamp, till life ended for Gyp in akick from his drunken master's boot.With another neighbor, black Rod, a noble St. Bernard, the initialfriendship was soon broken. The two dogs were of about the same age andhad many a frisk together that first summer, but when Rod tried to joinus on our walks, Joy-of-Life, who thought one big puppy enough foramateurs to handle, would sternly bid Rod, "Go home." Sigurd wouldpromptly spring to enforce the command, and Rod would slowly andsulkily retreat. After a few of these experiences, Rod ceased to followus, but he never forgave any one of the three. Thenceforth for the restof their lives the two dogs, who knew themselves almost equally matchedin size and strength, passed each other, often a dozen times a day,with bristling backs and low, cautious growls, while never could myfriendliest greetings, even when I was alone, win the least wiggle of awag from Rod's rigid, remembering tail. He was so fortunate as to livein a household of children, for whom he made the most faithful ofprotectors, and often, on a sparkling winter day, I have met himcoasting with them, racing down the hill abreast of the sled, tailwaving, eyes gleaming, but the instant he became aware of my obnoxiouspresence and observation, the tail would stiffen and the eyes wouldcloud. His hostility was a genuine hurt to me, so much did I like andrespect the dog, but even in his old age, when pain and weakness layheavy on him, and the children--did he understand?--were teasing theirmother to have him chloroformed so that they might have in his place astylish young Boston bull, he would accept from me no comfort of touchor tone. Another unhappy result of these early rebuffs was that Sigurdgot it firmly fixed in his yellow noddle that the words _Go home_ werethe profanest of curses, and whenever he was so addressed, especiallyby one of us, his aspect of grief and horror was ludicrous to behold.Besides, he did not go.Through Sigurd our circle of fellowship was widened for all time. Herewe had been living on, half stifled in biped society, well-nigh unawareof the jubilant dog world bounding about our feet, but in a few monthsour own collie had made us acquainted with a democratic variety ofcanine types. And still I would almost rather meet a new dog than a newpoet. A certain Norwegian lake is twice as dear to memory for thecourteous Great Dane that did the honors of the bank and shared our teacakes there; the only duchess to whose boudoir, at the heart of afrowning Border castle, we were ever invited, impressed us less thanthe three pompous poodles, their snowy curls so absurdly like her own,that squatted on the edges of her flowing heliotrope morning-gown andwere simultaneously upset whenever one of her Ladyship's energeticimpulses brought her to her feet.Sigurd's acquaintances were legion. To only a few may space be givenhere. There was Teddy, a black spaniel who aspired to the high standardof manners held by his master, a retired army officer, and, followingexample, would punctiliously rise as ladies entered or left the room.There were twin dachshunds, who daily drove abroad in a limousine andenraged Sigurd by looking down on him, short-legged that they were,from the window opened hardly wide enough to let them thrust theirblack noses through the crack. There was the lean, forlorn old houndwhom all the dog-clubs blackballed and who, in consequence, had tosatiate his yearning for fellowship by keeping company with theminister's cow. Every summer morning a silver-headed saint whose pulpitlabors were done escorted his Mulley down our hill and tethered her inthe broad green pasture below. At a respectful distance would followthe homeless hound, who had picked up during the night what sustenancehe could from the neighborhood garbage pails. And hard of heart wedeemed that neatest of our housewives who, to keep his meddling muzzleaway, used to scatter a profusion of red pepper over her garbage. Allday long the hound would stay in the meadow close to the cow, who,uneasy at first under his attentions, came to accept them with bovineplacidity. Indeed, there was, we thought, a certain coquetry in hercarriage as, a person of importance, she came sedately stepping up thehill at sunset, the old clergyman on one side and the old dog on theother. Her friendship with the happy hound grew to be as famous in ourlocal annals as, in the realm of books, is that of the horse and henrelated by White (in his _Natural History of Selbourne_), or that ofthe swan and trout so poignantly told by Hudson (in his _AdventuresAmong Birds_).Certain dogs Sigurd would bully shamelessly, like amiable old Bounce,on whom he would hurl himself in Bounce's own yard and sit on top ofhim, growling most offensively, until we pulled him off. To thesubsequent scolding Sigurd would listen as long as it interested himand then press up against us and offer his paw, as if to say, "Allright; enough of that; let's be friends again."On the other hand, he had such a liking for our Professor Far-Away thathe stretched his regard to cover her successive dogs, Chum and Jack,though he was born too late to know her beautiful black collie,Wallace. He would even allow Chum, an adopted stray, a nondescriptanimal of preposterous awkwardness, to drink from his own Japanesebowl, spattering the water, in Chum's uncouth fashion, half across thehall, while Jack, an Irish terrier,    "With the soul in the shining eyes of him,"ranked in Sigurd's esteem next after Laddie. Professor Far-Away, whoseperilous joy it was to traverse, with Jack, unexplored tracts of Chinaand Thibet, attended by a train of coolies, would, when dull destinycalled her back to the class room, effect brief escapes by way ofbicycle runs through the wood roads, attended by a train of dogs. Whenher cavalcade swept by our hill, Sigurd would leap up as if at the callof the Wild Huntsman and rush forth to fall in. Through her longabsences in foreign lands he never ceased to listen for her gypsywhistle, and once, at least, he was literally her first caller on herreturn. He came tearing back to his own family, in high excitement,with a traveler's tag waving from his collar. The tag was penciled overwith the Wanderer's greeting, adding "how dear it was of Sigurd" to bebarking at her door within ten minutes after she and Jack had crossedtheir threshold. When Professor Far-Away writes _The Junketings ofJack_, there will be a book worth reading.Although our puppy had several times returned with a scratched face,after encounters with veteran cats, his first fight was with Major, arugged brindle bull, who lorded it over all the dogs in town. We hadbeen warned of Major and when, one September morning, I went to thedoor in answer to the now familiar _woof_, I knew, even without theuplift of Sigurd's eloquent look, what had happened. He was drippingwith blood, his own and Major's, and dragged one hind leg painfully,yet he had an air of expecting congratulations. We bathed anddisinfected his wounds as well as our inexperience could--in the courseof the next few years we became experts at canine first aid--but theinjury to the leg looked so serious that we called in Dr. Vet, whofound that one of Major's tusks had penetrated the joint. The leg waspacked in an antiphlogistic clay until it looked more like anelephant's leg than Sigurd's and was secured from the investigation ofhis own inquisitive teeth by broad bands of plaster and innumerableyards of bandages. The proud sufferer, who, claiming that he was nowentitled to all sick privileges, had insisted on taking to my bed, laythere on a fresh rug, anxiously watching every movement of the doctor'shands but enduring even the probing without protest.After ?sculapius had gone and the rest of the family were gatheredabout the invalid, who, despite all smarts and aches, keenly relishedbeing the center of attention, Joy-of-Life and I sallied forth toinquire for Major. That redoubtable little ruffian, cuddled into hisbasket, rolled up doleful eyes from a gory lump that bore but smallresemblance to his massive, wrinkled, pugnacious head. A beholder ofthe battle reported that as Sigurd was trotting innocently across avacant lot, a brighter spot of yellow weaving its path through thegoldenrod, Major, after his wonted manner of attack, came sneaking upbehind and gripped him by the joint of a hind leg. Sigurd wheeled,catching and crushing Major's head between his own powerful jaws, andthen the two dogs, locked in furious combat, spun round and round, asnarling whirligig, gathering a vociferous group of ineffectivedissuaders, until a grocer's boy, jumping down from his delivery wagon,came rushing up with a packet of pepper, hurling its contents intoSigurd's nostrils and, through his literally open countenance, intoMajor's. In a spasm of sneezing, the circle of dog broke apart, andeach dilapidated fragment made for home. Sigurd was a week or more ingetting well and he limped for a month after, but the scars on Major'shead were in evidence longer yet. They never matched prowess again,though the language that they would use to each other, especially witha wide road between them, is not fit for print.Every evening of that first week our hero was carried or helpeddownstairs and put to bed on the piazza, but every morning he crawledand scrambled up again, crying out like a child as his injured leg,trailing behind him, suffered jar or bump. Nobody could resist hispleading to be lifted back to the bed and allowed to play hospital alittle longer, and Cecilia, more than ever his devoted slave, delightedin bringing him, to his enormous pride, his dinner on a tray. He alwaysbarked for the family to come in and behold that glorious spectacle,and he barked, too, whenever the door bell rang, requesting the callerto come up at once and pay respects to the Happy Warrior. Apart fromthese red-letter events, his great diversion was trying to rid hismuffled leg of the bandages and plaster,--an exercise in which he soonbecame only too proficient.In Sigurd's last fight--with a gallant old mastiff, Rex--one of hisforelegs, bitten in three places, was put out of action for two months,but no fuss was made about it. We had grown hardened to Sigurd'sbattle-wounds. Sulpho-naphthol and his own tongue worked the cure,though it took no little ingenuity to extract from between Sigurd'steeth the stray tufts of grizzled hair that he wanted to keep assouvenirs of Rex, who, still feebly growling, had to be fetched off thefield in a wheelbarrow.From first to last, Sigurd's adventures were too often misadventures.As a youngster, he was continually getting into trouble. It seemedunfortunate that he should have so many feet, for what with thorns,tacks, broken glass, jagged ice and the like, one or another of themwas usually in piteous condition.His name brought more than one fight upon him, as our call of _Sigurd!__Sigurd!_ when he started out to investigate a dog-stranger, was oftenmistaken for _Sick 'em!_ _Sick 'em!_ and the dog's owner wouldreciprocate in kind. Once an indignant father, a summer visitor inthe town, passionately charged us with setting our dog on his two"motherless boys," whereas we had been doing our best to call Sigurdoff from a chase after those provoking little rascals, who had attackedhim with a shower of pebbles.Restless with his waxing strength he took to roving in the woods, whereonce he was caught in a trap and painfully dragged himself home with alacerated leg that he had torn free from the cruel grip of the steel.In the West Woods he once had a narrow escape. He was seen by awandering botanist to plunge into a swampy hole for water, a beveragethat, in spite of our hygienic warnings, Sigurd seemed to prefer with aflavor of dirt. The mire there has a quicksand quality, and Sigurdsank, splashing in frantic struggle, until only his nose was barelyvisible above the black ooze, but in that extremity he seemed to get amomentary hold for his hind feet, perhaps on root or snag, and by adesperate effort lurched himself up and out. He lay on the bank,panting and trembling, a sorely spent collie, for thirty-five minutesby the botanist's watch, before he revived sufficiently to roll overand over in the ferns and rub off some of the mud. Even so, when hereached home he was so smeared and malodorous with mire that, allunwitting of the mortal peril from which he had emerged, we met himwith a scolding, scoured him off with newspapers and shut him out ofdoors for the rest of the day.We grew to dislike the progress of civilization, so much did trains,trolleys, golf-balls and motors add to our anxiety, but his own supremeaversion was, in his early years, the bicycle. On a certain summer day,when a deeper trouble than Sigurd could understand brooded over thehouse, he trotted down to the forbidden center of the town, The Square,in quest of entertainment. As he was crossing, there came upon him fromone side a carriage and from the other a bicycle, whose rider, aCanadian, turned in his flurry the wrong way. Out of the resultantcrash Sigurd sprang to the sidewalk, but the bicycle reeled after himand, in falling, struck him so sharply as to leave a long black bruiseunder one eye. An observer of the collision told us that Sigurd"flashed off toward home like a streak of sulphur." As soon as the doorwas opened in response to his frantic barking, he bolted upstairs andtook refuge under my bed. The household in its grieved pre-occupationforgot all about him, and it was not until evening that he stole downinto the family circle. With a careless glance at the black mark, werebuked him for having a smutty face. The wistful look of themisunderstood came into those amber eyes, but he comforted himself witha belated dinner and waited for Time to tell his story. The bruiselasted long and the fright still longer. More than a year laterJoy-of-Life and I were driving through the tranquillities of an Indiansummer afternoon, with Sigurd, by this time a strong and rapid runner,far ahead. Suddenly we saw him tearing back in terror. Without waitingfor us to pull up, he bounded over the wheel into the phaeton andpressed his shaking body close against our knees. As we drove on, welooked to right and left for the hippogrif that had so appalled him,and presently beheld it,--a riderless bicycle leaning against a gardenwall.THE HEART OF A DOG    Where did they learn    The miracle of love,    These dogs that turn    From food and sleep at our light-whistled call,    Eager to fling    Their all    Of speed and grace into glad following?    Not the wolf pack    Taught savage instinct love,    For there to lack    The power to slay was to be hunger-slain;    Once down, a prey,    A stain    Of crimson on the snow, a tuft of gray.    Was it from us    They learned such loyal love    Magnanimous,    Meeting our injuries with trustful eyes?    Are we so true,    So wise,    So broken-hearted when love's day is through?    Where did they learn    The miracle of love?    Though beauty burn    In rainbow, foam and flame, these have not heard,    Nor trees and flowers,    That word.    Only our dogs would give their lives for ours.HOME STUDIES    "Thou know'st whate'er I see, read, learn,      Related to thy species, friend,    I tell thee, hoping it may turn    To thine advantage--so attend."    --Caroline Bowles Southey's _Conte ? Mon Chien_.In pursuance of this curriculum, while Joy-of-Life sat on the floorbeside Sigurd for a good-night brush of his gleaming coat, I would readto them from any canine classic that chanced to be at hand,--_Rab andHis Friends_, _Bobby of Greyfriars_, _My Dogs of the Northland_, _TheCall of the Wild_, _Bob_, _Son of Battle_, John Muir's vivid story ofhis Stickeen, Maeterlinck's brooding biography of his Pelleas with thebulging forehead of Socrates, or De Amicis' touching account of hisblessed mongrel, Dick. When Sigurd grew restless under his toilet andwanted to jump up and play, we would tell him how the great dog Kitmer,the only animal besides Balaam's ass and the camel that carried Mahometon his flight from Mecca to be admitted into the Moslem paradise, had"stretched forth his forelegs" for three hundred years in the mouth ofa cave, mounting guard over the Seven Sleepers.Joy-of-Life, who was an historian as well as an economist and hadwritten, despite the annoyance of being confined to the same set ofdates and dynasties, three histories of England, would reach down fromher book shelves some high authority and read us, perhaps, Plutarch'sreport of the watchdog, Cipparus, who guarded the temple of ?sculapiusat Athens so well that when a thief slipped off with some of theprecious offerings, he went after in unrelenting pursuit. "First, theman pelted him with stones, but Cipparus would not give up. When daycame, he kept at a little distance, but followed with his eye on theman and, when the fellow threw him food, would not touch it. When theman lay down, he spent the night by him; when he walked again, the doggot up and kept following. Cipparus fawned on any wayfarers he met, butkept barking at the thief. When the authorities, who were in chase,heard of this from people who had met the pair and who described thecolor and size of the dog, they pursued with yet more zeal, seized theman and brought him back from Crommyon. The dog turned round and ledthe way, proud and delighted, evidently claiming that _he_ had caughtthe temple thief."Another evening it would be Motley's account of the escape of thePrince of Orange from a night raid sent out by the Duke of Alva, whenthe Prince was encamped near Mons. "The sentinels were cut down, thewhole army surprised, and for a moment powerless, while, for two hourslong, from one o'clock in the morning until three, the Spaniardsbutchered their foes, hardly aroused from their sleep, ignorant by howsmall a force they had been thus suddenly surprised, and unable in theconfusion to distinguish between friend and foe. The boldest, led byJulian in person, made at once for the Prince's tent. His guards andhimself were in profound sleep, but a small spaniel, who always passedthe night upon his bed, was a more faithful sentinel. The creaturesprang forward, barking furiously at the sound of hostile footsteps,and scratching his master's face with his paws. There was but just timefor the Prince to mount a horse which was ready saddled, and to effecthis escape through the darkness, before his enemies sprang into thetent. His servants were cut down, his master of the horse and two ofhis secretaries, who gained their saddles a moment later, all losttheir lives, and but for the little dog's watchfulness, William ofOrange, upon whose shoulders the whole weight of his country's fortunesdepended, would have been led within a week to an ignominious death. Tohis dying day, the Prince ever afterwards kept a spaniel of the samerace in his bed-chamber."And well he might, and well, too, did the sculptors place a little dogof marble or bronze at the feet of his royal statues hardly more silentthan himself, but what Sigurd and I clamored to know was whether, onthat wild night of September eleventh, 1572, the spaniel escaped withhis master or died with the servants and secretaries on Spanish steel,and no historian, not even our own, could tell us. With the ancientguile of teachers she would divert our attention from the question shecould not answer by relating something else,--how Denmark commemoratesa dog true to a deposed king in a high order of nobility whose mottoruns, _Wild-brat was faithful_. Or she would take down the first volumeof her well-worn _Heimskringla_ and excite Sigurd's young ambition bythe record of King Saur. For when Eyestein, King of the Uplands, hadharried Thrandheim and set his son over them, and they had slain theson, then "King Eyestein fared a-warring the second time intoThrandheim, and harried wide there, and laid folk under him. Then hebade the Thrandheimers choose whether they would have for king histhrall, who was called Thorir Faxi, or his hound, who was called Saur;and they chose the second, deeming they would then the rather do theirown will. Then let they bewitch into the hound the wisdom of three men,and he barked two words and spake the third. A collar was wrought forhim, and chains of gold and silver; and whenso the ways were miry, hiscourtmen bare him on their shoulders. A high-seat was dight for him,and he sat on howe as kings do; he dwelt at the Inner Isle, and had hisabode at the stead called Saur's Howe. And so say folk that he came tohis death in this wise, that the wolves fell on his flocks and herds,and his courtmen egged him on to defend his sheep; so he leaped downfrom his howe, and went to meet the wolves, but they straightway torehim asunder."On the whole, Sigurd preferred poetry, whose rhythm promptly put him tosleep. It was all one to him whether Homer sang the joy-broken heart ofold Argus, over whom                "the black night of death    Came suddenly, as soon as he had seen    Ulysses, absent now for twenty years,"or Virgil chanted the device whereby ?neas and the Sibyl baffled thegiant watch-dog of Hades.    "The three-mouthed bark of Cerberus here filleth all the place,    As huge he lieth in a den that hath them full in face;    But when the adders she beheld upon his crest up-borne,    A sleepy morsel honey-steeped and blent of wizard's corn,    She cast him: then his three-fold throat, all wild with hunger's lack,    He opened wide, and caught at it, and sank his monstrous back,    And there he lay upon the earth enormous through the cave."Sigurd would softly thump his tail in cadence with the melancholy beatof a dog elegy, whether Prior's tribute to the virtues of Queen Mary'sTrue, or Gay's ironic consolation to Celia on the death of her lap-dogShock, Cowper's impartial epitaphs for My Lord's pointer Neptune and MyLady's spaniel Fop, Lehmann's memorial of his retriever, who    "Chose, since official dogs at times unbend,    The household cat for confidante and friend,"Louise Imogen Guiney's lament for    "All the sweet wavy    Beauty of Davy,"or Winifred Letts' apostrophe to the debonair collie Scott, or HiltonBrown's tenderest of farewells to his Scotch terrier, Hamish.                        "In the nether spaces    Will the soul of a Little Black Dog despair?    Will the Quiet Folk scare him with shadow-faces?    And how will he tackle the Strange Beasts there?    Tail held high, I'll warrant, and bristling,    Marching stoutly if sore afraid,    Padding it steadily, softly whistling;--    That's how the Little Black Devil was made."Sigurd lived too early to take part in the Free Verse controversy, buthe evinced an open mind on matters metrical in that he liked LordByron's inscription for his Newfoundland Boatswain no better than LordEldon's for his Newfoundland C?sar. It was Sir William Watson's famousquatrain, _An Epitaph_, that affected him most keenly, because itinvited emphasis on the one word that always brought him springing tohis feet.    "His friends he loved. His fellest earthly foes      --Cats--I believe he did but feign to hate.    My hand will miss the insinuated nose,      Mine eyes the tail that wagged contempt at Fate."As Sigurd was duly shown _Canis Major_ in the ethereal heavens, so washe introduced to certain starry dogs that shine in the skies of Englishpoetry,--the pampered "smale houndes" of Chaucer's Prioress, KingLear's elegant little "Tray, Blanche, and Sweetheart," dear, clownishCrab, and all that pack of rich-voiced hunting hounds whose "gallantchiding" rings through Elizabethan literature. The boy Will Shakespearemust often have hearkened to the hounds, "match'd in mouth like bells,"coursing the Cotswolds, Silver and Belman and Sweetlips and Echo, theirheads hung "with ears that sweep away the morning dew," the "speed ofthe cry" outrunning his "sense of hearing."Sigurd was but mildly interested when we told him that in GeorgeEliot's novels there were over fifty dogs, ranging all the way from pugto mastiff, nor did he care greatly for Dickens' dogs, not evenblundering, ill-favored, clumsy, "bullet-headed" Diogenes, FlorenceDombey's comforter, nor the bandy leader of Jerry's dancing troupe,who, because of a lost half-penny, had to grind out Old Hundred on thebarrel-organ while his companions devoured their supper--and his; butScott's dogs, from fleet Lufra of _The Lady of the Lake_ to the DandyDinmonts of _Guy Mannering_,--"There's auld Pepper and auld Mustard,and young Pepper and young Mustard, and little Pepper and littleMustard"--made him blink and prick up his ears. Thus encouraged, Iwould tell him of Sir Walter's love for all his home dogs and most ofall for the tall stag-hound Maida; how Herrick wept for his spanielTracy; how Southey grieved when his "poor old friend" Phillis, anotherspaniel, was drowned; how Landor delighted in dogs from the boyhoodwhen he boxed with Captain behind the coach house door to the extremeold age whose loneliness was solaced by two silky-coated Pomeranians,first, in Bath, by the golden Pomero, who would bark an ecstaticaccompaniment to his master's tremendous explosions of laughter, andthen, in Florence, by Giallo, whose opinions on politics and lettersthe snowy-bearded poet would quote with humorous respect; how Nero, aMaltese fringy-paws, brightened the somber home of the Carlyles; andhow Pope's favorite dog was, as he bitterly suggests, not unlikehimself in being "a little one, a lean one, and none of the finestshaped." If Sigurd seemed responsive, I might go on with accounts ofMrs. Browning's Flush; of Hogg's Hector, "auld, towzy, trusty friend";of Arnold's dachshunds, Geist, Max and Kaiser; of Gilder's Leo,    "Leo the shaggy, the lustrous, the giant, the gentle Newfoundland,"of Lehman's "flop-eared" Rufus, and of Miss Letts' terrier Tim in his"wheaten-colored coat."Lest Sigurd should get the impression that the globe was populatedchiefly by poets, Joy-of-Life would strike in with anecdotes of thelittle dogs that frisked about Frederick the Great, and Charles II, theMerry Monarch, and tell how Edward VII's last pet, C?sar, a foxterrier, trotted mournfully in the funeral procession behind Kildare,the royal charger; or she would "unmuzzle her wisdom" to the point ofdeclaring that the kings of Babylon and Nineveh had their favoritehunting hounds with tails curled up over the back and collars wroughtin the form of leafy wreaths. She would inform Sigurd, who took itflippantly, that solemn burial honors had been paid to dogs in ancienttimes, that the Egyptians held them sacred and religiously embalmedtheir bodies, and that many a Celtic chief and Norland viking lies morequiet beneath his cairn because his noblest deerhound slumbers at hisfeet. Or perhaps she would relate, for our collie's ethical guidance,celebrated deeds of hero dogs. Sigurd would grunt and grumble insympathy with her deep tones as she chanted the famous ballad of BethG?lert, that "peerless hound" whose fidelity cost him his life, or ofthe twice-sung terrier, haunter of Helvellyn, who for three months keptwatch beside her master's body at the foot of the fatal precipice.Sigurd did not care for Wordsworth as much as Wordsworth would havecared for him, but he loved Little Music, striving in vain to save herfellow Dart under whose speed the river-ice had broken.On one of those fortunate evenings when we had the Dryad with us,Sigurd would listen with waxing incredulity to legends of King Arthur'shound Cavall, whose paw left its print on British rock; of Merlin'sdemon dog, black with red ears, akin to the little black dog thatdanced about Faustus, sending out flying flames from its feet; ofFingal's Bran and his last chase after the enchanted snow-white hart;and of Tristram's faithful Hodain, who licked the dregs from the cup oflove which the knight and Queen Iseult had quaffed together. Sigurd wasfrankly skeptical about those    "Half a hundred good ban-dogs"of Fountains Abbey, who, whistled to his help by the fighting friar,gave Robin Hood and his archers not a little trouble.    "Two dogs at once to Robin Hood did go,      T'one behind, the other before;    Robin Hood's mantle of Lincoln green      Off from his back they tore.    "And whether his men shot east or west,      Or they shot north or south,    The curtal dogs, so taught they were,      They caught the arrows in their mouth."But Petit-Crin, the fairy dog from Avalon that Tristram gave to Iseult,was more than any honest collie could endure."No tongue could tell the marvel of it; 'twas of such wondrous fashionthat no man might say of what color it was. If one looked on thebreast, and saw naught else, one had said 'twas white as snow, yet itsthighs were greener than clover, and its sides, one red as scarlet, theother more yellow than saffron. Its under parts were even as azure,while above 'twas mingled, so that no one color might be distinguished;'twas neither green nor red, white nor black, yellow nor blue, and yetthere was somewhat of all these therein; 'twas a fair purple brown. Andif one saw this strange creation of Avalon against the lie of the hairthere would be no man wise enough to tell its color, so manifold andchanging were its hues."Around its neck was a golden chain, and therefrom hung a bell, whichrang so sweet and clear when it began to chime Tristram forgot hissadness and his sorrow, and the longing for Iseult that lay heavy athis heart. So sweet was the tone of the bell that no man heard it buthe straightway forgat all that aforetime had troubled him."Tristram hearkened, and gazed on this wondrous marvel; he took note ofthe dog and the bell, the changing colors of the hair, and the sweetsound of the chimes; and it seemed to him that the marvel of the dogwas greater than that of the music which rang in his ears, and banishedall thought of sorrow."He stretched forth his hand and stroked the dog, and it seemed to himthat he handled the softest silk, so fine and so smooth was the hair tohis touch. And the dog neither growled, nor barked, nor showed any signof ill temper, however one might play with it; nor, as the tale goes,was it ever seen to eat or to drink."At this point, Sigurd rose, shook himself and stalked out to thekitchen. He could bear a great deal from his pedantic mistresses, butthere were limits. Satiated with history and literature, he proposed torelax his mind by a turn at psychology.From Cecilia's successor, Ellen, Sigurd was taking a brief but vividcourse in psychics. To be sure, a _bona fide_ professor in that fielddwelt near us, her high-picketed fence enclosing a baker's dozen ofspaniels. It was understood, to the awe of the community, that by theiraid she investigated certain dark corners of her shadowy subject;but Sigurd, embarrassed by the attentions thrust upon him by thegrandmother of the spaniel family, rested content with his unacademictutor."Poor Ellen," as she invariably called herself, was a small, wiry,nut-brown Irish woman, whose gray hair rose erect, as if justaffrighted by pouke or pixy, from above a constantly wrinkling foreheadand a pair of snapping jet eyes. She must have been on the borders ofinsanity, if not across, when she came to us. She was a furious worker,cycloning about the house with mop and broom at all hours and nothesitating to upbraid the college president herself, most benign andpunctilious of ladies, if her boots brought one speck of mud into "PoorEllen's clane hall." Her chief pride, however, was in her frugality, aswe discovered to our dismay on her second afternoon, when, as it oftenhappily chanced, the Dryad, then living on the campus, dropped in for acall and consented to remain for dinner.It was a simple matter, in our informal way of life, to call back fromthe piazza through the hall to the figure setting the table in thedining room:"Lay another plate, please, Ellen. Our friend stays to dine with us."But the wail that succeeded nearly slew our friend by throwing her intoan agony of suppressed laughter."Mother of God! Isn't that the burning shame! And me maning the threechops should do us all!"Ellen had been with us but a few days, though the house was already soscoured and polished that we scarcely dared set foot on our own floors,when a prolonged season of sultry weather broke in a tremendousthunderstorm. These thunderstorms were always a challenge to Sigurd'svalor. At the first crash he would pluckily make for the porch, where,flinging up his head, he would cast back one defiant bark to thatSuperdog in the skies; then, scared by his own audacity, he wouldusually bolt upstairs and take refuge under a bed. But this time hefled, with the second shattering peal, to Ellen, who was rockingherself, a crouching, huddled figure, to and fro on the cellar stairs,screaming in a weird, blood-curdling chant:"Mercy of God! Poor Ellen belaves in God the Father and in the HolyMother of God and in all the blissid saints of heaven. Oh, grace ofMary! Poor Ellen belaves in thim all. Good Lord, you never kilt PoorEllen yet and you wouldn't be after doing it now whin her bones be oldand her heart a nest of sorrows. The Lord look down in pity on thepoor."With Sigurd hugged tight, Ellen's shrieks gradually sank into sob andmoan, and from that hour he was her one confidante and comrade. Noteven in him would she allow the least untidiness, but would fly to meethim at the threshold, picking up each paw in turn and manicuring it inher apron, and would insist, despite our remonstrances, in squattingdown outside the back door and feeding his dinner to him, bit by bit,lest "Gobble-mouth" drop crumbs and gravy on "Poor Ellen's clanegravel."Sigurd found this fellowship at his meals so entrancing that he wouldeat even baked beans from Ellen's lean brown fingers and would takeadvantage of her society to get twice as much dinner as was good forhim. When his dish was empty and polished bright, under Ellen'sapproving eye, by his circling tongue, he would promenade dolefullyabout the kitchen, peering with an air of deep dejection into coal hodand wood basket, as if he were starved to a diet of cinders andkindlings, well aware that behind his back Ellen was heaping his dishanew. Her excess of thrift, from which our own table suffered, wasnever brought to bear on Sigurd.As he ate, she would tell him long stories of her childhood in hungryIreland and of her hard, bewildered, wandering life in the Land ofPromise. Only once was I guilty of pausing by the kitchen door tolisten."It was the place afore this, Darlint, or maybe the place afore that,or maybe another, that Old Goldtooth wedded my widow woman and took herto New York for the shows. He'd been drinking more than a drop the dayand he says, 'Let's bring Poor Ellen along, for the fun of it. You canlend her your second-best bonnet, for there's money to buy more in NewYork.' But it wasn't her second-best, nor yet her third, the comicalthing she set on me. To a hotel in New York he took us and a grand feedhe gave us. Thin off to the show they wint, and he put a newspaper inmy hand, and opened up at a page with niver a picture on it, and hetold me to sit there like a lady and read about Boarding Houses. Sothere was Poor Ellen all that avening, and long it was as a rosary ofnights, holding up that paper, with the quare letters, all sizes,dancing over it, and reading about Boarding Houses. But whin they cameback--O Darlint, the saints defind us!--he told me it was about theBorden Murder I'd been reading, not Boarding Houses at all, and PoorEllen not sensing a scratch of it, or sure she'd been scared into afit. Don't let thim tache you to read their books, Darlint, for surethere's no knowing what the black words might be saying."But although this is the only outpouring of Ellen's confidence toSigurd at which I played eavesdropper, too often her mad screecheswould bring us pell-mell into the kitchen where we would find the twoof them wrought to a state of highest excitement. Once Sigurd, lying atfull length, was squeezing a hollow rubber ball between his lips,making it emit harrowing squeaks that Ellen, hopping grotesquely up anddown, identified as the cries of an imprisoned banshee. Another timeshe had one arm clasped about Sigurd's neck and with the other hand waspounding her little alarm clock on the floor, entreating him, "Bite thefeaver whin it jumps out, Darlint. A year ago by this clock it was thatPoor Ellen had the feaver and died and she has been in the Fire eversince."Again we heard sounds of scuffling and struggle, punctuated bydesperate screams from Ellen and furious barks from Sigurd. The kitchenwas in a whirlwind, but Ellen was presently calmed enough to explain tous in terrified gasps that the demons were trying to drag her away fromthe throne of God and that she had set Sigurd on her tormentors. Ourgallant collie evidently drove off the fiends, for Ellen's passion ofresistance suddenly ceased and, sinking to the floor, she hid herconvulsed face in Sigurd's ruff, wailing, "But next time they'll getme. Poor Ellen! Poor Ellen! It's a sore and sorry life she's had, andto come to the Pain in the end!"On the last night of Ellen's stay with us,--for we had arranged,without telling her, to have the crazy old creature transferred to theoffice of a friendly physician, where her prowess with thescrubbing-brush would be appreciated and her mental peculiarities beunder wise and humane observation--an ear-splitting yell once moresummoned us post-haste to the kitchen. Sigurd, erect on rigid legs, wasstaring with an uncanny fixity of gaze on vacancy, while Ellen, on herknees, wringing her hands above her head, was alternately abjuring himand Heaven."O Darlint, is it my death ye're after seeing now? Is it Poor Ellenwith the candles at head and feet? Och, let me go! I lave this houseto-night. It's not Poor Ellen will bide with a dog does be looking ather own ghost.""Nonsense, Ellen!" protested Joy-of-Life, interposing her strong,wholesome presence between the distracted old woman and the outsidedoor. "There are no ghosts here. Sigurd is only looking at the wall.Perhaps he heard a rat or a mouse in there.""_Ouch!_" shrilled Ellen, dodging out of the door in a fresh paroxysmof fright. "Rats and mice is it! Rats and mice do be the black spiritscome to gnaw out our brains. And here they've come for Poor Ellen'swits. They chase Poor Ellen wherever she goes. But she'll give thim theslip on the morrow."While Joy-of-Life brought Ellen in, quieted her with malted milk andsent her to bed, I puzzled over Sigurd, whose staring eyes andbristling hair still gave evidence of something we could not discern.Other observers of dog conduct have testified to occurrences of thiskind, as, very recently, the master of a red cocker spaniel (Walter E.Carr in _The Story of Five Dogs_) and from far antiquity the Arabs, whohold that a dog can see the wings of the Angel of Death hovering overthe one for whom Azrael has been sent.Ellen came down in the morning, still determined on departure andentirely content with the place we had secured for her. All that daythrough she was her most cleanly, thrifty and cheerful self. Nothingwould do but she must sweep the whole house from attic to cellar,especially scouring her own room until it was pure enough for Diana.Pleased with the bustle of packing and getting off, evidently anhabitual state of things with Poor Ellen, she graced her farewell witha flourish of economical courtesies. She presented Joy-of-Life with abanana which she had blarneyed from our Italian fruit-vender, and gaveme a little jar of cream, begged or bullied from the milkman in theearly dawn. As for Sigurd, she made him a square foot of his favoritecorn bread and hung a Catholic medal to his collar. She went off in thebest of humor, greatly set up by her own cleverness in having been ableto make, so cheaply, such suitable good-by gifts. When the expressmancame for her shabby, bulging bag, she treated him to such a nice littleluncheon of cookies and lemonade that he offered her a ride to thestation. From the driver's lofty seat she waved us a queenly adieu,calling back: "The Lord loves Poor Ellen, after all." Sigurd ran withthe wagon as far as the corner. The last we saw of his psychicinstructor, she was kissing her workworn hands to him and shrillingback endearments.THE PLEADERS    Before the Majesty of Most High God      The gentlest of the glad Archangels came;    Swift down the emerald avenue he trod,      His eager sandals quivering to flame.    Close at his heels there frisked a dog, his mate      In bygone journeyings with young Tobias,    A dog "without," whose love had dared the gate,      Scenting the steps of Brother Azarias,    So-called in those blithe morns when, laughing-eyed,      By thorn and myrrh, the dew on every stem,    He led the son of Tobit to his bride,      And the lad's dog went leaping after them.    The little winds that in those sunrise-flushed,      Fleet plumes had nestled, to the harpstrings flew    To learn gold melodies for May, but hushed      Was all that glory till a Voice pealed through:    "Mine Angel Raphael, of the Holy Seven      Who lift the prayers of saints before the Throne,    What wild, unworded anguish troubles Heaven,      To man's appeal the wailing undertone?    Men's orisons for Peace, for Peace, for Peace,      Smothered the psalms of Paradise, until    I bade that vain and bitter crying cease.      My will is Peace. Let mortals do my will."    Before the shining of the Mercy Seat      The Angel raised a censer. "Lord, I bring    The screams of shell-torn horses, thrashing feet      Of mangled mules, the pigeon's broken wing,    Gasping of dogs gas-tortured, wounds and woe      Of myriad creatures by Thy breath endowed    With being. Theirs the prayers that overflow      This vessel by whose weight my heart is bowed."    Ah, strange to see that poor, vague incense rise,      Dim supplication crossed by fragrances    Of courage, faithfulness, self-sacrifice      Even of these brute martyrs, even of these.    "Brother of Sorrows, bear to man those groans      Of a creation that I fashioned well    And gave to his dominion,--man, who owns      One morning star to make it heaven or hell.    I am but God, a Pity throned above      To watch the sparrow's fall, to feel its throes    And wait the slow, sweet blossoming of love,      Small, kindly loves from which the Great Love grows."    Then Raphael, Healer of the Earth, bowed thrice,      Withdrawing through the ranks of seraphim    Who smiled to see how, scorning Paradise,      On frolic feet the dog sped after him.COLLEGE CAREER    "Thy faith is all the knowledge that thou hast."    --Jonson's _Epigrams_, XVIII.Whatever may be thought of Sigurd's college career, there can be nodoubt that he careered through college. He was at the top of bliss in amad run over the campus. With streaming ruff and tail he would rush onlike Lelaps, the wild hound of Cephalus on the trail of the monstrousfox sent by a slighted goddess to harass the Thebans and, like Lelapswhen the Olympians chose to make the chase eternal by turning both dogand fox to stone, Sigurd would come to a sudden stop on the brow of ahill, standing out against the sky like a collie statue poised forrunning.Joy-of-Life could cross the broad meadow almost as lightly and swiftlyas he and their morning pilgrimages to chapel were expeditions of highglory. There were hundreds of girls abroad at that hour and oftenSigurd would wheel from the path and dash jubilantly toward any figurethat took his fancy, confident of welcome. But if the individualchanced to be a new freshman, not yet acquainted with the collegedignitaries, she might meet his advances with fear or annoyance or astill more cutting indifference. Then Sigurd would droop thoseexpectant ears of his and return with dignity to his forsaken comrade.If his greeting were properly reciprocated, he would ramp joyously uponhis fellow student and prance about her, leaping to the height of hershoulders in his ecstasy of good-will.His favorite laboratory was Lake Waban. In the summer afternoons hewould tease to have us both escort him up for his swim and if on theway we tried to part company, one or the other turning aside for a morepressing errand, Sigurd would herd us with ancestral art, jumping uponthe deserter and gently pushing her back, or standing in the path toblock her progress, protesting all the while with coaxing whines, withexpostulary barks and with all manner of collie eloquence. If wewalked, on the other hand, close together, absorbed in talk, he wouldjealously push in between us, as he often did when we were having afireside t?te-?-t?te or bidding each other good night. He wished us tounderstand that Sigurd was the one to be loved and that all affectionsnot directed toward Sigurd were superfluous. But when we both acceptedhis invitation to the lake, the three hundred acres of the college parkhardly sufficed for his antics. Curveting about us till he seemed to beten collies at once, flashing in ever widening circles over the leveland over the slopes, bounding upon us with a storm of gleeful sneezes,he would lead the way to Sigurd's Tub, as he considered it. If some onefell in with us and joined us on the walk, Sigurd, always of courteousinstinct, would drop back and follow demurely, or amuse himself at adecorous distance by investigating holes, chasing squirrels andstriving with wild springs, scrambles, clawings, to climb the treesfrom whose boughs they mocked his clumsy efforts. But how rejoiced hewould be when the interloper turned off! "There! Gone at last! Now we_will_ have fun, all by ourselves!" Then he would cast about for somedoughty deed to do, longing to dazzle us by a prodigious feat ofstrength and skill. If he could find a young tree that our tooefficient forestry had cut down he would drag it along, bite and breakaway its branches, seize it by the middle and balance it in his mouthas a long pole, constantly lifting his bright eyes to us foradmiration.Once arrived at the lake, it was our duty to find sticks and fling themout over the water to the extent of our strength, while Sigurd swam forthem, the farther the better. As he would gallantly splash up from theshallows and, stick in mouth, climb the bushy bank, we had to run fromthe mighty shaking with which, delivering the prize, he loved to giveus a shower-bath. After a few such plunges, Sigurd, while we rested onthe bank, would appropriate the green apron of Mother Earth for atowel, rolling over and over on the turf to dry himself and completingthe process by scampers in the sun. He disliked being wet, for althoughthese swims in the lake ranked among his prime delights, at home healways resented and resisted a bath and, on a showery day, would oftenrun in to the towel rack, pleading to be wiped dry, and would thenforthwith run out into the rain again. In our hottest weather he wouldslip off alone in the early morning to that still lake all sweet withwater-lilies and would be gone for hours. A few times, in his youngeryears, our anxiety took us by mid-day to the shore, whence we would seea yellow head well out in the water. At our whistle, Sigurd would turnand swim back to us with an air of surprise and pleasure as if he hadquite forgotten that such dear friends were to be found on land. Theoutcome was not so happy when, tormented in his fur coat by the heat,he had stolen off to one of his secret mire-pits and indulged in a coolwallow. When he came home plastered and perfumed from head to tail, wewould greet him with exclamations of disgust, which brought the Byronicmelancholy into his eyes, hustle him off to the rocks behind the house,fling pailfuls of warm water over him and do our best to scrape off hispollutions. On one of these occasions, a college-girl lover and Wallaceraced him up to Waban and scrubbed and rinsed him until, so they said,the entire lake had changed color.In the autumn term Sigurd would take a special course in harvesting,frisking through a neighboring orchard and playing ball with thefalling apples. The winter term he gave mainly to athletics anddramatics. How bewildered he was that first snowy morning when he ranout into a strange white ravine bounded by slippery walls and when,desperately lunging over one of these, he felt himself floundering in adrift! His first dubious venture on a crackling sheet of ice taxed hispuppy courage, too, but he persisted in his quivering progress acrossour little Longfellow Pond and swaggered up the further side with hisjauntiest sporting air. In later years he enjoyed nothing better thangoing skating with Lady Blanche, another member of our changefulhousehold, and on a stinging January morning he would outdo thefrolics, that Cowper smiled to watch, of the dog who                                "with many a frisk    Wide scampering, snatches up the drifted snow    With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;    Then shakes his powder'd coat, and barks for joy."As for dramatics, Sigurd loved to thrust his stick deep into a pile ofrusset leaves or sparkling snow, and then pretend that he was asanguinary monster whose prey had escaped him, and dig and nose andscrape and scatter and tear and shuffle with frenzied energy, rumblingall the while growls of awful menace, until he had tossed it up toseize and worry, display to the audience always requisite for theseperformances, and then bury it again for a repetition of the melodrama.When the winter storms kept him in, his surging vitality made him asrestless as an imprisoned wind. If the Cave of ?olus boasted ahousekeeper, she had our sympathy. All day long Sigurd would scoot andspin about the little range of rooms that we liked to have quiet andorderly, a very electric battery of mischief. He would pick quarrelswith the rugs, scatter the pile of newspapers and dance a scandalousjig with that elderly, respectable Bostonian, _The Transcript_. Hewould bump into a gracefully leaning broom and a meditative mop,knocking their wooden wits together and bringing them to the floor withwhat he considered a beautiful bang. He would stir up civil war on thehearth till poker and tongs and dust-brush and bellows all set upon oneanother with hideous clang of combat. At last we would toss over tohim, in desperation, an old pair of rubbers, and he would make love toone and try to swallow the other, playing as many parts as Bottomlonged for, all the way from Pyramus to Lion.A new stage was provided for him when the storm was over and weundertook to shovel the drift off the piazza. He would instantly claimthe star r?le of rival shovel, pawing the powdery heaps with deliriouszest, or he would be the snow itself, ecstatically indignant at beingswept down the steps. He played thrilling tragi-comedies with bones,too, especially with one monstrous knuckle that might have belonged tothe skeleton of Polyphemus, the prize of one of Sigurd's eveningprowls. It was a bitter cold midnight, but our happy rebel, sportingwith that giant joint, tossing it about in the snow, losing it onpurpose, catching its glimmer by grace of the moon and madly pouncingon it once more, would not obey the bed-time whistle. He stretchedhimself out, a saffron blotch on the white, and hugged his treasure,crunching away persuasively to convince us that the clock was wrong andit was still only dinner time. Our ignominious resort, in such a case,was to fetch from a certain pantry box, the daily object of Sigurd'ssupplicating sniffs, a piece of cake, and proceed to eat it, withvulgar smack of ostentatious relish, in the doorway, under the electriclight. As ever, this stratagem brought our mutineer to terms. Givingthe bone a last affectionate lick, he came bounding into the hall intime for the crumbs. But his high spirits were far from spent. Thoughhe consented to play Yellow Caterpillar, curling up in the blanketedround clothes-basket which, for the winter, displaced hisThunder-and-Lightning rug, he barked so often through the small hours,in his dreams or out, that our slumbers were literally curtailed.Rebuked into silence, he gnawed his leash in two, tipped over hisbasket and settled himself for a morning snooze on the forbiddenlounge.It is obvious that Sigurd was not a model of virtue. We did not wanthim so much better than ourselves. "That dog would be improved by agood licking," said Joy-of-Life's visiting elder brother. But with allrespect for elder brothers--my own had nearly hanged Sigurd by aningenious contrivance of ropes and loops designed to enable me tounleash him on a summer morning from my sleeping balcony--we decidedthat we would rather have our collie with all his frolic imperfectionson his head than cowed into slavish obedience. Only once when, hardlyout of puppyhood, he dashed from my side, as we were walking decorouslyon the sidewalk, and danced backward on his hind legs in front of adodging automobile, out-barking its distracted horn, did I attempt towhip him. He had barely escaped with life and limb and, determined toimpress him, for his own safety, with his wrong-doing, I caught him bythe collar, doubled the leash which I still carried but had almostceased to use, and began to beat him with it about the head. Sigurd'sastonished yelp was answered in an instant from the side street wheredwelt the Sisters and, like a white knight of chivalry, Laddie camecharging out, thrusting himself between us, leaping upon me anddemanding, with a wrath seldom seen in his gentle eyes, that I stopmaltreating his twin.Of course the brothers took the chance to run away together. It wasslushy going and when Sigurd came home at seven o'clock, so tired thathe could hardly drag one muddy foot after another, he was in shockingtrim, his white hose and shirt-front soaked to a disreputable gray. Itwas unlucky, for his amateur dramatics were to be crowned that eveningby a public part on the college stage. He was to be Faithful Dog,watching beside his master,--a forgotten hero of the Revolution,--asthat gallant young lieutenant slept away the hour before daybreak, whenhe was to be executed as a spy. At a low whistle of the rescuer beneaththe window, Faithful Dog was to arouse his master by placing a wary pawupon the sleeper's breast and, when the lieutenant had made good hisescape, remain behind to face the angry guard and be shot extremelydead in his master's place. Sigurd had thrown himself into this nobler?le with enthusiasm and rehearsed it several times with distinguishedsuccess.An escort of sophomores had been waiting for him in an agony ofimpatience and, when he at last arrived, there could be no thought ofdinner or a nap. Sigurd was hustled down to the laundry, put throughmerciless ablutions and rushed off to the college barn, our impromptutheater, in the snug little vehicle that our liveryman called his"coop." Three or four girls were sardined in with him, flourishingtowels and doing their best to scrub him dry on the way. But it was aruffled, soapsudsy and excessively drowsy Faithful Dog that trotted outupon the stage, yawned in the face of the rapturous greeting of hiscongregated friends, the Barn Swallows, jumped up on the prison cot,never meant for him, and rolled himself into a solid slumber-ball,refusing to wake, not even so much as blink, from first to last of thedrama. With natural presence of mind, an essential quality in spies,the hero soliloquized to the audience that his Faithful Dog had beendrugged, evoking a round of applause at which Sigurd dreamily flappedhis tail.One r?le that he never could be induced to play was that of Dandy. OneSunday afternoon, when he came limping in with his feet all cut andsore from a morning frisk over rough ice, I dressed them in discardedwhite kid gloves, tying each firmly round the ankle, and started outwith Sigurd for a call on the Dryad. But our sturdy Viking resentedsuch dudish apparel and would flump down, at brief intervals, on thecrusted drifts and tug away at that detested frippery with the resultthat, on his arrival, only the paw he thrust out at his amused hostesswas still elegant in a tatter of white kid.Sigurd believed in elective courses rather than required. There werecertain things that, as a matter of principle, he persistently refusedto learn. Though by nature a dig, as my sister's flower-beds too oftentestified, not her most fervent remonstrances could convince him thatbulbs and bones should not be planted together. His general attitudetoward education was not unique. He had "come to college for the life."From the narrow paths of learning he bounded off in pursuit of a"well-rounded development." His social engagements were numerous andpressing. Often he had not time, between afternoon tea in one dormitoryand a birthday spread in another, to scamper home for the plainparenthesis of a dog-biscuit dinner. Sometimes we would hear ourtruant, in the small hours, drop down upon the porch with a thud ofutter exhaustion, and would learn by degrees, during the next day ortwo, that he had gone with a botany or geology class on a long morningtramp, played hare and hounds with one of the athletic teams all theafternoon and paraded the town till midnight with a serenading party.Often in the spring weather we would not set eyes on him for two daysrunning, or might, perhaps, catch a passing glimpse of our colliestanding expectant on the stone wall by the East Lodge, watching thestream of girls and waiting for his next invitation. He would dutifullygreet us with a bark and a caper and, if we were driving, jump down tofollow the carriage, but if one of his student chums came trippingalong and threw her arms about him, showering kisses on his sunny head,Sigurd would flourish his tail in rapturous response and off the twowould race to "Math." or "Lit." or "Chem." or "Comp." or whatever otherbranch of knowledge Young America cannot spare breath to pronounce.We would often see him lying impartially across the knees of a group ofgirls studying together in some green nook, his plume waving in thefaces clustered over Horace or Livy. He had nothing but admiration forsuch guileless renderings as "The swift hunter pursuing the leper" or"He landed his boats in the sea," and the harder these latter-dayHumanists hugged him, the more he sneezed and yawned in a veryembarrassment of joy, though when, absorbed in subjunctives, theypinched his silky ears a trifle too hard, he would quietly withdraw andhunt up a stick for them to throw for Sigurd. Not all his mates werewise in their good-will. They would pick up and toss, for him to chaseand worry, rough-broken, splintery pieces of painted board or anythingthat came handy, and presently a lugubrious dog would appear before hisfamily, laying at our feet, perhaps, a well-licked strip of picketfence, and lifting for our ministrations a bleeding mouth, where thered was mingled with a stain of sickly green.Sigurd took all manner of liberties even with seniors. At home, thoughhe would gaze into the refrigerator with deep interest, he neverventured to insert so much as his nose, and though a dish of candiesmight be standing on a low table easily in reach, he merely looked andwaggled. Only once, on a Tophet-hot afternoon, while a guest, absorbedin talk, sat oblivious of the plate of ice-cream melting on her knee,did Sigurd slip in his craving tongue and accelerate the process. Butwith the college girls he knew no such restraints. He was familiar withall their chafing-dish corners and, entering by any door he found ajar,he would help himself to a lunch of fudge and wafers before lookingabout to choose the softest heap of couch cushions for his nap. When acut foot made walking painful, he would prevail upon the girls to carryhim, great fellow that he was, and we would sometimes come upon himdangling across a slender hand-chair, while his panting bearersstruggled up the hill to College Hall. On seeing us, he would scrambledown and sheepishly make off with an exaggerated limp. Once we chancedon a group of freshmen holding a picnic party with King Sigurdenthroned on a mossy log in the center, his gilt-paper crown tippedrakishly over one eye. He delighted in picnics, cross-country walks,the May-day frolic on the campus, and constantly imperiled his life byfrisking about on tennis court, golf links and archery fields. Thegirls would use him as a postman, sending him from one to another withnotes, not always delivered, swinging from his collar, and he oftenappeared at the door of a college fair or other festivity wearing theticket which some lavish chum had bought for him. He was about thecollege grounds and buildings so much that we feared he might become anuisance, as well as depart from the few principles of collie conductwe had labored to instill. Much to his indignation, therefore, we madehim address to the students, through the columns of our little collegeweekly,    A DOGGEREL PETITION    Sigurd begs to say to his friends    That for certain inscrutable ends,    Quite apart from his own sweet way,    There are laws he ought to obey;    And because the sight of a girl    Puts the tip of his tail in a curl,    And sends, with a pit-a-pat start,    The commandments out of his heart,    He has to entreat you should    All help poor Sigurd be good.    'Tisn't easy to choke one's barks,    With squirrels making remarks;    'Tisn't easy to travel home    With girls enticing to roam.    All nice things seem to be naughty;    So it's not that Sigurd's grown haughty,    When he meets you at eve on the meadow,    A yellow scud in the shadow,    And passes your grocery bag    With only a wistful wag.    The New Year's good resolutions,    If broken, bring retributions;    So Sigurd beseeches--'tis hard--    That you shouldn't call him off guard;    Nor tempt that inquisitive rover,    That affectionate follower, over    The threshold of College Hall;    Nor let him trustfully sprawl    In the pathway of many feet.    And don't, though the sin is sweet,    Don't, for the gleam of his eyes,    His expectant ears' uprise,    For his nose's coaxing nudge,    Feed Sigurd infinite fudge.That helped him through with one generation of college girls, but afterthree or four years a fresh appeal had to be made, especially in viewof the fact that Sigurd had suddenly resumed the dangerous trick, firsttaken up on his wild scampers with Laddie, of jumping at horses' heads,and we found some of his younger classmates, for Sigurd belonged toevery class in turn, encouraging him in it, because he was "so pretty"in his leaps. Hence once more he reluctantly lapsed into verse andrecommended to his intimates    A NOSTRUM FOR SIGURD    It is wrong to spring      At a horse's nose;    At that quivery thing    It is wrong to spring.    With tail for a wing      I may chase the crows,    But 'tis wrong to spring      At a horse's nose.    Call me back from the horses      With _no_, _no_, _noes_;    When I try snap courses    Call me back from the horses.    Though my remorse is      A transient pose,    Call me back from the horses      With _no_, _no_, _noes_.    I'm only a collie,      As Wellesley knows;    Though ever so jolly    I'm only a collie.    Save Sigurd from folly,      For folly has foes,    And I'm only a collie,      As Wellesley knows.There was a perilous season, after a village Airedale had unadvisedlynipped a teasing small boy, when our hysterical local legislationordered all dogs into muzzles, commanding the police to shoot at sightany canine wayfarer not so equipped. Sigurd, of course, detested hismuzzle and though he would sulkily fetch it when he saw us making readyfor a walk, he would growl at it and worry it until we had it snappedon, when he would often turn mournfully back from the door or lie downbefore it literally in flat rebellion, rather than take the air undersuch humiliating and uncomfortable conditions. He soon began toexercise his ingenuity, however, in the getting rid of thatencumbrance, and again and again, having gone forth a model ofcompliance with the law, he would come bounding back, muzzleless,triumphant, expecting congratulations. It was hard to find a make ofmuzzle that he could not push off with his paws or scrape off under afence or rub off between close-growing trees, and impossible to findone that he could not coax his compassionate girl-chums to take off forhim. Melted by his pleading whines, they would slip the muzzle downfrom his jaws so that he wore it as a pendant over his white vest, acompromise that perplexed our honest college policeman, who, Sigurd'sneighbor and friend, solved the problem by consistently turning hisback and refusing to see the dog at all. But one well-nigh fatal day aspecial officer, called in by our stern selectmen for the purpose ofhunting down all lawless dogs, beheld Sigurd disporting himself in thepublic road, his muzzle, as so often, gayly flapping under his chin.According to the man's bewildered account, no sooner had he drawn hisrevolver and taken good aim at the offender, than "a mob of girls,coming from nowhere and everywhere," suddenly enveloped his intendedvictim and swept the dog off in their midst to the campus. But theofficer had a determined jaw of his own. He kept watch for that fawncollie and the next time he caught sight of Sigurd, again with aswinging muzzle, he ran a rope through our poor boy's collar and wasdragging him off to the town lockup and execution ground when again anexcited throng of nymphs blocked the way."How can you be so cruel?" blazed one of Sigurd's fondest playmates, asa dozen arms were thrown about the collie."I'm no rougher with that there dog than he is with me," protested theyoung officer, purple not only through embarrassment but from the tugof war in which he and Sigurd had been matching strength. "He may beyour college pet, but his manners ain't no-way ladylike."Meanwhile one of the girlish hands caressing Sigurd's neck must havesucceeded in slipping a buckle, for suddenly his head shot back throughthe collar, left as a keepsake to the dog-catcher, and our innocent wasfar on his way toward the safe shelter of home.This period of persecution extended over some months, for the muzzleshad a bad effect on dog tempers and there were more cases of snappingand nipping than the town, in Sigurd's lifetime, had ever known, thoughno trace of rabies was detected. It was an anxious season fordog-owners. Our neighboring professor of psychology, she whospecialized in spaniels, was overheard by a guest one evening wearilyinforming a new litter of eight:"Puppies, this has been a sad day. This morning your ma bit thepostman, and this afternoon your pa bit the doctor."It was a relief to many households when at last the selectmen put theirminds on something else.Although Sigurd was a member of all classes, as well as faculty, and ofall societies, he bore, as mascot, a special relation to the Class of1911, whose color he wore by grace of nature. Glorious he was to beholdon Field Day, his coat, well brushed for the occasion, glistening inthe sun, a great bow of yellow ribbon standing out like a butterflyfrom the top of his collar, wagging all over with joyousself-importance as he stood in the front rank of his class, impartiallybarking applause for both their triumphs and defeats.With him, as with the girls, the spring term was the climax of thecollege year, though not precisely an academic climax. Sigurd stillfound time to drop in at a lecture occasionally, flumping down besidesome favorite fellow-student for a brief repose and rousing now andthen to thrust up a sentimental paw for a shake. But he had manyclass-meetings to attend, where, when "Further Remarks" were calledfor, he has been known to respond with a loud bark,--a recognizedindecorum in the college buildings. But on the whole, he kept the rulessave in so far as he might be considered "a musical instrument" in use"out of recreation hours."The spring term bloomed out in guests like crocuses and Sigurd made apoint of attending as many as possible of the luncheons and teas givenin their honor. An English lady, a poet and a visionary, a presencelike a flame, was one afternoon addressing a choice assemblage in ouroriental parlor on the mysteries of the Bahist faith. A torch-bearer ofthe Persian prophet, she was telling of her first interview with AliBaha on Mount Carmel."And the Master greeted me thus: 'O Child of the Kingdom!'"----_Bump_ went something against the door, which swung wide, admittingSigurd, who saluted the company with a comprehensive wave of his tail."You beautiful creature!" cried the Englishwoman, winning him to herwith an outstretched hand, "I am sure _you_ are a Child of theKingdom," and Sigurd wagged, came up for a pat and dropped down at herfeet to slumber out the rest of her impassioned discourse, wakingpromptly with the arrival of refreshments.But our Child of the Kingdom, on the very day after he had receivedthis accolade, came home to dinner, for which he had no appetite, notonly with a deep scratch, inflicted by the claw of some profane,anti-Bahist cat, down one side of his face, but with his white andgolden hair all matted in brown streaks and patches, in witness that afreshman saucepan had spilled its fudge upon him. Where he could get athimself to lick, he enjoyed it very much, but he was deplorably stickyon top.In the spring, too, there were more dogs about the campus, and battleswere frequent. In the interests of academic fellowship we did our bestto steer Sigurd clear of encounters with professorial champions,especially Jerry, an Irish terrier who would fight with his own shadowrather than not fight at all, but one morning our chapel vestibule wasthe scene of an encounter that Isaac Watts might well have calledhorrendous.The aggressor was Coco, a fierce little Boston bull and the pride ofone of the town's most honored citizens. Coco fought by method and avery effective method it was. He would sneak up to his chosenantagonist, fly at the forehead, tear the flesh so that the streamingblood blinded his enemy and then try for a grip on the throat. Half thedogs in the village already bore Coco's mark when, one March morning,Joy-of-Life and I went in to chapel, leaving Sigurd, as usual, to waitfor us outside. As a dog, whom we did not pause to identify, wastrotting down the avenue, we laid strict injunctions on Sigurd not toget into a scrap.The organ was calling all hearts to worship, and heads were alreadybowed, when suddenly Sigurd, his earnest eyes trying in vain to explainhis difficulties, pressed in against our knees. This was a grave breachof chapel decorum, and Joy-of-Life, rising instantly, led him down theaisle. As she opened the door into the vestibule, Coco was upon him,and the snarling fury of a dog-fight jarred against the solemn strainsof the organ. I slipped out to find Coco hanging from Sigurd's throat,and Sigurd, blood streaming from his forehead over his face, sohampered by a ring of hands pulling on his collar that he could onlysnap his jaws in air, unable to see or reach his foe. The choir,arrayed for the processional, had broken line and were banging Cocowith hymn books, while everybody was wildly issuing orders to everybodyelse."Let the dogs alone, girls. Look out for yourselves.""Let Sigurd go. Give him a chance to fight.""Choke Coco off.""Twist Coco's tail.""Bring water.""_Don't_ put your hands between them, girls. Keep away."The janitor, the only man on the scene, had discreetly climbed into ahigh window-seat, and it was one of the slenderest, most flowerlikemaidens there who finally jerked a half-strangled Coco loose and flunghim forth from the sacred portals. The choir promptly reformed in rankand, a trifle flushed and disheveled but chanting more lustily thanever, swung up the aisle with the air of the Church Militant. Only thefew who were slightly bitten remained behind to be conducted byJoy-of-Life to the hospital for immediate attention to their wounds,while Sigurd and I made for home, marking the trail with our blood. Noreal harm was done. Coco's owner, though secretly convinced that Sigurddid all the biting, insisted on paying the doctor's bills and, a fewdays after the encounter, Sigurd, with a scarred forehead, welcomed hisinjured defenders to a dinner-party, at which I presided with my arm ina sling. Sigurd seemed to feel a dim responsibility for that hurt ofmine and, as long as I wore a bandage, would come up at intervals togive it a penitent lick.At all the festivals of the spring term Sigurd deemed his attendanceindispensable. He fell in with the parades, frisked out into the midstof the campus dances, and once, at least, took a conspicuous part inthe Tree Day pageant. A graceful, carmine-clad Narcissus had died toslow music on the bank of Longfellow Fountain. The wood-nymphs andwater-nymphs, Diana and her train, even the hilltop Oreads had trippedoff the sylvan stage, but the audience, massed on the other side of thepool, refused to take the hint and, instead of breaking up, still satspell-bound, their gaze fastened on poor Narcissus, who, cramped in thedying attitude, could not conceive any dramatic way of coming to lifeagain. So we bade Sigurd: "Go find," and after two false starts, oncefor a squirrel and once for a stick, he sped straight for Narcissusand, anxiously thrusting his nose into her face, recognized a specialfriend and broke into loud barks of joy, while, throwing her arm abouthim, she sprang no less gladly to her feet. The audience thought it alla part of the pageant, the prevailing opinion being that Sigurd wasplaying the r?le of Cerberus and welcoming Narcissus to Hades.But for all his years of enthusiastic college attendance, Sigurd nevertook a degree. Not even his own Class of 1911 was allowed to carry outits design of dressing their mascot in a specially made cap and gownand leading him with them in the Commencement procession. His B.A.stood only for Beloved Animal.TO SIGURD    Not one blithe leap of welcome? Can you lie    Under this woodland mold,    More still    Than broken daffodil,    When I,    Home from too long a roving,    Come up the silent hill?    Dear, wistful eyes,    White ruff and windy gold    Of collie coat so oft caressed,    Not one quick thrill    In snowy breast,    One spring of jubilant surprise,    One ecstasy of loving?    Are all our frolics ended? Never more    Those royal romps of old,    When one,    Playfellow of the sun,    Would pour    Adventures and romances    Into a morning run;    Off and away,    A flying glint of gold,    Startling to wing a husky choir    Of crows whose dun    Shadows would tire    Even that wild speed? Unscared to-day    They hold their weird seances.    Ever you dreamed, legs twitching, you would catch    A crow, O leaper bold,    Next time,    Or chase to branch sublime    That batch    Of squirrels daring capture    In saucy pantomime;    Till one spring dawn,    Resting amid the gold    Of crocuses, Death stole on you    From that far clime    Where dreams come true,    And left upon the starry lawn    Your form without your rapture.    And was Death's whistle then so wondrous sweet    Across the glimmering wold    That you    Would trustfully pursue    Strange feet?    When I was gone, each morrow    You sought our old haunts through,    Slower to play,    Drooping in faded gold.    Now it is mine to grieve and miss    My comrade true,    Who used to kiss    With eager tongue such tears away,    Coaxing a smile from sorrow.    I know not what life is, nor what is death,    Nor how vast Heaven may hold    All this    Earth-beauty and earth-bliss.    Christ saith    That not a sparrow falleth    --O songs of sparrow faith!--    But God is there.    May not a leap of gold    Yet greet me on some gladder hill,    A shining wraith,    Rejoicing still,    As in those hours we found so fair,    To follow where love calleth?FAREWELLS    "The door of Death is made of gold,    That mortal eyes cannot behold."    --Blake's _Dedication to Queen Charlotte_.We were slow to realize that Sigurd was having too many birthdays. Thatguardian figure stretched out on the south porch just above the steps,shining like an embodied welcome, had become a part of life itself.Indeed, a caller, not famed for tact, after surveying our Volsung forsome time in silence, dropped the cryptic remark: "How much a dog comesto look like the family!" Brightening our busy months with goldenglints of romp and mischief and caress, he kept his run of birthdayslike festivals which brought no warning with them.They were celebrated with becoming pomp, with much-wrapped gifts thathe rejoiced to open himself and often with a yellow tea. As his tasteinclined to broad and simple effects, there would be a giant sunflowerin the center of the table, with strips of goldenrod emanating from itlike rays. The guests, his best-beloved of all ages and conditions,would drink Sigurd's health in orangeade and feast in his honor onsponge cake. From the day of Poor Ellen to that of HousewifeHoneyvoice, Amelia, a young and comely Irish Protestant, reigned in thekitchen and made it her pride to celebrate Sigurd's anniversaries withall due splendor, though even then she would not intermit the dailyscoldings to which she attributed his very gradual growth in grace. Forstill he would run away at intervals and wallow in all iniquity. If theprodigal returned by daylight and found us together, he would disporthimself at our feet in a brief agony of penitence. As he lay on hisback, writhing with remorse and apparently trying to clasp his paws insupplication, we would reproach him, to the accompaniment of his hollowgroans, until our gravity would break down. Then he would cheerfullyscramble up and fetch us his latest rubber toy, with a coaxinginvitation to let bygones be bygones and have a frisk with Sigurd. Ifhe came home under cover of darkness, he would shamelessly go straightto his own piazza corner, venting an indignant grunt, like an outragedman of the house, if he found his supper soggy and his bed not made.The birthday teas, though they brought so many of his friends acrossthe threshold, were not an unmixed joy to Sigurd. The flaunting bow ofnew, stiff, yellow ribbon tickled his ears, until he had succeeded inworking it around, a rumpled knot, under his chin, and worse yet werethe wreaths of yellow wild flowers that the small fingers of some ofhis child neighbors had woven for his neck. His share of his ownbirthday cake, too, was more hygienically apportioned than he approved.What is a speck of yellow frosting on a collie's long red tongue? ButAmelia saw to it that his birthday dinner was after his ownheart,--fresh corncake, rice and liver, while now and then some devotedsophomore, even though the long vacation had put a thousand milesbetween them, would send him a home-made chocolate cream as large as asaucer, at which he was allowed only to sniff and nibble.We may have noticed that Sigurd's girth was ampler and his bearing moresedate than in his younger days, but still he was the first in everyfrolic and almost as fleet as a deer. He roused one at the edge of thewoods one morning when he was out for an early airing with Joy-of-Lifeand chased it across the meadows so fast and far that she was in dismaylest he overtake the beautiful creature and pull it down. Even to thelast he would let no dog pass him. His frankest admirer andfellow-runner through his sunset years was a simple-minded young colliewhom Sigurd would outwit by wheeling sharply, when he felt Sandygaining on him, and making off at right angles while the precipitatepursuer sped on for some distance in the old direction. But the goalwas what Sigurd chose to make it, and Sandy, bewildered by these subtletactics, always believed himself outrun.We had come to regard a walk without Sigurd as hardly a walk at all.Perhaps we observed that he found the heat, which brought out histormenting eczema, a little harder to bear from summer to summer, butour crisp, crackling winters revived him to all manner of puppy antics.I remember, like a picture, one frosty afternoon, the evergreensfestooned with ice, while the leafless trees, struck by the level raysof the western sun, glistened with rainbow crystals. Through thisenchanted world, as through the heart of a diamond, Joy-of-Life andSigurd were coming home. Sigurd, barking his glad music, was boundinghither and thither over the sparkling crust, now trying to fulfill hiscontract to keep all chickadees and nut-hatches, blue jays and juncos,from alighting on the earth, and now convinced that at last the momenthad come when he was to realize his supreme ambition, inherited fromRalph, and catch a crow. Their sardonic caws above his head, as theyflapped heavily from pine to pine, made him so furious that he wouldpounce on their black, sliding shadows, while Joy-of-Life, her cheeksapple-bright with the cold, laughed at him so merrily that he took itfor applause.Yet change was busy about our collie, who welcomed no changes but lovedhis world exactly as it was. We sold the first home and moved into amore spacious one that we had built on a strip of untamed land hard by.Then a street came, and more houses, and quietly the wildwood drew awayfrom us. Within our own bounds, at least, we strove to keep the forestgrowth in its own careless beauty, but never a man stepped on theplace, brother or guest or gardener or state warden or whosoever, but,driven by the deep instinct of the pioneer, he must needs go stealthilyforth with ax or saw or shears and lay about him in our happy tangle.The worst of it was that we had to appear grateful.Sigurd accepted his new abode with but a passing bewilderment. Racingup from the train on his return from a summer in the mountains withJoy-of-Life, he was whistled into the Scarab while yet too utterlyabsorbed in the rapture of his greetings to heed where he was. After alittle he looked about him in obvious surprise and perplexity and setout at once on a tour of investigation, trotting from cellar to attic,nosing into the closets and under the shelves, sniffing at the familiardesks and bookcases and recognizing with a wag his own chair and rug.As soon as might be he was out of doors, examining porches and paths.Then he crossed the intervening bit of wilderness, granite ledge mattedover with the red-berried kinnikinic, and woofed for admittance at hisaccustomed door. He was kindly received and allowed to go about as heliked, upstairs and downstairs and into my lord's chamber, but thefurniture was not his furniture, the smells were not his smells, andwithin ten minutes he had quitted those rooms, scene of so many puppyexploits, to enter them no more. He knew the difference between houseand home.Yet our new holding did not seem to Sigurd nor to us entirely naturaluntil he had cut one of his unfortunate paws on a broken bottle left bythe carpenters as a souvenir and had strewn steps and driveway and lawnwith shreds of cotton bandages and adhesive plaster. "When is a clutternot a clutter?" asked my mother, and answered her own conundrum: "WhenSigurd does it."In a snug corner against the south wall of the Scarab stood a massiveand elegant erection, with gable roof and olive-green door, that onlythe unsophisticated called a kennel. It was "Sigurd's House," and assuch he accepted it, counting its artistically shingled walls and heavylayers of sheathing paper no more than his just deserts. He delightedin its deep bed of fresh straw which tickled him most agreeably as herolled over and over in it. He found it an exciting by-play, too, todash in with stick or bone and lose it under his bedding, which hewould proceed to scratch up with all the fury of a New England matronin housecleaning time. Then he would come swaggering out with the airof duty done, shaking his own skin. Sigurd's House was such a palacethat the children of the neighborhood liked to play in it, but ourcollie deemed this high trespass and, from the screened study porch,would roar indignant protest when five or six chubby tots, with thatsaucy black spaniel, Curly, would all squeeze in together.To the Scarab came new friends for Sigurd with new caresses, to whichhe always made cordial and courteous response. Amelia crossed the oceanto a waiting bridegroom and a happy home of her own, but HousewifeHoney-voice, with her little Esther, petted Sigurd even more devotedly.Sigurd's only difficulty with Housewife Honey-voice, the only shadow ontheir sympathy, arose from the delicacy of her appetite by which shewas inclined, at first, to measure his. When her enthusiasm andculinary skill persuaded the family to go on a vegetable diet, Sigurdgave us clearly to understand that we need not count him in. And when Icame home, one evening, from a week's motor trip, Sigurd barely waitedfor his customary chant of welcome before gripping my dress and leadingme to the refrigerator."Hasn't Sigurd had his dinner yet?""Why, yes, an hour ago.""Nonsense, boy! You're not hungry. Nobody is hungry just after dinner.""What a whopper!" sighed Sigurd, as he pattered after me back to thestudy.No sooner had I turned my attention to the accumulation of letters onmy desk than again Sigurd pulled gently, yet with determination, at myskirt and insisted on a second promenade to the refrigerator."He really is hungry. How much have you been giving him for dinner?"But when I saw the measure, I heaped his plate, while he eagerlywatched the process, waving his tail in triumph, but hurrying onceacross the kitchen to snuggle his head against the knee of HousewifeHoney-voice, looking up at her with those comprehending, trustful eyesthat said:"You didn't _mean_ to starve dear Sigurd, and now that you know how bigmy hollow is, it will be all right forever."Every autumn a new horde of freshmen fell in love with him and visitingalumn? embraced him in mid-campus. Toward the Freshman Twins, whogladdened the Scarab one year, he conducted himself like a sophomore,humoring their childish ways, guiding them through the collegelabyrinth, serving as a towel for their homesick tears and partakingfreely of their consoling fudge, but all with a comical air ofcondescension. He was himself accustomed to the best society, evenseniors. Our gracious college president made him welcome to herveranda, as she sat at tea among her roses; a beloved frequenter of theScarab, Hoops-of-Steel, though clinging to her preference for boys,accorded him a true if tempered friendship; and even Scholar Carol, ourfifteenth-century historian, who affected the fireside sphinx and hadnamed a particularly gallant kitten Eddy IV, counted him only a littlelower than a cat. As for the children on our hill, they hugged him tothe limit of endurance. His warmest admirer among them was Wee-wee, arosy bunch of unweariable energy, who, when she came to us of anafternoon in order to give her exhausted parents a brief respite, wouldwear out the entire family as, one by one, we undertook to amuse her,and would finally fling herself upon Sigurd, riding on his back,rolling him over and over and examining his paws with an enviousadmiration that broke forth in the remark: "Wen I'm old and big likeSigurd, maybe I'll have feet on _my_ hands."For two lively years a brace of graduate students, Cherub and Seraph,folded their wings beneath the Scarab rooftree. Cherub was a bitafraid, at first, of "that bouncing yellow elephant," but Seraphinstantly became Sigurd's very pink of playmates. Every morning theywould start off early for the college library, scampering across thelandscape at a rate that sent the sparrows fluttering from their pathlike so many irregular verbs. Between the meadow and the campus is aperilous stretch of railway tracks and trolley tracks, and here Sigurdwould assume full charge of his companion. If the whistle of an engine,as they drew near the crossing, cut the air, Sigurd would leap upon herand, with his paws upon her breast, hold her back until the train hadhurtled by, when he would lead her triumphantly across under thetrailing plume of smoke. Every autumnal Sunday they spent hourstogether in the woods, from which the Seraph would bring home gentians,wych-hazel and a lyric, and Sigurd a ruff all tangled up with burrs.Winter did not daunt their zeal. They formed themselves into a rescueexpedition and saved from the frost all manner of wild-flower roots,which the Seraph arranged in rows of pots placed on boards stretchedfrom a little table in her room to her south window. Alas for sweetSaint Charity! There came a day when Sigurd, wishing to study thescenery to verify a suspicion of a dog burglar after his treasure-troveof bones, sprang up and struck his forefeet on the edge of the nearestboard with such violence that the whole structure came crashing down,enveloping him in a flying ruin of pots and plants and earth and water.He did not stay to help the Seraph clear up the landslide, butremembered a pressing engagement in the remotest corner of the attic.Through December these happy comrades explored the fringes of theforest for glowing vines to serve as Christmas decorations, and in thewhirling snowstorms of a peculiarly ferocious little February theywould come romping home, two white objects plunging through the drifts,looking like Peary and one of his huskies just back from the NorthPole. Joy-of-Life had been in Egypt that winter, seeking health after agrave illness, but she came again with April, more welcome than thespring. Sigurd bounded to her shoulders in ecstasy of greeting, hiscoat ruddy in the sun. He shone more than ever with a supreme contentas he sat erect between us while we motored through the miracle of May,under red-budded maples and oaks whose baby leaves, while the oriolesshouted to them to hurry up, where trembling from misty pink to goldengreen. He did not care to run with the machine, however slowly it wasdriven, but saved his energies for the long rambles with the Seraph, asshe went questing for anemone and dogwood, bellwort, violets,columbine, lady slippers and all          "our shining little sisters    Of the forest and the fields."As the days grew warmer, he would forget the admonitions of previoussprings and all his good resolutions, and take a roll, now and then, toSister Jane's wrath and anguish, in a bed of jonquils or yellow tulips,claiming that their color made them his by royal right. When we scoldedhim, he took refuge with the Seraph, though even she was causing himbitter annoyance, as June and Commencement drew near, by her attentionsto a fuzzy puppy, Puck, whom she visited almost daily at collie kennelstwo miles away. He was a prize puppy and it disgusted Sigurd beyondbarks to see the fuss we all made over certain dog-show awards thatPuck gave the Seraph to bring home, a green ribbon not worth thechewing and an _empty_ cut-glass vase. When Puck, on the eve ofSeraph's departure, was himself brought to the Scarab and a journeyingbasket was equipped for him, Sigurd sulked in the shabby depths of hisdear old chair. All the small folk of our neighborhood flocked in topat Puppy Ki-yi, as Joy-of-Life and I privily dubbed our guest, butonly Wee-wee, whose own name for the mite was "Minister--Ittle TeenyMinister, coz he stan's on his back legs an' jiggles his arms an'pweaches at us," divined Sigurd's jealous misery. She snuggled down inthe chair beside him, hugging the yellow ball into which he had rolledhimself and solicitously explaining that "Minister is the best 'ittledog, and Sigurd is the best gweat _big_ dog," but the Volsung did notcare for a divided homage and shook his ears at all puppy worshipers.Then the Seraph disappeared, as all his student lovers, one afteranother, would disappear. Letters came back to him and gifts, but hecould not puzzle out what these had to do with the dancing playmate nolonger to be found on hillside or by lake. Nor could he foresee the daywhen that ridiculous Puck, grown into a noble collie, would in his turnsorely miss the Seraph, who had sailed away, on the ship that boreanother of Sigurd's most devoted Wellesley lassies, to France. Therewere dogs on that ship, Professor Peggy and her scarred comrades,veterans of war, that had been sent over, like wounded French officers,to instruct, and were now returning to duty at the front. But Puck, tooold for the Red Cross training, was left behind, sniffing up and downthe garden paths in patient search for his dainty mistress, who,arrayed in gas-mask and trench-helmet, was serving from a batteredcamionette hot coffee and cocoa to our boys in khaki just behind thetrenches.In the Orchard, too, the venerable Cousin for whom Sigurd sincepuppyhood had cherished a romantic attachment, the white-hairedinamorata whom he would run to meet with his most grotesque waggle, wasno longer to be found in the familiar nooks from which Laddie had longsince disappeared. And now that the all-beloved Elder Sister laymortally ill, Sigurd pattered over day after day to look in at thesickroom and invite a stroking from the delicate hand that would restso languidly upon his lifted head. Sometimes he carried her a yellowchrysanthemum or a cluster of cream-colored tea-roses tied to hiscollar. And when she had passed to Paradise through brain-wanderingmemories of Italy, as through a vestibule of beauty, Sigurd coaxed longat the closed door, whining softly, calling to his friend, troubled bythe silence but incredulous of death.Because of their vanishing ways, Sigurd had early come to look oncollege girls in general as an inconstant factor in life and acceptedtheir attentions with the casual air of a confirmed old bachelor, buthis faithfulness to his friends of riper age never wavered. Even to thelast he always raised for the Lady of Cedar Hill his rapturous lyriccry, though it would sometimes embarrass him by breaking into a hoarseand husky squeak. He had special ways with each of us. He kept onepiquant game for my mother, who, while he wagged his tail in everwilder circles at her, would wag her _Congregationalist_ in exactmockery at him, until he would make a maddened leap and snatch thatsacred sheet from her hand.But he was gentle with old people, even in his frolics, and from thefirst had felt a certain responsibility for their safety. Joy-of-Lifehad left him late one afternoon, while he was still a youngster, toguard her mother's nap on the piazza couch, but a white flash ofLaddie, temptation incarnate, at the foot of the hill, had sent himcareering off into the gloaming. Rising hurriedly to call him back,confused by the sudden waking, his charge had missed her footing in thedusk and fallen down the steps. Her first clear consciousness was ofSigurd standing over her, licking her face and hands with a penitenttongue, nor would he leave her all that evening, lying on the edge ofher dress as she sat and trotting close beside her whenever she crossedthe room. And when, touched by his concern, she bent to him and said:"I wasn't really hurt, and Sigurd was a good dog to come back," hejoyously flopped over on his spine and presented his snowy shirt-frontfor a forgiving pat.A household dear to Sigurd was that in which two of our collegeprofessors, long retired, dwelt in sisterly affection. He bore himselfwith the utmost discretion there, as if aware of a dignity andfragility beyond the wont of households. The classicist, whose Greekprecision of accent gave beauty to her least remark, would introduceSigurd to callers from abroad as "one of our most distinguishedcitizens," while the botanist, prisoned in a hooded chair onwheels,--ah, the feet that had so often and so lightly carried her in aday over twenty miles and more of the green earth she loved!--liked tohave him escort her on her pathetic airings. He was not with her, butattending his own family on a drive one day, when we saw in the villagesquare before us a sudden commotion, people running from all sidestoward that familiar little carriage, which, rashly left standing atthe edge of the curb with its hood open toward the wind, had beenoverset, so that the poor lady, strapped to the seat, was standing onher bonnet. Sigurd reached her first of all and when, shocked by thejar into a momentary oblivion, she looked up, "it was," she afterwardsaid, "right into the kindest, most reassuring brown eyes in theworld," for Sigurd's head was drooping close above her own and all thehelp that a collie could give beamed in his friendly gaze.Hints of age began to appear, reluctant though we were to recognizethem, in Sigurd himself,--an inclination toward longer and longer napsin his own disreputable chair, an increasing resentment of sweepingdays and housecleaning, and a tendency, long after a swollen ear or asharp attack of eczema was cured and Sigurd, settling his chin on hispaws, had dismissed Dr. Vet with a low, majestic sweep of tail, tocontinue to claim the lazy privileges of an invalid. Sometimes hisstiffening limbs failed to fold themselves with the old comfort intothe hollow of his chair, and he would look up to us in puzzled appeal.He was a handsome collie still, but his manners had grown more reservedand his bearing more stately. He was no longer excited by Commencementfestivities, though he would stroll up to take a look at the Tree Daydances and saunter into the Garden Party, accepting the embraces of oldfriends and new with an amiability only slightly tinged with boredom.But he loved more and more to bask in the sun on the south porch or todream, his legs tied into his favorite bowknot, in front of the studyfireplace, where Joy-of-Life's annual barrel of Christmas driftwoodmade the flames look like little rainbows on a holiday.He was almost ten years old when he was run over by an automobile.Except for a bruised paw he did not seem to be hurt, for he crouched soflat in the road that the machine merely scraped his back, but hisnerves were severely shaken. When we came home that noon, he greeted uswith a prolonged, strange howl, unlike anything that we had ever heardfrom him before, and for weeks would not venture out upon the roadswithout one of us to serve as bodyguard, wheedling until we had to dropour books and devise some respectable excuse for a walk. Left behind ata Greek Letter Society House one evening, he refused to start off forhome alone--the bold ranger of a thousand midnights--and his indulgentgirl hostesses telephoned for a carriage, so that Sigurd came proudlydriving up to his front door in a hack. He so enjoyed the extra pettingthat came with any mischance that he affected, when it occurred to him,this terror long after it had faded out, just as he would in runningtuck up an injured foot, when he happened to think of it, weeks afterit was healed, and hop plaintively on three legs until the sight of acat or a squirrel made him forget all about it.Sigurd had several promising sons in the village, and one of these wewould gladly have adopted had not our delight in its puppy gracesnearly broken his jealous old heart. So we let it go to other admirersand presently lost all trace of his golden scions. But one day, when Iwas walking with him, a winsome little lad came up and, touching hiscap, asked shyly if he might stroke Sigurd, "for he's the papa of mydog Trusty that died." Poor Trusty was a victim of distemper, and thechild softly told us all about it, his arms about the neck of Sigurd,who put on an appropriate expression of bereavement.The burden of the years brought its own compensation. Instead of thedarkling escapades that used to distract and worry us, Sigurd becamethe best of company, in the depths of a winter night. Joy-of-Life wasthe lark of the household, and I the owl, so our self-appointedcaretaker, after seeing her early to bed, would come downstairs againto lie close against my feet, inviting confidences. When I became tooabsorbed in my task to answer his remarks, he would still hold forth ina broken conversational grumble, contented, for reply, with thecrackling of the fire and the scratching of a pen.Nor was Sigurd the only one of our blithe fellowship for whom Time wasquietly setting up milestones along the changing road. He was still inhis prime when, on a date of gleaming memory, the Dryad gave atNorumbega Hall a birthday party for my mother, a party musical with ourPoet's own sweet and roguish songs, not only in honor of            "her who graciously    With each soft year younger grows,    As the earth with every rose,"but in merry greeting of each of the other guests. The white-crownedmother of Joy-of-Life was there, and the mother of the CollegeReconciler,    "Who, over and over      (The Lady from Dover),    Turns thistles to clover."The spirited hostess of Norumbega, a bright-eyed little grandmotherimmensely proud of that distinction, sat opposite the presiding Dryad,and beside my mother was her Mount Holyoke classmate of the heroic daysof Mary Lyon, our gentle Librarian Emeritus, so modest from her longmaidenhood that she was distressed at the infant art of aviation,fearing that one could no longer brush one's hair in a dressing-sacquefree from the peril of a man swooping down from the clouds to peep inat the window.It is but a few years since that hour of    "Laurels and laughter and light,"yet all those smiling elder faces, and not those only, have vanishedaway.Sigurd had his part in that fairest of our festivities, for animpressionistic picture of him shines from the stanza that the Dryadaddressed to Joy-of-Life:    "This lady is always attended      By a golden and comet-y trail    Of light, speed, sound, fury all blended.    This lady is always attended    By a beautiful vision and splendid,      A flaunting and triumphing tail.    This lady is always attended      By a golden and comet-y trail."A saucier dinner-card was mine:    "You see her start out all agog    For chapel, pursued by her dog.      You may think her a saint,      But he thinks she ain't,    When she sets him to guarding a frog."A dagger affixed to this effusion called attention to a learned note:    "This is a scientific error: the beast should be _Bufo Lentiginosus_    not _Rana catesbiana_. Such errors are common in the best poetry."As successive sorrows cast their shadows on our hearts, as the mothersslipped away, as the Dryad was smitten down in her brightness, a starfallen from midsummer sky, Sigurd proved himself a very comforter. Thesympathetic droop of his ears and decorum of his disconsolate browneyes in the first hush of mourning and, in the later loneliness, hisnuzzling head against the knee, touches of a pleading tongue on handand cheek, his insistence on an answering smile, a pat, a romp, hisconviction that, while sun and wind made holiday and the wood was fullof sticks to throw for Sigurd, it was natural to be glad, helped usbetter than more formal consolations. Both solitude and society, bothignorance and wisdom, he could press close to the hurt withoutintrusion. Often when one or the other of us, forgetful of the workupon the desk, had let the cloud creep over, Sigurd would rousehimself, trot across to the fireplace, select from the basket a pieceof light kindling wood, and present it with the clear intimation thatit would be more true to love to cheer up Sigurd with a bit of playthan to lose the hour in grieving.Rarely in his joyful life, and then but for a matter of days or weeks,had we both been away from Sigurd. He hated to have either of us go. Heknew only too well the meaning of trunks and suitcases and alwaysstalked uneasily about the room, getting in the way as much aspossible, during the process of packing. When at last he saw theseobjects of ill omen closed and carried downstairs, followed by one ofhis mistresses in traveling garb, he would desperately take his standin the doorway and, planting his legs like principles, do his best tobar her exit. For a few days he would be very restless, watchful,anxious, keeping close to the mistress who stayed behind to questionher with troubled looks and entreat her not to abandon Sigurd; nor wasthe missing all on his side. The summer of 1908 was so hot that ourgasping collie would tease his friends to fan him and, for the firstand only time, we had him shaved. His bright hair, duly cleansed, wasmade up with corn-colored silk into a sofa-pillow and sent toJoy-of-Life, then sojourning in strange places, now among the Mormons,now on an Indian reservation, gathering material for her two vividvolumes on the _Economic Beginnings of the Far West_; and she assuredhim that his "yellow bunch of love" was a magical cure for a certainache beyond the ken of the doctors. But grievously abashed he was withonly the white waves of his ruff, his fore-pantalets and plumy tailunprofaned by the shears, and his sufferings from mortification andmosquitoes outwent all that he had endured from the heat. As his silkyunder-vest grew long enough to curl, he reminded us of Cagnotte, thesupposed poodle bought for three-year-old Gautier by his nurse, on whomthe Paris dealers palmed off a cur sewed up in a jacket of lamb's wool.On summer vacations our Volsung sometimes went up into New Hampshirewith one or both of us. He especially rejoiced in our cottage life onTwin Lake, where Sigurd renewed his youth, pursuing                "the swallows o'er the meads    With scarce a slower flight."Here he learned to scratch up his own bed in the pine needles and towash his stick at the edge of the lake after a game, though we neverquite succeeded, on account of his masculine prejudices, in teachinghim to wash his dinner-plate. There were drawbacks, however, aboutthese summer travels with Sigurd. His first concern, on arriving at anew place, was to go the rounds of the neighborhood and knock over allthe dogs. Having thus established our popularity, he proceeded to makehimself at home, welcoming most affably the dog-owners who called tocomplain of his exploits.One summer he was with Joy-of-Life up in Franconia, where they loved toclimb the scenery, Sigurd taking immense satisfaction in his duties asguide. "Find the path, boy," she would bid, and very proudly he wouldrun at a little distance before her, nosing out the way. It was on oneof these excursions that he came upon a scattered flock of sheepand--hey presto!--was instantly transformed into a dog that we hadnever known. Uttering a curious "Yep, yep, yep!" unlike any sound hehad ever been heard to make before, he sped away toward thoseastonished sheep, rounded them up and drove them, much too fast fortheir comfort, to the furthest limit of their sloping pasture, whereJoy-of-Life found him, panting in tremendous excitement, holding thesheep, a woolly huddle, penned into an angle of the deep stone walls.The next morning he was off before daybreak and, after an arduoussearch, she found him again playing stern guardian to that sameembarrassed flock. If only the Lady of Cedar Hill had offered him thelordship of a sheepfold instead of a cattle-barn, Sigurd would havebeen Njal to the end of his days. But Joy-of-Life, afraid that theancestral Scotch conscience so suddenly awakened in him might not be tothe liking of the Franconia farmers, decided on an immediate return tothe Scarab.Sigurd always detested train travel, and this time he barely escaped atragedy. The baggage car was so full that to him could be allotted onlya space the size of his body. Into that narrow cavity he was confinedby walls of trunks that towered on every side. Within an hour of Bostonan abrupt jolt threw the passengers forward in their seats. Beyond afew bumps and bruises no harm was done and Joy-of-Life speedily madeher way forward through the disordered train, which had come to astandstill, to the baggage-car. Here she found a scene of disastrousconfusion, trunks and valises pitched madly about, one baggagemangroaning with a broken arm, on which a doctor was already busy, and theother bleeding from a cut across his forehead. For very shame she couldnot speak of a collie until, under the doctor's directions, she hadwashed and bound up that cut. It was her patient who mentioned Sigurdfirst."By George, your dog!" he said. "He's down under that tumble of trunksover there. Not a yelp from him. I'm afraid he hadn't a chance."Brakemen had pushed in, by this time, and with ready sympathy undertookto clear a way to the corner where Sigurd had been imprisoned. Amonster crate had fallen in such a way as to roof him over and, whenthis was dragged aside, there crouched Sigurd, showing no physicalinjury but utterly motionless, staring with blank eyes at his rescuers."Back broken," suggested one of the men.But Joy-of-Life gave, though from pale lips, the glad, out-of-doortrill that Sigurd knew so well. He quivered and, with one tremendousbound, cleared the intervening heap of baggage and reached her. She saton a portmanteau, with her arms about him, till they arrived at Boston,and then led him down the platform and took him with her into a cab.All the time Sigurd was strange, remote, moving like a body without aspirit, unresponsive to all her attempts at comfort and cheer. Butduring the long wait for her missing trunk, Sigurd suddenly brightenedup and tried to scrabble out of the window into the cab drawn upalongside. It was occupied by a plump, elderly couple, who gleefullypulled him in, and to them Sigurd at once began to tell, in eagerwhines and pitiful whimpers, that hardly needed Joy-of-Life'scommentary, the story of his peril."Poor fellow! Poor beauty!" they crooned. "We know, we know. Our owndear collie was killed in just such a mix-up twenty years ago. Yourcollie knew that we would understand."And Sigurd, restored in soul at last, licked their kind old faces andretired to his own cab. By the time he reached home, he was socompletely himself again that he ate a hearty dinner and spent thebetter part of the evening scratching up the straw in Sigurd's House tosee what treasures dogs and children might have stored there during hisabsence.In the scorching July of 1913 we both left Sigurd for a year. The poorlad was so wretched with the heat that we hoped he might be less keenlyaware than usual of the packing; but he knew. I do not like to rememberthe look in his eyes when, that last morning, he was brought up fromhis retreat in the cellar for good-by. I turn from that memory to hisantics a few evenings earlier, when he had been out frisking with somedog callers in the comparative cool. He woofed imperiously at thescreen door and, as soon as it was unlatched, dashed it open and cametearing into the study to demand of me some service that I was slow tocomprehend."How dull you are to-night!" he grunted and, flouncing down beside me,fell clumsily to work on a hind paw. Investigating, I found a longthorn run up into the pad. It took me a minute or two to grip it andpull it out, while Sigurd, wincing a little but with full confidence inmy surgery, waited as patiently as a boy when a ball game is on. Whenthe thorn was drawn, he gave one flying lick to his foot and another tomy hand--"Much obliged, but you might have been quicker about it"--andbounded back to his play with puppy eagerness.We had made all possible arrangements for his comfort, boarding himstill at his home where three of the household remained with the newtenants, but he was no longer the Lord of the Scarab. We knew that hewould do his golden best and we hoped that in his own sweet wisdom hewould realize that love never goes away, but as he watched and searchedin vain, week after week and month after month, Sigurd drooped, andgrew deaf with listening for voices over sea. Old friends took him onthe short walks that sufficed him now and affectionate greetings methim everywhere on campus and on street. He would often be seen nappingon one neighborly porch or another, for he dwelt more and more in thedim land of "Nod, the shepherd," consorting with    "His blind old sheep-dog, Slumber-soon."Housewife Honey-voice gave him true and tender care, and when, on azero night, she had to deny him the warmth of the Scarab and put him tobed, well tucked up with rugs, in Sigurd's House, she would tell him,for the strengthening of his spirit, that "even Jesus Christ slept inthe straw."For our own part, we tried not to think too much of our forsakencollie, but up in Norway we heard dogs called by his name and even onour housetop promenades in Seville we were reminded of his frolic graceby a scalawag puppy on a neighboring flat roof, a gleeful littlegymnast whose joy it was to leap up and jerk the linen off the line.Sigurd's friends and ours wrote to us of his welfare with acheerfulness that was apt to waver before the end of the paragraph."I met him on the campus yesterday," scribbled Nannikachee, "and when Iasked him where his professors were, he galloped all over the snow,remembering you as juncos, and on second thought he reared up againstan oak and barked up into its branches to scare you out of your holes,convinced that you had come to a bad end and been turned intosquirrels. Such are the workings of the mighty mind you two silliescredit him with! He looked as round and yellow as a Thanksgivingpumpkin, but there was something wistful about him, too."On the twenty-third of May, within a month of our return, Sigurd died.To all his losses had been added, that spring, the loss of CollegeHall, through whose familiar corridors he had roamed as usual, alwaysseeking, one March afternoon, and which he found the next morning adesolation of blackened walls and blowing ashes. If Sigurd could havecounted into the hundreds, he would have known that every girl wassafe, but if he could have read in the papers of the quiet self-controlwith which, roused from their sleep to find the flames crackling aboutthem, they had steadily carried through their fire-drill, formed theirlines, waited for the word and gone out in perfect order, he would havebeen no prouder of them than he always was. Of course his Wellesleygirls would behave like that.Sigurd crowded with the rest of the college into close quarters, wherehe was more than ever underfoot. On that languid twenty-second of Mayhe slept all day along the threshold of the improvised postoffice, andthe hurrying feet stepped over him with unreproaching care. But withthe arrival of the late afternoon mail, the postmistress, knowing therush that was to come, said kindly to him:"Now, Sigurd, you must really go away."He rose slowly and moved from door to door till he came to the officeof the Christian Association. Assured of Samaritan shelter here, hefinished his snooze on their one rescued rug, but arrived at home inpunctual time for his dinner, and that night it chanced to be thedinner Sigurd liked best. Little Esther, who had a romp with him on hisarrival, said he "smiled all over when he smelt the liver cooking."He scraped out his pan to the last crumb and then lay down in afavorite burrow of loose, cool earth for a twilight revery. One of thehousehold, a new lover, invited him to take a stroll with her, but heexcused himself with a grateful rub of his head against her knees.He slept in Sigurd's House, as usual, and started out soon after dawn,as usual, to go for a splash in a brook not far away. An early riser,intent on making up her count of birds, met him and reported that hewas trotting briskly and saluted her with "a sunny twinkle of histail." Across the road from the brook is a pleasant old homestead underwhose great trees Sigurd often took a morning nap before returning tothe Scarab. Its occupants looked from the window, as they weredressing, and saw him lying at ease under a spreading evergreen. Anhour later, as they rose from breakfast, they observed that Sigurd hadnot changed his posture and, going out to bid him good morning, foundhim lifeless. There was no injury on his body nor any sign of pain orstruggle. He had made friends even with Death.Did he, like the old hero Njal, "gentle and generous," foreknow his endas he chose out this quiet, beautiful spot? "We will go to our bed,"said Njal in the saga, "and lay us down. I have long been eager forrest."A grave was dug for Sigurd on the brow of Observatory Hill over whichhe had so often sped in the splendor of his strength, and there, underthe pines, some score of his closest friends and ours gathered thefollowing morning. With the reading of dog poems and the dropping ofwild flowers they gave the still body, that was not Sigurd, back toearth. Jack pressed close to his mistress, whose Wallace sleeps nearby, and whined as the box was lowered, while little Esther, beholdingfor the first time a burial, broke into wild crying.In the autumn I stood by the grave, on which the one dear Sister leftin The Orchard had planted violets and periwinkles from Laddie's mound,and watched a kindly young workman set above it a low granite blockinscribed, "Sigurd--Our Golden Collie. 1902-1914." As I strewed thestone with goldenrod and turned away, there echoed on the air ancientwords from the Greek Anthology, "Thou who passest on the path, if haplythou dost mark this monument, laugh not, I pray thee, though it is adog's grave. Tears fell for me."Sigurd would have been well content with the honors that his Collegepaid him,--an obituary notice written with tenderest sympathy, acommemorative letter from his Class of 1911 and many a student elegy.It shall be his own class poet who paints the final picture:    "A dancing collie and gay woodland sprite,      Philosopher, friend, playmate unto each,    Quiet in trial and charming in delight,      Without the doubtful benefit of speech.       *       *       *       *       *    "When snow was over earth and lake and sky,      How often where pale hemlock boughs bent low    Have we beheld his flying shape go by,      An arrow sped from an immortal bow!"TO JOY-OF-LIFE    So that was why our collie went away,      Wise Sigurd, knowing you would come    Ere a new springtide by the valley gray,      Planning to guide you home,    To bark Heaven's earliest welcome, to entice      Those dearest feet the dim glen through,    Then proudly up blithe hills of Paradise      To "find the path" for you.IIOTHER COMRADES OF THE ROADTHE PINE GROVE PATH    Our festal day was yet so young,    As through the pines I came to you,    The level sunrise lightly flung    Before my feet, O eager feet,    A flickering path of flame to you.    The purple finches, breakfasting    On pinecone seeds, in charity    Tossed down the silky scales, to bring    My human heart, O singing heart,    A share of their hilarity.    But gladder than those revelers    So raspberry red, I sped to you,    Beyond the pines, beyond the firs,    A birthday guest, O blissful guest    To tread the path that led to you.ROBIN HOOD    "The little bird with the red breast, which for his great    familiarity with men they call a Robin, if he meet any one on the    woods to go astray, and to wander he knows not whither out of his    way, of common charitie will take upon him to guide him, at least    out of the woods, if he will but follow him, as some think. This I    am sure of, it is a comfortable and sweet companion."    --_Partheneia Sacra_. By "H. A." 1533.The early history of Robin Hood, like that of too many illustriouscharacters, is veiled in obscurity. I never knew his parents nor was Iever on speaking terms with any other member of his family. I cannottell whether his nursery was set in an apple tree or elm or oak orpine, nor whether it was wind or boy or other untoward circumstance ofnestling life that cast his helpless infancy adrift upon the world. Ourearliest knowledge of Robin Hood dates from Sunday morning, June 16,1901, when a group of Wellesley children, demurely wending their way toSunday School across a bit of open green, heard chirps in the grass andpicked up a baby robin, cold, hungry, bedraggled, pecked and generallyforlorn. They took him to Sunday School, muffling him in aspick-and-span small handkerchief when his cries became too shrill and,after this vain attempt at spiritual comfort, gave him to one of theirmammas, who, for several days, managed to sustain him on experimentaldiets. Thursday morning, being about to make her summer exodus, shecheerfully transferred her fosterling to me. Her farewell attention, aspoonful of milk poured down his yawning throat, nearly ended hisadventures on the spot. He turned up his eyes, gasped and stiffened,but with admirable presence of mind she balanced him on his bill, gavehim a dexterous tap in the crop and wiped up the milk from the table,while Robin, blinking ruefully, resigned himself to a nap in my pocket.He woke before we reached home, however, and demanded luncheon soimperiously that I called at the nearest house and begged for bread. Atthe drug store I paused again for water and, to make better connectionbetween this fluid and the depths of that bright orange cavity whichRobin so confidingly opened, I bought a medicine-dropper, but soonfound that a finger-tip would do as well.Owing to these attentions by the way, Robin Hood was in an agreeableand sociable frame of mind when he first met his adopted family, yetall his baby graces gained for him only a mocking reception. He wassuch a dumpy, speckle-breasted fluff, with funny folding legs thatcould not hold him up on the perch, no tail and an utterlydisproportionate amount of bill, that it was impossible to take himseriously, but his trustful little heart never once suspected that wewere making fun of him. He cuddled down cosily on an improvised couchin the corner of a canary cage and devoted himself to a steadyalternation of snoozes and gorges. Everybody laughed at him--the Dryad,who declared him a little monster of greediness and bad manners; thechipmunks, who peered curiously into his cage whenever we left it forsun and air on the piazza; even Joy-of-Life, who promptly sallied outwith a long iron spoon to dig him worms. For Robin Hood would keep onringing his dinner-bell, so to speak, even while the moistened bits ofbread were being thrust down his vociferous throat, ceasing from thathungry clamor only when he was stuffed to the point of suffocation.Then, with a ridiculous little grunt, he would topple off thesupporting hand back to his trundle-bed and doze like a dormouse onlyto awake, in half an hour or so, an utterly famished birdling, all oneyellow gape of tremulous eagerness and outcry.At this stage of development, living to eat, and eating to sleep, Robinwas left for several days in the care of Dame Gentle, kindest ofneighbors, pending the absence of his foster family. Here he was pettedto his babyhood's content and soon evinced a docile, affectionatedisposition. He took a dislike to his cramped canary cage, but now hewas strong enough to perch, and once placed on a chair rung by a handhe trusted, he would sit quiet from one feeding time to the next, oruntil he heard a familiar voice or step. Then, floppity-flop, down tothe floor would tumble Robin and hop joyously to meet his friend. Hesoon had a soft, crooning little note for Dame Gentle, and all thesummer long, while he became a general chatterbox, kept a peculiarlyconfidential accent and manner for her.We resumed our charge on the third of July, but on the Fourth ourattention was somewhat diverted from Robin by the gift of a baby vireo,apparently wounded by a fall from the nest. This green jewel, wild as awindy leaf at first, was soon tamed, but his diet proved a difficultproblem. Robin Hood was only too ready to eat anything and everything,but the tiny vireo, though calling piteously for food, turned his billaway in sore disappointment from our various offerings. He would nottouch the crumbs of softened bread, nor Robin's favorite mess of mashedpotato and hard-boiled egg-yolk. We consulted all our bird-books, andwhen we learned that the case demanded "masticated insects," we satdown and looked at each other in despair. I generously offered to catchany number of insects, if Joy-of-Life would do the masticating, butlittle Liberty Bell finally compromised on a masticated raspberry. Thenext day, mocking-bird food was procured for him, and this he swallowedwith apparent relish, but still he did not thrive.On Sunday, the seventh, an eager troop of children brought to our dooranother fallen vireo, this wee waif seeming in worse state than theother. We named him Church Bell and cherished him as tenderly as ourignorance might, but I hope Cornelia never had half the trouble withher jewels that our pair of emeralds gave us. Their sharp, incessant,querulous pipe, the utterance of pains we could not soothe, was sotrying to the nerves that, when I heard Joy-of-Life dropping books, Iwould transfer the nest from her desk to mine, and when Mary came upwith a message from the grocer to find me spilling ink, she would takethe vireos down to her ironing board and drown their plaints by herlusty voice of song. They were exquisite little creatures to see, andas trustful with us as was Robin himself, but we never had the key totheir mystery. They would cry even in sleep and had hours of violenttrembling. We would sometimes put them in the rough, outdoor cage whichhad been built for Robin, a large, square, unfloored box with roof andwalls of woven wire. He looked big and lubberly beside them, like Puckbeside Oberon and Titania, but he was always good-natured with hisdainty guests and often tried to join in the conversation as they sat,pressed close together, on the far end of the twig which served him fora perch, lamenting like elfin Banshees. A touch of chilly weather endedtheir brief tragedy. Liberty Bell was hushed forever in the dawn ofTuesday, the ninth, and by Wednesday noon Church Bell lay silent besidehim in the rockery which was already the burial cairn of three belovedchickens, Microbe, Pat and Cluxley.Meanwhile Robin Hood had been causing his share of anxiety. Thebirdlings were all so tame that, in feeding them, we used to throw backthat half of the cage-top which served as lid, whereupon they would flyup to the edge of the box and sit there in a row for dinner.Occasionally one of the vireos would flash up into a low tree and wailfor food until we had to bring the step-ladder and fetch him down. Butit was not until Robin's winglets were fairly grown that he seemedaware of the existence of trees. Then, suddenly, one azure afternoon,he glanced up, cocked his head, spread his untried Icarus-plumes andwas off. In instant consternation, the whole family trooped after him,so far as groundlings could, while he flew from tree to tree and roofto roof. Chirping in his affectionate fashion, he peeped down upon uswith evident surprise as if to ask, "Why don't you come, too? It's muchnicer up here." Innocent of mirrors, he probably thought that we lookedjust like him, or that he looked just like us, and he could notunderstand why we chose to be earth-gropers when the leafy branchesswayed so delectably in mid-air. But he was such a social and kindlylittle bird that, on our repeated calls, he came dipping down to usand, without protest of a feather, let himself be shut into his cageagain.Now we were face to face with the question that had already cast itsshadow before. Should we make a life-long captive of our Robin, whotook so pleasantly to human ways, or should we give him the perils anddelights of liberty? Mary's eyes were very wistful, and Joy-of-Life andI reiterated to each other that our house-reared bird would behandicapped in the greenwood struggle for life, that he was necessarilyweaker and less wary than other young robins, that there were whitekittens next door, that a gaunt, gray hunting-cat had been seen lurkingabout the wire box--and yet, all the while, we knew what we must do.    "He who bends to himself a joy    Does the wing?d life destroy;    But he who kisses the joy as it flies    Lives in eternity's sunrise."And so, on the following day, whenever any of us were at leisure toguard our artless adventurer from the dangers of the yard, we set thecage-lid wide and let him go where he would. He made small use of hisprivileges at first. Little runs on the lawn amused him for a while,but he would soon mount to the piazza rail and tease the occupant ofthe steamer chair for food and petting. His hops over the shelving rockbehind the house were feeble; his trips of exploration to theneighboring trees and roofs were brief. He was hardly more than a babyrobin yet and, soon wearied, he would go back into his cage for a napon the familiar perch. An old maternal robin showed much interest inthis lonely, weak-legged youngster, who seemed so unthrifty aboutpicking up ants for himself, but he squealed with fright and flew to uswhenever she approached him. She would stand silently beside the cageand study him through the wire while he slept, but whether she was thematron of a robin-home for crippled children, or one of his kinsfolkpuzzling out a likeness, our bewildered fosterling, whose idea ofmother-birds was formed on Dame Gentle and ourselves, would have, fromfirst to last, nothing to do with her.But one evening, July 7th, just as we had finished giving Robin Hood aparticularly good supper on the edge of his box, he suddenly soared andleft us. The house stands    "About a young bird's flutter from a wood,"and, to our dismay, Robin Hood made thitherwardas if it were Sherwood Forest, disappearedamong the dusky treetops and returned not achirp to all our agitated calling. He had notpassed a night out of doors for the three weeksthat he had been under human guardianship, andwe felt that anything from a fatal chill to a fatalhawk might befall him. But the first sound thatgreeted my waking senses in the morning wasMary's delighted, rich-toned, "Why, Robby!"and there, on top of his cage, sat a hungry, happylittle bird, chirping eagerly and gesticulating withone wing in a funny fashion of his own, peculiarto seasons of excitement.Mary--be it said in passing--was Cecilia's predecessor and for severalyears, at the outset of our housekeeping, gave us a devotion onlysurpassed by her devotion to her own large and lively family. Theylived but a few miles away, in the Boston suburb known as JamaicaPlain, and Mary was subject to violent attacks of homesickness,especially at Christmas, Easter, Hallowe'en and Thanksgiving, so thatwe were usually deprived of her services when we needed them most. Onceat home, she would feast and frolic until she had made herself justsick enough to have a pathetic pretext for prolonging her absence dayafter day. When she turned up at last, her Irish wit would inevitablyforestall and frustrate any little unpleasantness that might beawaiting her. I had mentioned at table one evening, while Mary waschanging the courses, that, lunching with our college president thatday, I had enjoyed luscious grapefruit fresh from the West Indies,"brought her by a private hand from Jamaica." From her next truancyMary returned with a bulging paper bag in her arms, which, even whilemy lips were parting to utter a deeply meditated reproach, she dumpedupon me with her rosy cheeks aglow and her round blue eyes alltwinkles. "Here's grapefruit for yez, brought by a private hand fromJamaica--Plain." The family, waiting about gleefully to hear me deliverthat purposed scolding, broke into a shout of laughter, and the honorsof the day rested, as always, with the culprit.During one of these vacations, intolerably prolonged by excuse afterexcuse, our patience gave way and we availed ourselves of a suddenchance to put in her place, as temporary substitute, a highly competent(and expensive) Scandinavian woman. Thus we entered upon a month ofunparalleled luxury, for Gunilla proved to be a cook of the firstorder. We were quite below her standard of household opulence andelegance, as we realized when she asked us, with her invariable bearingof respectful dignity, if we would kindly tell her where our winecellar was located, but she was disposed to take a rest between greathouses and provided for our simple needs with indulgent efficiency aslong as her whim lasted. Although she had broiled and roasted for agovernor, a bishop, and various magnates of industry, she turned toscrubbing for recreation as naturally as czars and kaisers turn tochopping wood. She beat every particle of dust, after sweeping, out ofbroom and whisk, and before hanging out the clothes, she scoured theline and every astonished clothespin. The sheets and other flat piecessent home from the laundry she straightway plunged into her own tubs.Her pantry shone with obtrusive cleanliness and every dish cameglistening to the stiff, high-lustered table-cloth, where her spicedbreadsticks were cradled in fresh napkins for each dinner. Her kitchenrange fairly dazzled the eye with its sable brightness, and we were soproud of the toothsome concoctions that came crackling and crinklingfrom it as to give, under her smiling encouragement, a ruinous seriesof banquets to our campus friends.Promptly on Gunilla's departure, Mary came charging back to us, firedwith jealous wrath. Indeed, she would talk of little else but theenormities of extravagance committed by "The Gorilla," until RobinHood's advent effected a welcome diversion.For the week following his first venture into the trees Robin grewbraver and stronger every day. He had no feathered acquaintance andkept close at home, hopping about under the rosebushes with a comicalair of proprietorship, bathing in an old flower-pot saucer in his opencage and sitting sociably, for hours at a time, on Joy-of-Life's windowledge or Mary's, or on my window box for winter birds. He could feedhimself by this time, but he still liked better to be fed. His tablemanners showed marked improvement from his "little monster" age. He nolonger guzzled, and was becoming quite capable of picking up his ownliving. Sometimes, when the ants were abundant, he would try theexperiment of self-support for half an afternoon. He was still a veryguileless birdling, and would fall sound asleep squatted down on anysunny shelf of rock or even in the middle of a path, regardless of theprowling tabbies that had already made way with our stonewall colony ofchipmunks. We encouraged him to frequent his safer haunts on roof andwindow box by keeping fresh water and plentiful supplies of mockingbird food ready for him there, but we had to know where he was fromdawn to dark, although the July dawns seemed to come in the middle ofthe night. Morning after morning, not daring to trust our innocent evenwith the early worm, I would slip on dressing-gown and slippers and beout seeking him by three or four. And there, hopping across the alreadyheated concrete, would come skurrying an enthusiastic littlespeckle-breast, flapping one wing in salutation and twitteringindignantly, "Morning! Breakfast! Morning! Breakfast!" as if he hadbeen up reading the newspaper for hours. He would ride trustfully on myhand into the house, take his food and drink, and then contentedly goto sleep again, perched, by preference, on top of a door.But one Saturday morning I called Robin Hood in vain. The air, ringingwith bird-carols, held no music so precious as his hungry chirp.Joy-of-Life was now a thousand miles away, but Mary and Dame Gentlejoined anxiously in the search. We were a distracted household when, ateight, a ruddy young Audubon from the hilltop arrived, bringing in onehand our overjoyed little truant, and in the other another fledglingrobin, with the merest beginnings of a tail--a waif picked up by theroadside. Audubon reported that, as he was busy in his garden, a youngrobin had flown down and alighted at his feet, fluttered there a momentand raised the nestling cry for food. Happy Robin Hood, to have chosenfrom all the boys of Wellesley the one wisest in benignant woodcraft!Audubon slipped quietly to the ground, caught a caterpillar and held itout to Robin, who came fearlessly to his hand and choked the furrydelicacy down. Then Audubon was sure that this was our famed fosterlingand, taking up the unsuspicious little fellow, hastened to bring himdown the hill to his home.The new arrival from the greenwood, whom we dubbed Friar Tuck, promptlybelied that jovial memory. He was a wild, sullen, desperate littleoutlaw, whose chirp was a metallic click and whose bill had to be priedopen before he would eat. Not even Robin Hood's hospitable chattercould dispel his scared, defiant misery, and on the second morning,unable to bear the look he turned up to the trees, we lifted the cagelid and let him fly. We never, to our knowledge, saw Friar Tuck again,and although we often listened for his uncanny chirp, it was notheard--not even by Mary, whose imagination so expanded under theseNatural History studies that she would rush upstairs several times aday to report all manner of rainbow-colored fowl that she haddiscovered in the thickets. By the following winter, her Celtic visionhad soared beyond all bounds. "The cherubs are shoveling snow off theporch of Paradise this morning," I once happened to remark, whereatMary, plumping down the hot coffee-pot helter-skelter, sprang open-eyedand open-mouthed to the window, gazing ecstatically up into the whitewhirl of the storm. "I see thim! I see thim! The shining little dears!It's using their wings for shovels they are, and I see one of theirfeathers afloating down in the snow."As the summer went on, Robin Hood became the pet of the neighborhood.Even Giant Bluff, who had moods of declaring that "what with'Biddy-Biddy' on one side, and 'Robby-Robby' on the other, this hillain't fit for nothin' but females to live on," would bring tidbits toour Speckle, who soon saved him the trouble by making frequent calls atthe front door. A guest of that house used to come to her window in theearly morning and sing him "Robin Adair," while he stood on theopposite roof attentively listening, his head cocked and his bright eyeturned on the serenader.But he was a loyal little soul. He spent much of his time on DameGentle's piazza, and although Joy-of-Life, just before her departure,treating him for asthma--due, the sages said, to an overhearty diet inhis inactive babyhood--had popped an unhappy worm dipped in red pepperdown his throat, yet even this Robin could forgive. It had hurt hisfeelings at the time. He had withdrawn to his best-beloved branch onhis best-beloved oak and maintained an offended silence for half anhour, but with the sting his anger went, and for days afterJoy-of-Life's disappearance, Robin would fly up to her window ledge andchirp to the closed blinds.During this second week of freedom, his experience was enlarged by athunderstorm, which he contemplated with lively astonishment fromwithin my window, but the next morning worms were plentiful, and there,to Giant Bluff's inordinate pride, was Robin trotting about the lawnlike an old hand, turning up bits of turf with a grubby little bill andactually getting his own breakfast.A day or two later our fledgling began to sow wild oats. Thursdayafternoon Mary missed him and, hunting for him beyond the cairn, whichshe designated "The Pets' Cemetery," found him lending charmedattention to a big, red-breasted robin, who dashed off so guiltily thathe bumped himself against the fence. All Friday our Speckle was shy andwild, flying about the edge of the wood with this first friend of hisown feather, but he came to perch on the piazza rail at twilight, asusual, keeping us company while we took our open-air dinner, andresponding to our blandishments with a drowsy chirp. When he soared tochoose his slumber-spray in one of the tall trees before the house, westrained our eyes to follow him into the shadows and called up laughingcounsels and good-nights as long as he would answer. But the nextmorning an evil-eyed black cat sat on our steps and, hour after hour,no Robin Hood appeared. Mary spent most of the forenoon in the woodsand, after luncheon, we both went calling through a leafy world with aBabel of chirps about us. "Thim birds, they're just a-mocking me,"wailed Mary. But suddenly we both heard, hurrying along the air, thatdear, unmistakable baby squawk, and in an instant more our own littleSpeckle came plumping down on my head, where he rode triumphantly intothe house, flapping his funny right wing all the way and gasping withspeed and excitement. He had perhaps been in a fight, for one side ofhis guileless face was badly pecked. Throughout the afternoon hedevoured one full meal after another, allowing ten-minute siestaintervals, with all the enthusiasm of a prodigal son, and then he musthave a bath, and then he must be held and petted, and all thewhile--yep, yep, yep! flop, flop, flop!--he was trying to tell thestory of his terrible adventures. Whatever they were, he was a reformedlittle robin, and spent the Sunday partly on my window box, where hewould play for fifteen minutes together with the nutshells that thechickadees had emptied, and partly under a leafy canopy in the oakwithin easy squirrel-leap beyond, not having a chirp to chirp to anybad bird who would lead him into mischief.For a fortnight longer Robin was our daily joy. It seemed to make usintimates of the woods to hear, as we were walking there, the hail of afamiliar voice from overhead and look up to see our own small Specklepeeping down at us from some breezy twig against the blue. For he soonrecovered from his penitence and went sailing through the trees on everlonger voyages of discovery, being often out of call for two or threehours at a time. But he was always on the window box, where no otherrobin ever came, in the early morning from half-past three on to seven,overflowing with conversation and insisting on intelligent replies tohis remarks. At intervals throughout the day, too, I would hear a softthud on the box, followed by a chirp-p-p and the flap-p-p of a veryimpatient and business-like little wing. On these occasions Robin Hoodwas quite too much occupied with his greenwood affairs to feed himself,and I must needs drop book or pen and cram refreshment down hisimportunate yellow gullet till it could hold no more. Then he would hopacross to his Japanese water-cup, take a dozen eager dips, wipe hisbill first on one side, then the other, on the edge of the box, andthen, flapping his wing for good-by, sweep off again. In the middle ofevery forenoon and, during the hottest weather, of the afternoon aswell, he alighted on his cage and called imperiously to Mary to bringhim fresh water for his bath. We shut him in during this and during hissun-baths, since he enjoyed these rites so much as to be even more thancommonly oblivious of cats.On the evening of July 24 the mercury "dropped on us," as Mary said,some thirty degrees, and a drenching rain fell all night--a newexperience for Robin Hood, who appeared at my window Thursday morning,a draggled little vagabond. Had there been no wise robin at hand toteach him how to take the oil from his back pockets and convert hisairy fluff into a tight-fitting waterproof? He was glad to come in outof the wet and spent the forenoon in Mary's kitchen, letting her fondlehim as she would, but flying with alarm from the proffered caresses ofmarket-man and grocer-boy. In the course of the next few days, however,he began to protest a little when even his old friends stooped to takehim up. He would hop backward, snapping his bill, but he seldom flewand, if the hand did not remain closed upon him, but left him perchingfree on wrist or finger, he was entirely content.On August 8 we did our Robin wrong. An expected dinner guest hadexpressed a desire to see him and, as by this time he was spending hisnights, presumably, in a far-off Robin roost, for which he sometimesstarted early in the afternoon, Mary caught him during the absorbedecstasy of his sun-bath and shut him into the cage. This was still afavorite resort of his, and he did not object in the slightest until ayoung robin playmate with whom he was in the habit of flying to theroost whistled for him from a scarlet oak. Then Robin chirped to us tolet him out, growing frantic with excitement as we, hitherto so promptto obey his behests, made no move for his release. He called and calledagain, beating about the cage and even breaking into a song of wildentreaty. Shame-faced and conscience-stricken, we yet put him off,expecting our guest minute by minute. It was nearly seven when regretswere telephoned, but by that time Robin was in a panic and smote ourhearts by the terror with which he fluttered back from us as we bentover the cage.The instant the lid was raised he whirred up to the scarlet oak, wherehis faithful chum still waited, but before their belated departureRobin flew down to Dame Gentle's window and told her all about it, andthen over to Giant Bluff's piazza, where he rehearsed his grievancesagain in a scolding chirp never heard from him before.We closed the house on the fourteenth and went away, unforgiven byRobin Hood, who has never, so far as I know, come to human hand sinceMary's clasp betrayed him to captivity. During those six days we caughtflying glimpses of our estranged fosterling, easily recognized from adistance by the two white feathers in his tail, and a few times hestarted, by sheer force of habit, to hop across the road to us fromDame Gentle's, but, half-way over, he would turn sharply about, give anangry little yep, and hop back again.When we reopened the house in late September, not even Dame Gentle hadrecent news of Robin Hood, and all the winter long we carried asorrowful sense of broken friendship. We were anxious about ourhand-reared birdling, too, hardly daring to hope that he could survivethe perils of migration. What a desperate adventure it seemed!    "Who hath talked to the shy bird-people,    And counseled the feathered breast    To follow the sagging rain-wind    Over the purple crest?"But on the sixth day of March Robin Hood came home. There had been ababy blizzard the night before and, as we returned from college in theearly afternoon, I noticed birdtracks in the light snow that stillmantled the piazza rail."See those prints, right where Robin Hood used to sit and watch us takeour supper!" I exclaimed, a wild hope knocking at my heart, butJoy-of-Life thought it a case of hungry tree sparrows and, with herespecial tenderness for the plucky, one-legged fox sparrow that hadconsorted with them all winter, went in to find them a choice handfulof scraps. But when, a few minutes later, I entered my chamber, thereoutside his accustomed window, on the feeding-box now drifted over withsnow, sat a great, plump, glossy redbreast, staring into the room withRobin's own bright eyes and cocking his head to listen to our welcome.He fluttered back to the nearest tree, when we opened the window,indicating that he had learned a thing or two, in the gossip of thelong aerial journeys, about the human race, nor did he ever again enterthe house nor let us touch him, but he kept close by, for weeks,perching in his old familiar places on roof and rail and window-ledge,hopping in our walks and gamboling in our eyes. Out in the open, hewould come within a few inches of us and there take his stand and chirpthe confidences that we would have given all our dictionaries tocomprehend. He was such a tall, stately robin, with such an imposingair of travel and experience as he stood erect, swelling his brightbreast with the effort to relate his Winter's Tale, that Joy-of-Liferechristened him Lord Bobs.In course of time our gallant fledgling appeared in company with amate, most disappointing to our romantic anticipation,--a fadedcrosspatch old enough to be his grandmother, a very shrew who scoldedhim outrageously whenever she saw him lingering beside us. She told himwe were ogres, alligators, everything that was horrible and dangerous,and threatened to peck out his last pin-feather unless he flew awayfrom us at once. A selfish old body she was, too, monopolizing therock-bath, as if she were taking a cure for rheumatism, whole hours ata time, while Robin Hood, hot and dusty, waited on her pleasure in thedrooping branches above. But despite her shrill remonstrances, he wouldstill visit the window box, perching on Downy Woodpecker's marrow-bonefor an opera stage and trilling his matins and vespers to our delightedears. We were as proud of Robin Hood's singing as if we had taught himourselves. Between his carols our troubadour would take a littlerefreshment, trying in turn Nuthatch's lump of suet, Bluejay's rinds ofcheese, Junco's crumbs and his own mocking-bird food, or quaffing rainwater from Chickadee's nutshell cups. He would sometimes hop to thesill and, close against the glass, watch all the doings in that worldwhich lay about him in his infancy. We looked forward to an hour whenhe might bring his own little speckles to play, as he had loved toplay, with the empty nutshells, but Mrs. Robin hustled him off to thewoods for the nesting season and we were never able after that firstspring to distinguish him with certainty among our robin callers. Nonethe less he had made the summer and all summers happier for us by hisgracious though guarded pardon for our unkindness.    "Truth never fails her servant, sir, nor leaves him    With the day's shame upon him,"and even over wild-bird tradition and matrimonial tyranny the truth ofour love for Robin Hood, its single lapse forgiven, had prevailed.WHY THE SPIRE FELL    Our Emperor built a marble church    So holy never a bird might perch    On cross or crocket or gilded crown,    A fretted minster of far renown,    But still the spire came crashing down.    _They stoned the swallow and limed the lark;    A rosy throat was an easy mark;    The tiniest wren that built her nest    In Christ's own halo, on Mary's breast,    Was scared away like a demon guest._    Once, twice, thrice, the glistening spire    That soared from the central tower, higher    Than all its clustered pinnacles, fell,    And not one of the carven saints could tell    The cause, though the emperor quizzed them well.    Down in the cloister all strewn with chips    Of alabaster and ivory tips    Of pastoral staffs and angel wings,    In a rainbow ruin of sacred things    He held high court in the way of kings.    _All the while in a royal rage    He pelted with fragments of foliage,    Curly acanthus and vineleaf scroll,    Finial, dogtooth and aureole,    The linnets and finches who came to condole._    Crowned with a cobwebby cardinal's hat    That swooped from the vaulted roof like a bat,    On a tilted porphyry plinth for a throne,    The emperor summoned in thunder tone    The hallowed folk of metal and stone.    Martyrs, apostles, one and all,    Tiptoed down from the quaking wall;    Crusaders, uncrossing their legs of brass,    Sprang from their tombs; over crackle of glass    Balaam rode on a headless ass.    But not one of the sculptured cavalcade    Flocking from choir and creamy fa?ade,    Deep-arched portal and pillared aisle    Had a word on his lips, though all the while    Gentle St. Francis was seen to smile.    _Whistles, chuckles, warbles tried    To give the answer the saints denied;    Gurgles, tinkles, twitters, trills,    Carols wild as wayward rills    Troubadouring daffodils._    St. Peter, high in his canopied niche    Set with jewels exceeding rich,    Was dancing a hornpipe over the clock,    But before the gargoyles had time to mock    From his shoulder crowed St. Peter's cock.    "_Kirikiree!_ Creative Love    That folds the emperor folds the dove.    No church is finished, though grand it be,    That lacks the beauty of charity.    Buttress your spire. _Kirikiree!_"    So our Emperor reared the spire anew,    Yon shaft of glory that cleaves the blue,    Held in its place by the lightest things    God ever fashioned, the wee, soft wings    Of the birds that join in our worshipings.AN EASTER CHICK    "Only, what I feel is, that no charity at all can get rid of a    certain natural unkindness which I find in things themselves."    --Pater's _Marius the Epicurean_.The grippe had held me a prostrate prisoner for weeks. Books, pencils,people were forbidden. It was a strange but not unhappy Lent to liehelpless day after day, gazing through my blessed square of window intoa first snowy, then blowy, often rainy and rarely sunshiny patch ofwoodland, watching the brown oak leaves whirl in hurricane dances abovethe pine-tops, and the crows wing their strong flight against the grayof the sky. As a cumberer of the earth, I was meekly grateful for theleast attention from this active outdoor world, for the cheery pipingsof the chickadees, whose wee black bills pounded the marrow-bone on thewindow-sill, for the guttural greetings of the white-breastednuthatches who played the acrobat on the swinging, open-work bag ofcracked walnuts outside the pane, even for the jeers of the bluejayswho swooped to the sash and dashed off like triumphant Dick Turpinswith our bounty of bread and cheese.So Joy-of-Life, hearing of a Boston confectioner's pious offer tobestow an Easter chicken on every customer who should alleviate thefast by the purchase of two pounds of expensive candies at any timeduring Holy Week, thought she would add to my feathered acquaintance amore intimate companion. Herself an abominator of sweets, sheheroically passed a dollar and a half across the counter and receivedin exchange, beside two boxes of riotous living, a tiny chick, only aday or so out from egg and incubator.It was pretty, she said, to see the interest with which the tiredshop-girls bent over that fluffy morsel of life, petting it with lighttouches and soothing words, as it was tucked away, with Indian meal forprovender and a wad of cotton-wool for bedding, in a gay pasteboardhouselet. The color of this miniature mansion was russet flecked withblack. The door was a painted sham, but the red-tiled roof swung open.The window boasted four oblong apertures, and the whole establishmentwas symmetrically set in a half-inch estate of the reddest pasteboardclay. The girl made the roof secure with a few turns of silver cord andthe captive was reduced to thrusting an indignant yellow bill throughone after another of his window openings, expostulating with allcreation in a series of shrill chirps. As the customer stepped out withher premium in hand, the candy-coveting group of ragamuffins outsidethe window surged forward in rapture at sight and sound of the chicken,and one particularly grimy urchin reached up both arms toward it withsuch an imploring gesture that the birdling almost changed ownershipthen and there. But Joy-of-Life bethought herself in time of theconditions of tenement and alley, not favorable to the development ofany sort of biped, and said:"It is for a sick lady. Don't you want her to have it?"And the tatterdemalion slowly dropped his wistful hands, sighingdutifully, "Yes, m'm."The chicken-bearer's dignified progress, "cheep, cheep, cheep," acrossthe Common and Public Gardens and through the Back Bay section,afforded her a new gauge for testing human nature. Colonial Dames wholooked an aristocratic rebuke she put lower in the scale of sympathythan the Italian organ-grinder whose black eyes laughed frankly intohers, while the maid who opened a door in Newbury street, whereJoy-of-Life had a call to make, fell with her shocked, contemptuousstare quite under passing rank.It was late in the evening before I heard upon the stairs a welcometread, mounting to that queer accompaniment of cheep, cheep, cheep, nowpitched upon a key, had we but ears to hear, of acute distress. Mydelight in greeting the chicken was not reciprocated, and no wonder.Our unconscious, ignorant crimes against his frail little being hadalready begun. Joy-of-Life, ever most tender toward the weak, enjoyed,moreover, the advantage of having been reared upon a farm, where shehad often watched the life of coop and poultry-yard, but not even shewas wise enough to give that chicken comfort.She had carefully seen to it, all the journey through, that he hadoxygen enough. The March wind blew so harshly that she had wanted toshelter the fairy chalet under her cloak, but had feared that theyellow bill, forever thrusting itself through the small casement, wouldgasp for air. Air! That is the least of a chicken's wants. With all hisbaby energy, Microbe, as we promptly christened him, had called forheat, heat, heat, and had not been understood. Those thin pasteboardwalls and that shred of cotton-wool had left him practically naked tothe blast, and he was chilled--poor innocent--to the bone.And still, in our big, human obtuseness, we did not comprehend. Webrought him meal mixed with cold water--an atrocious diet from which heangrily turned away. All at cross purposes, we flattered him foolishlyin our alien tongue, while he remonstrated passionately in his. At lastthe warmth of the room and very weariness quieted that incorrigiblecheep a little, and he was put downstairs out of invalid hearing, witha strip of batting cast, like a snowdrift, over his jaunty dwelling.The family went snugly to bed, while the furnace fire burned lower andlower and the chill of the small hours stole through the house. A lessmettlesome chicken, overwhelmed with the loneliness and cruel cold,would have yielded up its accusing little ghost then and there, butthis mite had a marvelous spirit of his own and struggled against fatelike a De Wet.In that heavy hour before the dawn, Joy-of-Life was roused from sleepby such desperate chicken shrieks, "Yep, yep, yep! Help, help, help!"that no doors could shut them out. Shivering in her dressing-gown shewent down to our unhappy fosterling, who lay stiff and straight, withhead thrust forward and legs stretched back, apparently _in articulomortis_. The rigid bit of body was cold to her touch, and the onlyhopeful sign was that shrill, protesting chirp, into which allremaining vitality seemed to be forced. Holding the downy ballcompassionately between her palms, this ineffectual giantess--fromMicrobe's point of view--reflected on the possibilities of thesituation only to be baffled. The kitchen fire was out, the oven hadnot a hint of warmth in it, there was no hot water for the rubber bag.Besides, the chicken seemed too far gone for restoration, and sheguiltily smothered him away under the fold of cotton batting andretreated to her chamber. But Microbe had by no means surrendered hissacred little claims to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Thepersistent prick of his muffled, frantic cries drove sleep from herpillow. She rose once more and, by inspiration, carried the diminutivemansion down cellar, where she placed it on top of the furnace!Instantly the genial heat reached that exhausted chick, who had battledfor it so valiantly and long. The white-barred lids slipped up over theround black eyes--for chickens literally "shut their peepers up"--andhe was asleep before his rescuer had turned away.Joy-of-Life did not believe such a day-old atom of mortality couldsurvive this woeful night. She came to my bedside at the breakfast hourand prepared me solemnly for word of Microbe's premature decease. Butlittle did we know as yet the meaning of that maligned phrase"chicken-hearted." She descended at a funereal pace to the cellar, butwith the sound of her swift returning feet I laughed to hear, clearerfrom stair to stair, an eager, spirited little pipe, "Chip, chip, chip!What's up now? Where are we going on this trip, trip?"Such a wide-awake, enterprising speck of poultry it was thatJoy-of-Life proudly set upon the counterpane! He gave prompt proof ofhis activity by scrambling madly for my plate, and fluttered down, withyellow winglets spread, exactly in the center of my slice of toast."It's spring chicken on toast he's giving yez," cried our delightedMary, and in honor of that ready display of Irish humor, his name wasforthwith abbreviated to Mike.Then he hopped up into my neck, cuddled down, sang a little, contentedsong and went off to sleep again, waking to find himself the ruler ofthe roost.Word of our mutual devotion went abroad and forthwith the criticsbegan. A high-minded friend sent word that if she heard of my lavishingany more affection on that ridiculous little rooster, she would comeand wring his yellow neck, and even the Madre herself, she who hadborne with my foibles longest and most indulgently, wrote in a flash ofscandalous uncharity that she wished I would rest content with the wildbirds that God had made, and not waste attention on an illegitimate,incubator chicken.But "God be with trewthe qwer he be!" The foolish fact is that, in therestlessness of convalescence, when work and worry, thought andhumanity must still be shooed from the threshold, I found hourly mirthand comfort in that dot of sunshine. The phenomenal mists and rains ofthis first April of the new century caused such a dearth of goldenlights in the world that a yellow chicken acquired peculiar values. Thefurnace-man said he was a Wyandotte and, as a feminine household, weinvariably put absolute faith in the word of our furnace-man. I do notknow how Wyandottes ought to look, but I know that this was adaffodil-colored mite, with legs and feet more slender than chickenwont, and with a hundred diverting, confiding, tyrannical little ways.I never ceased marveling at the pluck with which this Lilliputiantackled life in the midst of such Brobdingnagian surroundings. The onlytime I ever saw him scared was when a guest, so well acquainted withchickens as to venture on personal liberties, flourished her glove overthe graveled box that served poor little Mike for his Earthly Paradise."Squawk! squawk!" he cried in an agitated pipe I had not heard before,and scrabbled wildly to the shelter of my hand, nestling out of sightunder the palm in his favorite fashion."Did you hear him call hawk, hawk?" asked my erudite visitor. "We havean old biddy at home who nurses a grudge against me this week because Iwill not let her set, and the last time I went out into the henyard, ifshe didn't scream hawk, hawk, just like that, and send the chickensscuttling to cover under the barn! The hateful thing! She knew howinsulted I would feel to be taken for a hawk!"But apart from that trying occasion, Mike was a scrap of valor. Nomember of the family was tall enough to disconcert him. He peckedwhatever he saw, from his own feet to the register, and would pouncelike a baby pirate upon objects many times larger than himself,cheeping to the world his tidings of magnificent discovery. I am nopastoral linguist, but I learned the rudiments of chicken language fromMike, who was such a chatterbox that he twittered in his sleep.Meal-times, which he liked to have occur every hour from dawn to dark,brought out his conversational fluency at its best. We tried manyexperiments with his diet, in obedience to many counselors. We weretold that his Indian meal should be mixed with scalding water, that hewas too young for this hearty dish and should be fed with dry oatmeal,that minute crumbs of bread would comfort his crop, that larger bits ofbread, kindly masticated in advance, were better, that sour milk wasessential, mashed potato indispensable, string beans a plausiblesubstitute for angle-worms, that he must be given a chance to swallowgravel to assist the grinding in his wee gizzard mill, and that hiscereals should be discreetly spiced with grubs and lettuce leaves andsuch spring dainties. Whatever we were told to do, we did. Mike'srepasts were thus seasons to him of delicious excitement, and he wouldtear deliriously from one end of his box to the other, pecking to rightand left, exclaiming in high glee, "Tweet, tweet! Something to eat!Bless my pin-feathers! Here's a treat!"This up-to-date son of an incubator had an obstinate instinct in himwhich made the tap of my finger on the floor of his box equivalent tothe tattoo of a hen's bill beside some scratched-up delicacy, and itwas funny to see him rush to the sound, his black eyes shining withjoyous expectancy. So queerly did instinct serve him that he would grabthe goody as if a brood of famished brothers were on his heels and,spreading his bits of wings, race off with his prize, most indiscreetlyshrilling as he went, "Twit, twit, twit! You shan't have a bit," andgobbling it down in a corner with choking precipitation.One of the "Arrows of the Wise" carries the point, "Be not idle and youshall not be longing," and I had no chance to miss my customaryvocations with this importunate cockerel demanding constant society andcare.Hatched to the vain anticipation of brooding wings and crooning cluckand the restless pressure of other downy little bodies all about him,Mike was a lonesome chick and could not bear to have his sorrysubstitute for a mother-hen out of sight and sound a minute. His boxmust be within reach of my hand, whither every few minutes he would runfor a snuggle and a snooze, turning a disdainful back on the elaboratehot-water-bottle and cotton-batting shelters I had been at such painsto erect. The life in him craved contact with life. If I withdrew myhand, having occasionally other uses for it, or neglected to respond tohis casual remarks, my ears would suddenly be assailed by a storm ofpiteous chirps, the neck would stretch until two round eyes peeredanxiously above his castle wall, and then, with clamber and scramble,that indomitable little spirit would achieve the impossible and land afluttering fluff-ball against my face. When I was well enough to movefrom room to room Mike would dare the most terrific rumbles from hisbox to come chasing after, though every threshold was a toweringobstacle over which a Labor Union of wings and legs could barely carryhim.After he had eaten his supper, with undiminished enthusiasm, and haddrunk his fill from a butter-plate, lifting his yellow bill to heavenwith every drink, and giving thanks, as all good chickens do, we usedto tuck him away in a basket. At first we buried him deep under a lightmass of cotton-wool, from the precise center of whose surface his headwould shine out in the morning like a star set in fleecy clouds; butthe chief of our advisory council warned us that the films might getinto his eyes and down his gullet with disastrous results, andsuggested instead the use of a retired table-scarf. Chicken in thecloth, cloth in the basket, basket on the register, the family wouldcompose itself to listen to the "Life of Huxley," while the softest,drowsiest nest song, "Tweety-tweet! Tweety-tweet!" from the depths ofthe table-scarf accompanied the voice of the reader. The elfinmusic-box would fall silent presently, but when bedtime came, andJoy-of-Life, before taking the basket down cellar to hang it near thefurnace for the night, brought it to me that I might ask, no matter howquietly, "All well, Mike?" a dreamy little note would instantly floatback, "Tweety-tweet! Sleeping sweet!"We grew so fond of our pet as to dislike to see him deprived of thenatural companionship of chickenhood, and two other downy midgets--aPenciled Brahmapootra, the gift of the market-man, and a Plymouth Rock,from the Lady of Cedar Hill--were procured to bear him company. Thefirst we dubbed Patience, as the proper associate of a Microbe, butthis beautiful little fowl, whose golden face and delicately stripedbody gave it a wild-bird look, developed such shillalahcharacteristics, especially when Mike made off with the choice morsels,that his name was speedily curtailed to Pat. The Plymouth Rock wascalled Cluxley, in memory of our evening readings; but a meek,illogical, not to say unscientific henny-penny she proved, who wouldstand gazing on a dainty until one of her foster-brothers had snatchedit up and then industriously go and scratch for it in all the placeswhere it never could have been. Pat was a self-reliant, material-mindedyounker, and we let him go his own lively way, with the minimum ofhandling, but our brown Cluxley was of a clinging disposition and hadan embarrassing habit of imperiling her life by stealthy excursions uploose sleeves. Mike did not welcome these birds of his own feather anytoo cordially and held somewhat aloof from them to the end. One of mystudents sent in a pair of dainty blue slippers, fortunately too small,as thus my conscience was clear in devoting them to the welfare of myimmediate brood; but I always had to see to it that Mike and Pat tooktheir siestas in separate slippers, where they would drowsily fluteaway in musical rivalry. Cluxley, with her customary indiscretion,bestowed herself one day in a damp rubber for her nap and caught a badcold, which we successfully doctored with hempseed.Mike had begun to show signs of feathers and once he tried to crow. Hehad become less dependent on me for intimate society, his attentionbeing much taken up with thwarting Pat's designs on the tidbits, but hecould by no means dispense with me as general protector. If I were inthe room, or close beside them in a steamer chair out of doors, he waswilling to ramble a bit with Pat and Cluxley, always taking the lead,but I could not slip away and leave them, even in Mary's charge,without immediate consternation, protest and pursuit on Microbe's part.He was such a humanized chicken, coming at the call of his name, lovingto eat from the finger, cocking his little head so sagely when he wasaddressed and politely cheeping a response, that he became perilouslyattractive to the children of the neighborhood. Sturdy schoolboys wouldkiss his yellow softness on the sly and we often had to rescue him fromthe unskillful clutch of loving childish hands.When a luncheon was brought to me out of doors, all three chickenswould come winging and scrabbling up the rug that wrapped the sorceressof the steamer-chair and dispose themselves about the edge of the tray,chirping continuous amens to the grace steeped in ancient witchcraft:    "Spread, table, spread.    Meat, drink and bread.    Ever may I have    What I ever crave,    When I am spread.    Meat for my black cock,    And meat for my red."Now that I was to be seen outside the house with my little brood,kindly neighbors came from all sides with offers of more chickens, butmy family cares were already heavy for a convalescent, and experiencehad taught me that                               "true happiness    Consists not in the multitude of friends,    But in the worth and choice."Occasional misgivings as to the future crossed my mind. I had oftenseen reposing sheep blocking up the doorways of Andalusianhomes,--Easter lambs given, all gay with ribbons, to the children theyear before and still withheld by family affection from their naturaldestiny of mutton. The Dryad looked forward with glee to my appearanceon the academic platform with three full-grown fowls roosting on theback of my chair or stalking up and down the desk, picking up bits ofchalk and pencil whittlings, but such embarrassments were not to be.Mike was the first to sicken. His name may have been against him or thelong confinement in the basket may have injured him. The table-scarfmay have been too heavy to admit of his standing and moving during thenight as a chicken should. He suddenly became crippled, as withparalysis. One morning, although he breakfasted with abundant relish,he insisted on hiding in my hand immediately after. I wanted him to runabout for exercise, and twenty times put him back into his box, but hereturned to me twenty-one and had his own way for a while, until Maryplayed the kidnapper. Coming down stairs half an hour later I heard herremonstrating with Mike, who was cheeping wildly."Faith, Mike, ye're that onraysonable I can't plaze yez any how.There's Pat and Cluxley as good as clover in the kitchen, but I let yezinto the dining-room, and still ye're discontinted, and now I've letyez into the parlor, Mike, and not the parlor is good enough. Whativeris it that ye can be wanting?"Poor Chicken Little! He heard my voice and started to meet me, but withsuch hobbling, staggering, bewildered steps that, at last, thethreshold overthrew him. We did for him what we knew--and we knewnothing--that day and the next, and he sang his tuneful tweety-tweet onMonday night; but on Tuesday morning, a fortnight from his coming, whenI asked for my chicken, they brought me a ghastly little form lyingamong primroses.I might say that I met the loss of my tiny comrade with adult dignityand composure, but    "Syr, for lying, though I can do it,    Yet am I loth for to goo to it."The core of my grief is the sense that my blundering devotion cutshort, on the very edge of spring, that gallant little life whichbrought help to me in my heavy hour, and which had in it all thepromise of a Chaucer chanticleer.In deep humiliation, we forthwith gave Pat and Cluxley over to higherintelligence than ours, to a neighbor's hen who had no narrow parentalprejudices, but amply gathered them in with her own brood. Pat was thebeauty of the coop, but in a day or so his legs began to waver and sinkunder him, and he, too, never knew a Maytime. Cluxley was always thebelated one and outlived him some three days, but on the fourth morningshe went staggering into the undiscovered realm.People say, "But you did well to keep your Easter chicken alivefourteen days. If the truth were known, you would find that very few ofthose candy-sale chickens hold out so long as that. We bought one forthe children, but it was dead before Sunday. It is next to impossibleto raise chickens by hand, even with experience. As to the ducklingsthat are coming into fashion for Easter gifts, they die sooner thanchickens."Then to our moral, for Mike's small story surely has a moral, though itdoes not matter in the least to Mike. I have no delusions there.                      "All men are    Philosophers to their inches,"but chickens' inches are so very few that there is no room for altruismin their philosophy. Yet the thought of how much these wee innocentsmay suffer from the incompetence of those who so lightly assume theirfostering urges a protest against keeping Easter, the Festival of Life,by such wanton sacrifice of life. How can we reproach the Spaniards,who celebrate their Easter by the merciless bullfight, while we permitthis cruelty to tender chickenhood?A chicken's death is not more trivial than a sparrow's fall. St.Francis of Assisi would have cared.But beneath it all lies the old, dark problem of creature existence.They are so ready to trust and love us, these feathered and furredcompanions of ours on the strange, bright star that whirls us allthrough the vast of ether to an unknown rhythm, and we, with a lordlyselfishness that scoffs at question, slaughter them for our food andclothing, hunt them for our sport, make them our drudges in peace andour victims in war. I can never forget the eyes of a calf that ran tome from his butcher in Norway,--of a kid that I saw struggling awayfrom the knife on Passover eve in Palestine. Yet such is the order ofthe earth. All carnivorous creatures prey upon the weaker. Water andwood and field and air are but varying scenes of the unpausing tragedy.Why, if it must be so, were these doomed animals endowed with the awfulgift of suffering? And what recompense, even in the far reaches ofeternity, can their Creator make to these myriad martyrs for theirgriefs and tortures? Is He the God of Hardy's _The Dynasts_, carelessof mortal agonies? There dwelt a truer God in Shelley's heart, the _corcordium_ of him who wrote:    "I wish no living thing to suffer pain."HOW BIRDS WERE MADE    Above his forests bowed the Spirit, dreaming    Of maize and wigwams and a tawny folk    Who should rejoice with him when autumn broke    Upon the woods in many-colored flame.    Pale birches, maples gleaming    In splendor of all gold and crimson tints,    And dark-green balsams with their purple hints    Of cones erect upon the stem, awoke    In his deep heart,    Though thought had yet no words,    Beauty no name,    Creative longing for a voice, a song    Blither than winds or brooklet's tinkling flow,    His own joy's counterpart.    He breathed upon the throng    Of wondering trees, and lo!    Their leaves were birds.    The birds do not forget, but love to fellow    The trees whose shining colonies they were;    Else wherefore should the scarlet tanager    Fling from the oak his proud, exultant flush    Of music? Why mid yellow    Sprays of the willow by her empty nest    Lingers the golden warbler? Softly drest    In autumn buffs and russets, chorister    Sweetest of all,    Angel of lonely eves,    The hermit thrush    Haunts the November woodland. In them bides    Memory of that far time, ere eyes of men    Had seen the tender fall    Of shadow or the tides    Of silver sunrise, when    The birds were leaves.TAKA AND KOMA    "What madness is it to take upon us to know a thing by that it is    not? Shall we perswade our selves that wee know what thing a Camell    is, because wee know it is not a Frogge?"    --Barckley's _Felicitie of Man_. 1603.To console me for the loss of the chicks, Joy-of-Life went into aBoston bird-store one day and, in defiance of all her principles andmine, bought me a Japanese robin. When she presented him, the daintiestlittle fellow, mouse-color, with touches of red and gold on wings andthroat and the prettiest pink bill, I met her guilty look with one ofsheer astonishment.    "A Robin Redbreast in a cage    Puts all Heaven in a rage,"I quoted."But he was in a cage already," she weakly apologized, "and we'll bevery good to him.""Good jailers!""But liberty here would be his undoing, and I can't take him over toJapan. Come! It's time that you said thank-you."But Taka, named after a Japanese boy of Joy-of-Life's earlieracquaintance, proved a dubious blessing. He was in angry temper fromthe first, and a brilliant new cage, fitted up with all the modernconveniences and latest luxuries, failed to appease him in the least.He would thrust his head between the gilded bars so violently that hecould not draw it back, and while we were doing our clumsy best toextricate him he would peck our fingers with furious ingratitude. Heupset his porcelain dishes, declined to use his swing and, as a rule,rejected all the attractions of his criss-cross perches, flutteringback and forth and madly beating against the bars or huddling in anunhappy little bundle on the floor. It was a matter of weeks before wecould coax him into conversation, and then his abrupt, metallic chirpswere so sharp that Mary, who scorned and disliked him as a foreigner,was scandalized."Don't ye talk with him. It's all sauce that Jap is giving yez."Even Robin Hood, social little fellow that he was, tried in vain, lateron, to make friends with this ungracious stranger. The East and theWest could not meet. In response to Robin's cheery chatter, Taka wouldbristle, turn away and maintain a stubborn silence.I used to carry his cage out of doors with me and set it up on thebank, where crocuses followed snowdrops, and tulips followed crocuses,beside the steamer-chair, hoping that he would feel more at home amidthe blossoms and bird music of the spring. But there little Lord Sulkswould sit, bunched into a corner of his palace, deigning no responsewhatever to the soft greetings of the bluebirds, those "violets ofsong," nor to the ecstatic trills of the fox sparrows, nor even to theringing challenge of Lieutenant Redwing, as he flashed by overhead onhis way to Tupelo swamp.A calling ornithologist examined Taka carefully and concluded that hewas an old bird, although the dealer had glibly represented him asbeing in the very pink of youth. So our poor prisoner was perhaps notborn in captivity and may have had more than ancestral memories ofspreading rice fields, tea plantations and holy bamboo groves. Ourbrave blue squills, our sunny forsythias, our coral-tinted laurelscould not break his dream of flushing lotus and flaming azalea. Whatwas our far-off glimpse of silvery Wachusett to the radiant glories ofsea-girt Fujiyama? I hinted that a pet monkey might solace hisnostalgia, but to such suggestion Joy-of-Life remained persistentlydeaf.The children of the neighborhood found him, sullen though he was, acenter of fascination, and would crowd about his cage, pointing out toone another the jewel tints in his plumage."Cutest bird I ever seed 'cept the flicker," pronounced Snippet, whosestraw-colored hair stood out like a halo."Chickadees are nicer'n flickers," protested wise little GoodyFour-Eyes. "A chickadee eats three hundred cankerworms in a day andover five thousand eggs--when he can get 'em."The boys gave a choral snort."Who does the countin'?" demanded Punch."Wish _I'd_ been born with all the learnin' in me," scoffed Snippet.But Goody, who had gathered many a pinecone for our feeding-boxes and,her snub nose pressed snubbier yet against the window pane, had watchedthe black-capped rolypolies twitch out the winged seeds, stood herground."Does, too," she averred stoutly. "Boys don't know about birds. Theystone 'em.""And girls wear feathers in their hats.""I don't, but Snippet's mamma does.""Doesn't neither. She jes' wears regrets on Sunday.""You don't say it right, but you're nothin' but a small boy.""I'm seven," blustered Snippet, "and I think I'd be eight by now, if Ihadn't had the measles.""Where's Taka?" I exclaimed.In the jostling of the children about the cage, the door, accidentallyor not, had been slipped ajar, and Taka, taking advantage of the heatof the discussion, had escaped.The youngsters raised a whoop that might well have scared him to thePacific, but not the stir of a bird-wing could be perceived anywhereabout.Cats!"Run to the house, Punch, please, and call out everybody to help usfind Taka."I had selected Punch as the boy of longest legs, forgetting hispartiality for Mary's doughnut jar. He chose the route through thepantry with the result that when, after a suspiciously long interval,the rescue party arrived, Mary was dancing with wrath."Shure," she panted, "that gossoon would be a good missenger to sindfor Death, for he wouldn't be after gitting him here in a hurry at allat all."We hunted and we hunted and we hunted. We hunted high in the trees,which the boys and Goody, too, climbed with an activity that surprisedthe woodpeckers; we hunted low in the grass, interrupting a circle ofsquirrels gathered around a toadstool, as around a birthday cake; butno sign of Taka. We searched hedges and shrubbery, but no Taka. Wechirped and we whistled, though well aware that even if Taka heard ushe would not answer.The western sky was a brighter red than Goody's hair-ribbon before wesat ourselves down, discouraged, on the piazza steps to wait forJoy-of-Life.One by one the children had been summoned home, all but Wallace. He hadby telephone directed his parents, who used to be older than he butwhom he now watched over with solicitude, to eat their supper withouthim and go to bed as usual in case he should be detained."I don't like to think of that little goldy head out in the big darkall night," I said."Maybe a star will suppose it's another star and come down and staywith it," suggested Wallace, trying to buttress my sagging courage."His winglets are so wild and so weak.""I believe the other birds know where he is. Please tell us," entreatedWallace, addressing a solemn crow that had just flapped over from thewood to a neighboring fence-post."Now it's no use to be asking of His Riverence," put in Mary. "All thecrows were prastes once and they talk only the Latin."It was one of Joy-of-Life's miracles. It was almost dark when, tiredand hungry, she came home from Boston,--from a committee meeting ofphilanthropists who had been quarreling as only philanthropists can.She looked into Taka's empty cage, stayed but for a glass of milk and afew inquiries as to our field of search, and then, taking an electrictorch, slipped softly into Giant Bluff's cherished tangle of luxuriantrosebushes, where the rest of us had not dared to venture. In a fewminutes she emerged, scores of irate briars catching at her clothes andhair. She was crooning as she came out and in her safe clasp nestled asleepy little bird.Soon after this episode, Joy-of-Life went west for her summer sojournamong the birds at a Wisconsin lake, leaving to Mary, Robin Hood andmyself the guardianship of that forlorn mite. He was as obstinate asever in his lonesomeness, always pettishly rebuffing the friendlyadvances of Robin and, though I would take his cage to the vicinity ofbird after bird, hoping that in some one of these he might recognize akindred spirit, he found nothing of his feather. The white-breastednuthatch, after nearly two months of absence, presumably for therearing of a brood in leafy seclusion, returned for a call at thefeeding-box, looking as genteel as ever in his tailor-made gray suit,but so preoccupied with domestic memories that at first he would saynothing but "Spank! spank! spank!" I brought Taka to the window and helooked on disdainfully while I tried to win Nuthatch back to his winterphrase of "Thank! thank! thank!" Only once did he revert to bachelorfreedom of expression. That was when he fluttered up to the nutmeat bagand found it dangling empty:"What a prank, prank, prank, to rob my bank, bank, bank! oh, theoffense is rank, rank, rank!"At this explosion of resentment Taka gave an involuntary chirp, andNuthatch, the most inquisitive and alert of all our bird visitors,looked the stranger over keenly before he retorted with shockingrudeness, "You're a crank, crank, crank," and flew off to see what thebrown creeper, zigzagging wrong side up about the rough-barked trunk ofan old oak, was finding good to eat.Once I carried Taka well out into the wildwood, but he was notinterested in any of its busy tenants,--not in little Chippy, who allbut pushed his russet crown between the bars of the cage, nor inYellow-Hammer, stabbing the ground for ants, nor in                                  "yonder thrush,    Schooling its half-fledged little ones to brush    About the dewy forest."At last, one afternoon, after Taka had been moping for hours in deepergloom than usual, I impulsively held up a hand-glass before him. Assoon as the solitary caught sight of that other Japanese robin he brokeout into excited chirps and twitters, and suddenly, to my astonishment,caroled forth a ravishing song. I hastily put the glass away, but hebegan calling, calling, calling with a wistful eagerness that could notbe endured. He kept it up till dark and began it again at dawn, sohopefully, so yearningly, that, principles or no principles, there wasonly one thing to do.I went into Boston that morning and, stopping at a Japanese store,asked their word for robin."K?ma-d?ri, or Little Bird, usually called Koma, the Little One."So on I fared to the bird-dealer's and bought Koma for Joy-of-Life. Hewas the only Japanese robin they had left, and the dealer swore that hewas Taka's brother, but I suspected that the relationship was nearerthat of great-great-grandson, for Koma, smaller than Taka, of brightergold and more vivid ruby, was the quintessence of vital energy, a veryspark of fire. He fought like a mimic Hector while the dealer wascatching and boxing him, and all the gay-hued parrots jumped up anddown on their perches and screamed with the fun of having somethinggoing on.The dealer declared that the two birds would thrive best in the samecage; so I introduced Koma into Taka's commodious abode that afternoonand listened in high content to their jubilant bursts of song. Theywent to sleep on the highest perch with their tiny bodies cuddled closetogether, but during the following week their love lyric was punctuatedby several fights. Taka, hitherto so contemptuous of the comforts ofhis cage, now wanted to swing whenever he saw Koma swinging andinsisted on shoving his guest away and eating from the very seed-cupthat Koma had selected, whereupon Koma, a glistening ruffle of wrath,would fling himself in furious attack upon his honorable ancestor.Mary, whose partiality for Koma, little beauty that he was, attemptedno disguise, maintained that Taka always began the combats and wasalways worsted; but I was not so sure. Koma, a restless gleam of chirpand song, was such a violent character that twice he rammed his headbetween the upper wires of his cage and nearly hanged himself. Someheathen deity had given him, for his protection, a tremendous voice,and his shrieks soon brought me running to his rescue. Both times, assoon as I had parted the wire and released the lustrous little head,Taka, wildly agitated through the minutes of Koma's peril, turnedfiercely upon me and accused me of the trap."_You_ did it! Ugly thing! _You_ did it! You nearly killed my Koma."And poor little Koma, gasping in the gravel, would chime in faintly butwith no less resentment, "_She_ did it."Yet within an hour they might be fighting again, and I would find themspent and panting, glaring at one another from opposite sides of theirlimited arena, with deep cuts about the little warrior faces."Taka," I would remonstrate, "aren't you ashamed to treat your ownclansman like this, when you wanted him so much?"But Taka and penitence were far asunder. "It's my lasttail-feather--chir-r-r! Koma, he hasn't any tail at all--chir-r-r! Nomore have I now. Don't care a grub. I pulled _his_ out. Catch me thatfly, can't you? Who-oo-oo-oop!"Koma, whose song had an entrancing gypsy note, was so much the wilderof the two that Taka seemed comparatively tame. Koma's terror of humanmonsters was unconquerable, and his panics, whenever one of us nearedthe cage, soon destroyed the frail confidence that our long patiencehad been building up in Taka. Presently we had two out-and-out rebelson our hands, and even Dame Gentle, who "had a way" with birds, couldnot cajole them into a League of Lovers.When the cage door was opened for putting in or taking out the smallglass bathtub, it was a ticklish matter to prevent their escape, forthey could dart like mice through the least crack and, sly atoms ofconspiracy, were always on the lookout for a chance. Warned by bitterexperience, we saw to it that the windows were closed before thatperilous task was undertaken, but too often a victorious squeal fromKoma would announce his exit, and Taka, hopping in sympatheticexultation from perch to perch, would urge him on with ancient Japanesewar-cries while he soared from mantel to chandelier, vanished in thefolds of a portiere or flashed from fern to rubber-plant. If hesucceeded in reaching the entry, he would prolong the game by hiding inovershoes and umbrellas, while Taka, now that Koma was away, would atonce set up his pleading, poignant call and never cease until thetruant, snapping his pink bill and kicking fiercely with scratchylittle claws, was thrust back into the cage. Much as Taka might playthe tyrant, he could not bear having Koma out of his sight and reach.Once, after an especially savage duel in which Koma had been badlytrampled and pecked, we put the wounded hero into a cage of his own andhung it in the adjoining room. Forthwith both those scamplings raisedsuch a prodigious outcry and lament, taking on as if their naughtyspecks of hearts were broken, that we brought back Koma's cage and hungit in the window beside Taka's. But even so they scolded and protestedand, as the shadows fell, established themselves each on the extremeend of a perch, as near one another as they could get, but with thecruel wires and a few inches of space between them. Still they fumedand fretted until we returned Koma, mauled as he was, to Taka's cage,when instantly they nestled their plumy sides close together andblissfully went to sleep.Yet we kept both cages in use, separating our tiny incorrigibles whentheir battles waxed dangerous. They loved to talk them all overafterwards, gabbling like schoolboys, but if one of us chanced toapproach the window--"Sshh! Don't tell the ogre," and in an instantthey were dumb as toy idols. When we had time, we would occasionally,after taking all due precautions, throw wide their cage doors andinvite them to enjoy the freedom of the room; but liberty so given theydespised. Only stolen fruit is sweet. After much deliberation andconsultation, they would stealthily steal out and skurry about thefloor like rats for a while, hunting for bugs and worms. When it becameevident that our rugs did not furnish such refreshment, they wouldcuddle up together in Taka's cage and spoon. Koma would tuck hisshining wee head down on Taka's shoulder, and Taka would gently peckhim all over from the tip of his bill to his claws. Then, more oftenthan not, they would bristle and square for the fun of a fight. At thispoint we would try to catch Koma and put him back into his own safecage, but even when his little coxcomb was so bloody that I had to washit off under the faucet, he was the top of ingratitude, gasping andclattering with fury. All the while Taka, who had cut that poor pateopen, would be trilling abuse. A pugnacious pair of fairy Japanesepirates they were!We kept those midgets, a daily trouble and amusement, through thewinter. They sang like angels when it pleased them and in the intervalsconversed exclusively with each other in a harsh, metallic chatter thatfilled the house. But one sad June morning we found Taka in the bottomof the cage, on his back, the uplifted claws pathetically curled, thewee body stiff and cold.                   "The bird is dead    That we have made so much on."Koma knew what had happened and bewailed his loss in such a shrill,incessant keening that when, a few days later, an east wind gave him aswiftly fatal chill, we could only be glad to have that pitiful pipinghushed.Little aliens! We had never known them.WARBLER WEATHER    The oak-leaves yet are doubting    Between the pink and green;    Half smiling and half pouting    Our shy New England May    Touches each happy spray,    And at her call the runaway    Warbler tribes convene.    The gold-flecked Myrtle flitters,    The Redstart dives and spins,    The gay Magnolia glitters,    The little Rubycrown    Twinkles up and down;    The fairy folk have come to town    With all their violins.    Our garden party sparkles    With varied warbler wear,    The olive suit that darkles    To umber, russet crest,    Blue tippet, crocus vest;    New fashions come with every guest,    Winged jewels of the air.    Their treetop conversation    Is sweetest of the sweet,    With flashes of flirtation    As gallants bow and dip.    "Witch-e-wee!" "Cher!" "Chip-chip!"    Too elfin fine for human lip    Their dainty: "Tzeet! tzeet! tzeet!"    When we shall walk together    In Paradise, Most Dear,    May it be warbler weather,    Divine with flutterings    Of exquisite wee wings,    Our own familiar angelings    That piped God's praises here.SUMMER RESIDENTS AT A WISCONSIN LAKEBY KATHARINE COMAN    "Another beautiful day of sunshine and shimmering leaves and    bird-notes and human love."    --Katharine Coman: _Letter_.The summer resort in question is only one of the numberless lakeletsthat dot the hill country of Wisconsin; a mere dimple in the sunnylandscape, filled with limpid water. The banks are overhung bybeautiful lindens and mammoth oaks and by hoar cedars of a thousandyears' growth.So sloping are the shores that reeds and rushes run far out into thelake, carrying the green life of the earth into the blue heaven of thewater. Creeks and bayous stretch in turn far back into the land, andthe reeds and rushes follow after. Knee-deep in the swamps stand thetamarack trees. Their cool shades cherish the mystery of the primevalforest that held undisputed sway in this region only fifty years ago.Back on the hills lie rich grain fields and comfortable farmhouses,each defined against the sky by its windmill and cluster of barns andhaystacks.This is an ideal summer residence for birds who have a mind fordomestic joys. Nothing, for example, could be better adapted fornesting purposes than these cedar trees; not so much the centuriedveterans, as the young things of ten or twenty years' growth. Theirdense and prickly foliage promises security from invasion, while theclose-set branches offer most attractive building-sites. Here therobins place their substantial structures; a masonry of sticks and mud,hollowed out within into a chamber as round and smooth as if molded ona croquet ball, and lined with fine, soft grasses. The catbirds buildmore loosely, weaving strips of cedar bark into a rough basket. Theinterior is softened for the tender bodies of the anticipated nestlingsby coils of horse hair. The mourning dove lays her eggs on a frailscaffolding of cedar twigs, with the merest suggestion of padding. Howthe eggs are kept in place on windy days is a mystery to theuninitiated. As for brooding the young, the mother bird soon gives overthe attempt to do more than sit alongside her twin fledglings. Thecedar birds, despite their name, are oftenest found in the lindentrees. Rowing along the water side one may see the slender bodiestilting on the top-most branches, flitting to and fro among the pendantyellow bracts, peering shyly this way and that, whispering to eachother sage words of caution as to the queerness of all the world "savethee and me, Dorothy." Gentle little Quakers they seem in the daintiestof dove-color plumage. They are connoisseurs in the matter of foods, aswell as of dress. Nothing pleases their palate so well as the wildcherries that ripen by the roadside. The sweet kernels of the lindenfruit are not bad eating, however, if one may judge by the quantitiesof split shells to be found beneath the trees. The lake is sought outby birds as well as humans for the pleasure of bathing in the cool,fresh water. Sit quietly by some pebbly bank for a half hour or so, andyou cannot fail to see robin or bluejay or turtledove come down to takehis daily plunge.The reedy marshes are beloved by the redwings. The thick-set tufts ofthe cat-o'-nine-tails afford ideal sites for summer cottages, withbuilding material close at hand. Here, too, the marsh wrens weave theiroven-shaped nests and hang them among the banners of the iris. Thewater-lily pools are alive with summer folk. Quaint, unwieldy bitternsflap their slow way to nests well hidden in the reeds. Coots steal inand out _en route_ to their lake dwellings. The broad green pads offerthe Virginia rail a secluded perch, where he may consider which quarterof the shining mud flats will prove the best feeding ground for theday. A trim little figure in gray and tan, he gathers no soil from theblack ooze through which he wades. Another dainty person who hauntsthese same shallows is the spotted sandpiper, the much loved"teeter-tail." He runs tipping along the water's edge, with anoccasional short flight, as much at home among these placid ripples asby the booming sea. The kill-deer plover vibrates between the grassymeadow and the beach, but he, as well as the sandpiper, prefers tostake his domestic happiness on dry ground. Among the birds of theshore, the kingfisher is most in evidence. Conspicuous in blue coat,gray waistcoat and broad, white collar, he flies along the beachseeking for the dead branches of oak or cedar that shall serve him as alookout station from which to spy upon the finny folk swimming in thewater beneath. A flash in the air, a splash in the water, and the"expert angler" dashes triumphantly home, his watchman's rattleannouncing victory and fresh supplies to the awkward squad of babykingfishers deep in the clay bank awaiting his arrival.Back in the meadows where thistles and wild lettuce are going to seed,the hard-bills spend their holidays. Goldfinches cling to the thistletops, merry little clowns in yellow and black, antic tumblers no lessagile and versatile than the chickadee. Dickcissels search the purpleironweeds for provender, and song sparrows flit along the blossomingfence rows. Kingbirds perch at a point of vantage and watch theirchance for a dash at a grasshopper. Fine fighters these fellows, fullyequal to defending their well-feathered nests against all comers, andtherefore disdaining concealment. Bluebirds carol high in the air theirsong of peace on earth and goodwill to man. Humming birds hover overthe milkweeds, bent on extracting not honey only, but toothsome insectsfrom the rosy blooms.The tall oaks are sought out by the orioles, tanagers and grosbeaks,--abrilliant and tuneful company. Here, too, the vireos, warbling,red-eyed, white-eyed and yellow-throated, spy out invisible insectsunder the growing leaves. Warblers throng the woods in May and June,reveling in the bursting buds; but most of them have pushed on toCanada for the summer season. Only the black and white creeper remainsto nest in Wisconsin. The resounding tattoo of the high-hole rings fromthe hole of a blasted tree. The wood looks as if riddled with bullets.The red-headed woodpecker follows close on his yellow-winged cousin.Both find an abundant supply of ants in the decaying forest. High in afork of the branches the red-tailed hawk pitches his tent, a ragged,black wigwam, rivaling that of the crow for size and inaccessibility.The haunts of men are not wholly eschewed by our little brothers of theair. The peewee loves to place his nest under the eaves of a shelteringporch, and the phoebe is no less sociable. The presence of humanbeings does not at all disconcert their housekeeping arrangements. Ihave seen a young brood fed and fondled, and finally piloted forth fortheir first journey in the world, within ten feet of a hammock full ofchildren.To see the water birds at home one should take a boat in the earlymorning or toward nightfall, and float silently on the open bosom ofthe lake. Then you may watch the black terns wheeling and turning inthe blue sky, like beautiful great swallows. They are easilydistinguished even at a considerable height by their white wing bars. Aloon paddles slowly across the bay with tantalizing unconcern. It is ofno use to follow him, however, even with muffled oars. He knows a trickworth any two of yours. Huge fellow as he is, he dives beneath thesurface, leaving not a ripple behind him. After five minutes of puzzledwaiting you may see him--or is it his double?--pop up from the watermany rods away, as serene and still as if he had not just executed asubmarine maneuver hardly to be excelled by the latest torpedo boat.Quite as expert a performer is the pied-billed grebe, who swims longdistances with body submerged and only the tip of the bill out of thewater. Unobserving gunners conclude that he has gone to the bottom ofthe lake, and call him the hell-diver. The grebe spends half of hislife in or on the water. His nest is a raft buoyed upon a clump ofdecaying vegetation, and looks like a floating island moored to a reed.Birds of the lake, too, seem the swallows--tree swallows, rough-wingedand barn swallows. They skim the water hither and yon in mad pursuit ofprey. No degree of familiarity with their mud nests avails to deprivethese winged atoms of their halo of spring and romance.Birds of high degree occasionally visit our humble lakelet. A baldeagle has been seen on the lightning-scarred branch of its tallest oak.Blue herons flap their majestic way from shore to shore. If you wereborn with a silver spoon in your mouth you may even be so lucky as tosee a snowy heron passing through to some heronry in the wilds ofCanada. The night herons come every spring to their ancient rookery ina swamp hard by. As the shadows fall the birds may be heard calling,"squawk, squawk," while they make their way down the creek to theirfishing grounds in the lake.For the better part of our bird neighbors the summer sojourn is no_dolce far niente_. They come north that their babies may havewholesome air and suitable food. A gay young husband, like theruby-throated humming bird, shirks domestic responsibilities, but heexpects only two wee nestlings. A brood of five or six requires theassiduous attention of both parents. Baby blue jays, for example, seemto have an unlimited appetite. Their scolding, snarling cries beginwith the early dawn and only cease with nightfall. Even after therascals are flown one may find an anxious mother vainly striving tosatisfy her clamoring darlings, as she hurries from one to another withsome choice tidbit. A great hulking fellow, as big as his parents andas gayly feathered, will stand crying like an infant, with wingsa-tremble and mouth a-gape, waiting for the food to be thrust down histhroat. Young robins are hardly less rapacious but far more tractable.I was one day watching the d?but of a family that lived in aneighboring cedar tree. The mother bird was having an anxious time, foreach young one, as he spread his wings, made but a flap or two and fellsprawling into the network of branches beneath the nest. One younghopeful essayed a more ambitious flight and came down to the ground. Hehad no thought of fear and, being of an inquiring turn of mind, camehopping through the grass to see what I was like. Such a dear littleman, in polka dot pinafore and white ruffles! But "chuck, chuck,"mother robin called a warning note, and like a flash he turned tail andbolted into the bushes. I found him later perched on a branch withineasy grasp of my hand. He gazed at me for some minutes with eyes fullof baby wonder; then, remembering the maternal admonitions, he fled toa higher branch. Of all feathered mothers the catbird is the noisiest.She flits restlessly about, eying from every point of vantage theintruder who dares to show an interest in her housekeeping. Idetermined to sit it out one morning, pitting my patience against hersympathy for the hungry young ones. After two hours of flutter and meowthe mother heart could no longer resist the appeal of the gaping yellowmouths. With sudden resolution she dashed straight to Farmer Black'sgooseberry patch, seized a berry and returned in a flash. The lusciousmorsel once divided among the small fry, however, she flew back to herpost of observation.The turtledoves seem a sentimental lot. During the courting season anenamored swain will sit for hours in silent contemplation of his owngraceful pose, or chanting softly, "I am alone--alone--alone." The nestonce built and the young ones hatched, he hovers about in tenderconstancy, bringing food to the mother as well as to the babies, andperching alongside of the nest as close as circumstances will allow.The little people are carefully tended until they are well-nigh grown,though they look most uninteresting objects. A young dove will sitsilent and motionless for hours at a stretch, the only sign of life theglitter in his bright, bead-like eyes. Decide that he has gone daft,however, and venture a step too near,--presto! With flutter and whirrhe takes to wings, and is off as if flying was as simple a feat as thetraditional "falling off a log." The jaunty kingfisher, too, makes adevoted parent. One day we saw a fledgling fly straight out over thelake. The mother bird followed close, uttering cries of alarm. But,alas! she could not lend him wings. His young muscles were unequal tohis ambition, and the little body dropped into the water. Both parentsdashed madly back and forth over the still, shining surface, and thenwandered disconsolately from tree to tree along the shore, voicingtheir grief in wild, rattling cries.Bird families hold together long after the nest is abandoned. They maybe seen toward nightfall making their way by twos and threes to thetamarack swamp across the lake. The close-set, symmetrical branchesprovide the best of perches for inexperienced feet. "Birds of a featherflock together" when it comes to a question of lodging houses. Oneevening I counted one hundred and fifteen kingbirds roosting in thetapering spires of the tamarack trees.September days are heralded by the return of the birds who havesummered in Canada. Fox sparrows stop with us a week or so on theirsouthward journey. The evening grosbeaks have come down from farSaskatchewan, and are thinking of spending the winter here. Wild geesewake one o' nights, with their hoarse "honk, honk." They have stoppedfor a taste of our tender frogs, but will soon re-form their triangularcaravans and push on to the South. Ducks, mallards and canvasbacks,feed and fatten in the shallow water among the reeds. The gunnersarrive as soon as they, however, and will soon frighten them away.Everybody is getting ready for the great migration. Troops of youngbirds flutter through the trees, like autumn leaves blown by a gust ofwind. They are taking their first lessons in migration and in foodsupply.The natives look on at these preparations with cynical unconcern. Bluejays chatter and scream with a daily extension of their marvelousvocabulary. Crows come proudly out from the deep woods, leading black,ungainly broods, and direct their flight to the ripening cornfields.Nuthatches, the white-bellied and the Canadian, bustle about the treetrunks, bent on making the most of their time while Jack Frost sparesthe insect life. The chickadees, nature's acrobats, turn somersaultsamong the branches in sheer defiance of the law of gravitation. Thecares of summer are over and done with. The woes of winter do notterrify this morsel of india rubber and compressed air. The Englishsparrow pursues his ubiquitous search for food with insular disdain ofeverything he does not understand. He has penetrated our sylvanretreats and secured a foothold here by the most impudent of squatterclaims. He lives and multiplies by dint of a systematic disregard ofeverybody's rights. The manners and the morals of the great city clingto him. He will have nothing in common with our country ways. He bringswith him the blight of civilization.THE JESTER    Myths from earth's childhood tell    Of Godhood visible,--    Indra, the azure-skied,    Four-handed, thousand-eyed;    Far-wandering Isis, chief    Lady of Love and Grief;    Zeus, on each rash revolt    Hurling the thunderbolt;    Woden of warrior form    Gray-mantled with the storm;    Lir of the foam-white hair,    Mad with the sea's despair.    But of those Splendors who    Conceived the kangaroo,    With gesture humorous    Shaped hippopotamus,    Intoned the donkey's bray    And, in an hour of play,    Taught peacocks how to strut?    Holy is Allah, but    Is holiness expressed    In hedgehogs? Whence the jest?    Even in creation's dawn    Was Puck with Oberon?EMILIUS    "O, I could beat my infinite blockhead."    --Jonson's _The Devil is an Ass_.Professor Emily has the kindest heart in the world and is always doinggood. Her charities would make a rosary more fragrant than sandal-buds.And yet, perhaps, one time out of a thousand, her intention and heraction trip each other up.One day in early June she met on our village sidewalk, half a mile fromthe nearest pond or brook, a snapping turtle of formidable proportions,easily weighing his twenty or twenty-five pounds. In characteristicfashion she stopped to consider what she could do for him. Though hewas, for his own part, neither cordial nor communicative, she decidedthat he must have lost his way, since the water, his natural habitat,lay behind him, and by a dexterous application of boot and stick sheturned him about, quite against his will, so that his snout pointedtoward home. But the turtle, a surly, obstinate fellow, with no respectwhatever for academic authority, refused to progress in the appointedpath, and for some five minutes they argued it out together, with nomanifest result except a distinct access of temper, rather evenlydivided.Your true philanthropist is not easily balked, and Professor Emily,returning the scrutiny of those small, keen, sinister eyes that watchedher every movement, skillfully dodged that dark, vicious head whichkept lurching forward from the olive-mottled shell in lightning-swiftmotions, seeking to strike this determined benefactor whom only muddledwits could mistake for an enemy."No, you don't," she answered him sternly, retreating before a suddenforward scramble of the broad webbed feet. Regardless of the terrifiedprotests of a group of freshmen, who had gathered on the outskirts ofthe fray, she executed a rapid rear movement and seized the reptilefirmly toward the end of its long, rough tail. Swinging this furiousCaliban clear of the ground and holding it well out from her body, sheconsidered what to do next.The noon had suddenly turned hot. She found herself panting a little.That turtle was surprisingly heavy. He was awkward to handle, too,twisting his neck back over his shell and darting it out left and rightto a disconcerting distance. Soothing tones had no effect whatever andthere seemed to be no suitable surface to pat. Even if he could andwould have told her the exact location of his native creek, it mightprove an irksome task to carry him so far, with those powerful jawssnapping most suggestively, only biding their time to get in aneffective argument. Our house was close at hand. Why not accomplish twogood deeds in one and give this self-willed waif to us for a pet? Hewould have a happy home and we another of God's creatures to love.Dear Emily!A shriek from Mary brought us to the kitchen. There was our householdstaff and stay mounted on a chair, clasping her skirts tight about herand apparently addressing the ceiling. There was our generous-heartedfriend, flushed and weary, but, by a miracle, unbitten. There was ourneighbor, Young Audubon, a budding naturalist, who had come to her aid_en route_ and shared the honors of the delivery. And there was anindignant snapping turtle, lying on its back in the middle of thekitchen floor. Notwithstanding the pale yellows of its under-side,shell and legs and tail, its expression was profane.Joy-of-Life told Mary to be quiet. I poured the philanthropist a glassof water. Then, exchanging eloquent glances, we learned of the newpleasure in store for us."They make very nice pets," declared the donor, beaming withbenevolence. "Large specimens live for hundreds of years. They are notat all exacting about their food and can be trained to eat from thehand.""Not from mine," screamed Mary, bouncing up and down on her chair."Wasn't it Pierre Loti who had a pet tortoise?" continued Emily. "Itsname was Suleima and it used to play with his white kitten. You mightname the turtle Suleima, after its literary cousin.""No. We'll name it Emilius, after you, if it must be named at all.""But we haven't even a black kitten," protested Joy-of-Life, "and solittle time for playing ourselves, that I am really afraid----""The dear might be dull. Wouldn't you better take him back to where youfound him?""And leave him on the road? Lost? For motors to run over? How could heget out of their way? What does he know about motors?"We admitted that he did not look modern."Besides, I must run to catch that next train. I've just rememberedthat I am due at the Melting Pot conference in town.""Isn't there room for Emilius in the pot?" I called after her, but shewas gone without waiting to be thanked."If ye'll put the baste in a suitcase," proposed Mary, "it's mesilfwill take it over to her rooms an' lave it there."But Young Audubon, who had been lying on the floor, examining Emiliusfrom the tip of his tail to the snub of his snout, was enraptured,--soenraptured that the chelonian, as he called it, was pressed upon him asa free gift, regretfully declined because of certain prejudices on thepart of a devoted but unscientific mother."I can study him almost as well over here," cheerily said YoungAudubon. "Now the first thing to do is to drill a hole in hiscarapace.""Carry what?""Upper shell, you know."The boy, a blond, blushed pink at our ignorance and managed, in anoffhand way, to touch the lower shell when he lightly referred to it asthe plastron."The drilling won't hurt him. He won't even know it's happening."Whatever the darkened spirit, inaccessible in its armor, thought of thesubsequent proceedings, it registered no objection. Defenseless in hisundignified position, Emilius suffered our well-meant attentions inbitter silence. The hole was drilled, the turtle tipped over, graspedagain by his peculiarly unattractive tail and borne triumphantly to thegrassy bank behind the house, where, like any domestic animal, he wastethered to a tree."What next?" asked Joy-of-Life, who was already losing her heart to theunresponsive monster."Water," pronounced Sir Oracle. "Turtles won't feed except under water.They can't swallow if their heads aren't completely immersed. It willtake your largest dishpan----""It's mesilf that is going home to-morrow--to stay," announced Mary."Wouldn't a washtub do?" compromised Joy-of-Life. "There's that oldone, you know, Mary, that you never use.""First-rate. Show me where to find it, Mary. I'll give you a start tothat wild cherry."With a craft beyond the semblance of his open countenance, YoungAudubon raced Mary to the cellar, where she arrived panting too hardfor protests. They soon returned in amicable companionship, carrying abattered blue tub between them.Jerking up Emilius by the cord, we plumped him into the tub, poured inabundant water and left him to be happy. Then our troubles began.In the first place, Emilius absolutely refused to eat, in water or out.Understanding from our one authority that he needed a carnivorous diet,we tempted him, day after day, with every variety of meat brought toour door in the butcher's white-hooded cart with its retinue of hungrydogs, but nothing whatever would our boarder touch. And in the secondplace, he was, unlike Diogenes, forever scrambling out of his tub anddigging himself in at one point or another on the bank. Several times aday one or the other of us might be seen tugging up Emilius by his cordfrom the bowels of the earth and solicitously dumping him down againinto his tub of water, which a shovelful of mud, shreds of meat andother attractions still failed to render homelike. His one object inlife was to get out of it."If Emilius would only take a nap!" I sighed one warm afternoon, when Ihad just rescued him from a deep pit of his frenzied digging for thethird time that day."Read him poetry," advised Joy-of-Life. Magical snatches of BlissCarman's deep-sea songs ran through my head:--    "When sheering down to the Line    Come polar tides from the North,    Thy silver folk of the brine    Must glimmer and forth;"       *    *    *    *    *    "The myriad fins are moving,    The marvelous flanges play."Chesterton, who chuckled over another grotesque denizen of the deep,would have felt the charm of Emilius:    "Dark the sea was, but I saw him,      One great head with goggle eyes,    Like a diabolic cherub      Flying in those fallen skies.       *    *    *    *    *    "For I saw that finny goblin      Hidden in the abyss untrod;    And I knew there can be laughter      On the secret face of God."But it was almost too early for Chesterton, and quite too early for thefascinating fish poems of Rupert Brooke or for Chauncey Hickox'sfeeling apostrophe to a tortoise:    "Paludal, glum, with misdirected legs,    You hide your history as you do your eggs,    And offer us an osseous nut to crack    Much harder than the shell upon your back.    No evolutionist has ever guessed    Why your cold shoulder is within your chest--    Why you were discontented with a plan    The vertebrates accept, from fish to man.    For what environment did you provide    By pushing your internal frame outside?    How came your ribs in this abnormal place?    Inside your rubber neck you hide your face    And answer not."Besides, I had no ground for hope that Emilius would be pleased by myreading of poetry or by anything else that I could do for him. Heimpressed me as intensely preoccupied, a turtle of a fixed idea.I was standing by the tub at sunset, trying to ingratiate myself withits sulky occupant, whom I had just dragged up from his latest hole inthe bank, by tickling his flippers with a playful twig, when GiantBluff strode over from his adjacent territory and made us a party ofthree."How's your snapper?""I don't know. He doesn't tell. But I'm afraid he can't be feeling veryfit, for he hasn't eaten anything since he came, a week ago.""Hasn't, though? Huh! Looked out of my window at three o'clock lastnight and saw it grazing out there at the length of its rope, munchinggrass like any old cow."Previous conversations with Giant Bluff had impaired our faith in hisstrict veracity."I thought turtles ate only animal food.""If it's fresh and kicking. What you ought to do is to catch it a messof frogs. 'Twould tear a live frog to pieces fast enough. But you'vestarved it to grass. That's all right. I raised turtles out on theMojave desert one spell and fed 'em on nothing but grass. Quite adainty out there. Sold 'em for five dollars apiece. Turned over a coolthousand----""Of turtles?""Of dollars. Easy's winking. This snapper of yours wouldn't be badeating. Might fetch five cents a pound in the market."I was not exactly fond of Emilius, but I hated to hear him discussed asedible pounds. Moving away a little, I began to stir lightly with mytwig the loose earth in his last excavation. Giant Bluff was nofavorite in our neighborhood, into which he had intruded, a strangerfrom the wild west, a year or two before. His little habit of sittingon his back steps, Sunday afternoons, with a rifle across his knees,and shooting with accurate aim every cat and hen that trespassed on hisland was in itself enough to account for his unpopularity.The shooting, however, except when a pet rooster or tabby was thevictim, thrilled the children on the hill with a delicious terror. Onlythat morning I had seen Towhead, crouched behind a clump of syringas,playing sharp-shooter."Here!" he was shouting to Rosycheeks, who was approaching very slowly,like a fascinated bird. "Hurry up! You've got to come walking by and beshot.""I doesn't want to," sobbed poor little Rosycheeks, "but I'stomin',--I's tomin'."The glory of Giant Bluff, whose boasts were as prodigious as hisprofession was mysterious, had recently, however, been tarnished by anopen discomfiture. One of our oldest and most respected citizens, aYankee in blood and bone, driver of a depot carriage, had incurredGiant Bluff's deadly displeasure. And this was the way of it. In thisbeginning of our sleepy summertide, when the campus was as empty oflife as a seigniorial park, when the citizens were able to use thesidewalks and the shopkeepers dozed behind their counters, the New Yorktrain dropped at our station a sharp-voiced young woman in a flamboyanthat.Uncle Abram, the only driver to persist in meeting trains through thelong vacation, watched from his carriage, with indifferent eyes, herbrisk approach."Is this a public vehicle?""Think likely.""Do you know where Mr. Benjamin Bluff lives?""Maybe.""Take me there."On the way the fare, Giant Bluff's daughter by a former marriage,questioned Uncle Abram as to her father's business and position in thetown, but she might as well have tried to wring information fromEmilius. Arrived at the house, she bade her driver inquire for her ifMr. Bluff was at home, saying that otherwise she would not call.Mrs. Bluff, whom Uncle Abram had never met before, answered the bell."Mr. Bluff in?""No. Why?""Nothin' partic'lar," and Uncle Abram backed himself away."Well?" queried his passenger, as he started up Daniel Webster with aprofessional crack of the whip."Ain't to hum.""Who came to the door?""Lady.""What lady?""Dunno.""Was it his wife?""Dunno as 'twas his wife."His exasperated fare, afterwards tracking down her parent in Boston,made use of this incident for the slander of her stepmother."A nice impression she makes, to be sure! Even that numskull of adriver doubted whether she was your wife or not."Giant Bluff came back that evening breathing out threats of slaughter.Before midnight it was noised all about our village that he had swornto shoot Uncle Abram on sight. The old driver was warned by a group ofexcited boys who found him serenely smoking over a game of checkers andwere quite unable to interest him in their tidings. But the next day,when the station platform was well filled with our business men waitingfor the eight o'clock into town, Uncle Abram drove up to the depot andreined in Daniel Webster just against the spot where Giant Bluff wasstanding, a little aloof for the reason that nobody cared to stand withhim.Taken by surprise as Uncle Abram coolly looked him over, Giant Bluff,unexpectedly to himself, said:"Good morning.""Ez good a mornin' ez God ever made."Giant Bluff, who prided himself on his atheism, began to swagger."That's stuff and nonsense. Only babies and fools believe such rubbishnowadays.""Thet so? Ain't no God, eh, and he never made no mornin's? Wal! Maybeye'll put me in the way of findin' out about quite a few little thingslike that. I've hearn tell thet ye're goin' to shoot me, an' myrheumatiz is so bad this summer thet I'd be obleeged if ye'd shoot meright now an' hev it over.""You--you insulted my wife," gasped Giant Bluff."Not a nary," protested Uncle Abram, with a touch of indignant color inhis weather-beaten cheeks. "I said I didn't know whether the lady thetcome to the door was your wife or not, an' no more I didn't. I hedn'tnever seen her afore. But even s'posin' thet your morals didn't hurtyou none, do ye think I'd let it out to a stranger? No, siree; I'd akep my mouth shet, for the credit o' the town. An' now thet I've had mysay on thet little misunderstandin', ye kin shoot me ez soon ez yelike."The crowded platform roared for joy, the opportune train came in, andGiant Bluff, the first to swing aboard, was not seen in the villageagain for a fortnight. So it came to pass that he was but newlyacquainted with Emilius.As I was aimlessly poking about with my twig in the last of thosemysterious holes which Emilius had been so desperately resolved ondigging, a number of small, round, white objects came to view."Why, what are those?" was my imbecile exclamation, stooping to seethem better in the half light. Forthwith Giant Bluff was stooping at myshoulder."_Eggs._ Didn't you ever see turtles' eggs before? It beats me what youlearned ladies don't know."I went abruptly in to Joy-of-Life, and there we sat in the dusk,overwhelmed with contrition. Poor, dear, misunderstood, ill-treatedEmilius! All he wanted was a chance to get away from the water and layher eggs in some warm, deep chamber, where he could lie hidden fordays, and they for weeks, in comfort and security. And how we hadworried her with our continual upjerkings and immersions, how we hadkept him digging one forbidden nursery after another, how arrogantly wehad set ourselves against the unpersuadable urge of instinct!Before breakfast the next morning we hurried out together to setEmilius free. There was no Emilius. The tub stood empty, from the treedangled a bit of cut cord, the loose earth that marked the holes hadbeen neatly raked over, there were no small, white, round objects to befound. Had Emilius gone for good and taken his eggs with her?As we searched the ground in vain, Giant Bluff sauntered out of hisback door, smiling an inscrutable smile."Saw that snapper of yours walking off an hour since. It went under theback fence out into the woods. Reckon you can't catch it, though it wastraveling rather slow; couldn't hurry much, for it had a dozen littleturtles trotting along on each side. Quite a handsome family!"Joy-of-Life and I, turning our backs on that stupendous liar, stared ateach other with horror dawning in our eyes.Had he----? Would he----? Could he----?_Emilius!_HUDSON'S CAT    "This night our cat ranne crying from one side of the ship to the    other, looking overboord, which made us to wonder; but we saw    nothing."    --_Juet's Journal._    What did you see, O pussy-cat-mew,    Pet of the _Half-Moon's_ turbulent crew?    Who taught them mew-tiny? Wasn't it you?    Juet kept journal of storm and fog    And the mermaid that set them all agog,    But what has become of the cat-a-log?    Henry Hudson, the master sage,    Writ large his name on history's page,    But you, you too, were a purr-sonage.    Shall the tale slight you, whose tail was a-quiver    As you and Hudson sailed up the river    Made only his by Time the giver?    Why did you take to adventuring,    Puss-illanimous fireside thing?    What was the cargo you hoped to bring?    Did you dream of multitudinous mice    Running about the Isles of Spice    In a paradoxical Paradise?    Were you not homesick where monsters swam,    Dolorous dolphin and clamorous clam,    For your sunny stoop in Amsterdam?    Months at sea, while the billows roared,    And the Milky Way not a cupful poured;    No wonder Tabby looked over-bored.    You had your feelin's, as felines go,    Poor little puss. What scared you so?    O stupid sailors that didn't know!    Was it a dogfish struck the spark    From your sea-green eyes with the quaint remark    That you were sailing upon a bark?    Millions of happy pussies fall    Into oblivion; still you call    From the top of your ancient cater-wall,    Call on the centuries to concur    In praise of Tabby the Mariner,    Who discovered the Catskills, named for her.CATASTROPHES    "And when Maeldune and his men went into the best of the houses    they saw no one in it but a little cat that was in the middle of    the house, and it playing about on the four stone pillars that were    there, and leaping from one to another. It looked at the men for a    short space, but it did not stop from its play."    --Lady Gregory's _Book of Saints and Wonders_.People are people, and cats are cats. We do not know our pussies. Wepet them but we cannot tame them. Landor's Cincirollo,        "wagging his dread jaw at every chirp    Of bird above him on the olive branch,"is latent in Wordsworth's                           "kitten on the wall    Sporting with the leaves that fall."These charming fireside tenants of ours have their own concerns, whichlie aloof from the human. Even nursery-lore bears witness to this:    "'Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat,      Where have you been?'    'I've been to London,      To see the Queen.'    'Pussy-cat, Pussy-cat,      What did you there?'    'I frightened a little mouse      Under her chair.'"But if we cannot forego the consciousness of those tiger claws hid inthe velvet daintiness of the light feet, neither can tabby put hertrust in us. Race memory and, too often, individual experience accuseus. Her reticence with humankind, her stealth, her self-reliance, mightwell have been stamped deep into cat character by the monstrouscruelties she has suffered at our hands. Her reputed connection withwitches, of whom it is estimated that Christendom put to death somenine million, involved the poor animal in their hideous tortures.Indeed, she caught it from all sides. Cats were flung into the bonfiresto perish with the helpless old crones who had cared for them. A witchmight be exorcised by whipping a cat, like the wretched puss long andsolemnly flogged by twelve priests "in a parlor at Denham, til sheevanished out of theyr sight." And it was a cat, so confession on therack declared, that after an accursed christening was cast into the seato raise a storm that should drown James of Scotland, "the devil'sworst enemy," on his wedding journey home from Denmark. This royalwitch-hunter, who came thirteen years later to the throne of England,was not content until thirty human victims had paid by horrible deathsfor the black art of that storm.A few of these maligned cats have left a distinctive record on theblurred page of history. Rutterkin, the familiar of Agnes Flower, whosevery name should have attested her innocence, was black as the soot ofhell, but Mother Fraunces, who learned the secrets of sorcery from herown grandmother, had "a whyte spotted cat * * * to be her sathan,"while the leader of the infernal chorus in the cavern scene of_Macbeth_ was a tabby:    "Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed."Into other inoffensive little beasts, "hedgepigs," puppies, owls, bats,crows, rabbits, toads, the evil spirits were believed to enter, thoughThomas Heywood notes with satisfaction that no imp was ever sosacrilegious as to masquerade as dove or lamb; but the cat calumny haslasted longest.                    "And shall I be afrayd    Of Cats in mine own Countrey?"Some of us are, for a recent criminal trial in one of the Middle Statesbrought out the fact that many an American pocket, even to-day, carriesa silver bullet as a talisman against the "black hex," or witch-cat.Yet from the cruelties of superstition poor puss has suffered less thanfrom the cruelties of sport. Rustic festivals in Merry England were notcomplete without the archery matches whose target was a terrified,bleeding cat, hung up in a wicker "bottle," while shouts of gleegreeted the successful hits in the whizzing storm of arrows. As aspecial merry-making, a great company of our jovial ancestors would setforth on horseback, with drum-beating and all manner of hullabaloo,attended by half the population of the town, to enjoy themselves at theexpense of some ill-fated pussy. A barrel, half full of soot, was swungfrom a cross-beam firmly fixed on two high poles. Into this barrel shewas plunged and under it the valiant horsemen rode as gayly as theEnglish ride to a fox-hunt even yet, striking it tremendous blows withclubs and wooden hammers. If any life was left in the bruised andmangled cat, after the destruction of the barrel, the man who put anend to her by some spectacular novelty of barbarity was the hero of theday.How can we expect wise old Grimalkin to forgive us our atrocities? Sheremembers. Accepting or rejecting at her pleasure what courtesies areoffered her, she maintains her own reserves. Rare are the recordedinstances of her going out of her way to serve mankind, to whom sheowes no debt of gratitude. Yet a legend, attested by two portraits ofthis Good Samaritan, tells that when Sir Henry Wyatt, father of thepoet, was imprisoned in the Tower under Richard III and left to perishof starvation, a cat came daily to his window-grating, bringing him apigeon from a neighboring dove-cot, which doubtless had its own opinionof her charity. No wonder that Sir Henry, in his later, honored yearsunder the Tudors, "would ever make much of cats, as other men will oftheir spaniels or hounds."With the best will in the world toward _felis domestica_, I have neverbeen able to maintain fortunate relations with the individuals thathave come my way. Colleagues of mine have reared kittens that havebecome the pride and joy of their hearths, as yellow Leo, who passedfrom the happiest of homes into a lyric shrine; but my own cats make asorry parade down the avenue of memory. At the far, dim end of theavenue glints out a chubby child in a calico-caped sunbonnet,laboriously trundling in her doll-carriage five blind kittens, with thebenevolent intent of giving them a pleasant airing. The littlecopper-toed shoes bump on the rocks and are caught in the brambles ofthat rough pasture, while at every jolt that sprawl of kittenhoodoverflowing the small red chariot miauls so dolorously that theirbenefactor is sorely tempted to sit down and cry with them. Butamazement at their lack of appreciation is less than resentment at theconduct of their grim, gray mother, Old Spotnose, who comes tearingafter in fierce pursuit and overtakes the rocking vehicle, whence shesnatches one of the wailing passengers by the scruff of its neck andraces back with her dangling burden to the woodshed. Determined to makethe remaining kittens happy, the child goes tugging and panting on, butstill there is heard that dreaded rush in the rear, and another,another, another and yet another of those squallerkins is kidnapped.Nothing is left at last but an empty doll-carriage, overturned amongthe daisies and, deep within the sunbonnet, a puckered, crimson faceflowing with tears.Throughout my childhood Old Spotnose continued to be an unsocial andungracious being. Perhaps annoyed by our persistent attentions to herfrequent families in the woodshed, she sought out all manner ofhiding-places from haymow to cellar. Memorable is the Sunday morningwhen our mother lifted down the hatbox from her upper closet shelf andlooked in, her Sabbath expression completely destroyed, to find ahuddle of new kittens reposing in the crown of her best bonnet. Thesudden disappearances of these successive kitten groups were to myslowly dawning apprehension first a mystery and then a horror. OldSpotnose finally took to the woods, returning to the kitchen door forfood, a gaunt, half-savage creature, only under stress of iceboundweather. When we moved away from the village, she could not be found,but one of my brothers, back for a visit the following summer, heardthat she had been seen skulking about the house and that kindlyneighbors had thrown meat and fish in her way. Carrying a basin ofmilk, he went to a break in the barn foundations and, lying flat on theground, called and coaxed. Relenting toward humankind at the last, sickOld Spotnose, hardly more than skin and bone, crawled out to him. Shewould not taste the milk, but she lay against his knee for a while,accepting his caresses; then dragged herself back under the barn to diealone.From that time to this, all my personal relations with cats have endedin grief. One engaging kitten after another grew into romantic oradventurous youth only to meet disaster. Perhaps our most heart-rendingexperience was with Triptolemus, taken from his mother in such tenderinfancy that we could not teach him to lap milk or even suck it fromthe finger. Finally he solved the problem himself by tumbling into thesaucer and, when he was lifted out, licking his feet with relish. Fordays he insisted on the saucer promenade, taking nourishment only byapplying his wayward little tongue to each foot in turn. From aroly-poly innocent, wondering at the world out of the roundest of blueeyes, he grew, with the astonishing speed of kittenhood, into aprofligate young ruffian, limping home from one disreputable fightafter another with torn ears and gashed neck and thighs. One wounddeepened into a festering, offensive sore, beyond the cure of ourdomestic surgery, and as veterinaries and animal hospitals were thenforeign to our experience, a brother, in my absence, was bidden takethe cat down to the river and drown him. Very slowly the executioner, astout bag in his hand, made his way to the water's edge, Trip careeringabout his feet and playing with the fatal string. The bag was weightedwith stones and the cat was ordered to enter the open mouth. Tripsniffed at it suspiciously, did not like the game, but looked uptrustfully into the familiar face and obeyed. The boy who flung thatbag out into the current and came running home as if nine reproachfullittle ghosts were at his heels could never be brought to drown a catagain.Later on, there was a graceful mite, Argon, whom I can still seejumping after moths in the moonlight; but before the moth-season wasover, there came a night whose darkness never rendered him up. Strayedor stolen, killed, chased, enchanted, it was not for us to know.Years after, our home rejoiced for a few brief weeks in the charms ofFrisky Fuzzy, a peculiarly affectionate, confiding kitty, who met acruel death by the teeth of the rector's terrier. This young priest wasa holy man in general, but he had no regard for the sixth commandmentas broken by his dog. All the neighborhood was aroused, for one belovedpuss after another had been left torn and bleeding by that hypocriticallittle brute, who always kept an eye out for fresh victims as hetrotted sedately at his master's heels, making pastoral calls. When atlast vengeance found him out and the dog lay poisoned on the parsonagesteps, the rector's grief was so sincere that my anger melted insympathy. There had been a coolness between us since Frisky Fuzzy'sfate, but on the next occasion when we met at a neutral tea-table, Iattempted a reconciliation."Perhaps your dog and my cat have made up our quarrel in heaven," Ibegan, passing him the sugar."I don't believe your cat went to heaven," he retorted, passing me thelemon.Our last attempt at a home kitten was with a little sprite of soperverse and irreverent a temper that the most liberal theology couldhardly hold out to us the hope of finding her again in any Paradisewhere pious pussies congregate. This impish being was foisted upon usby an old friend whose persuasive powers, as I had long known, wereirresistible. In tones that were dulcet even by way of the telephoneshe invited me to shelter her wild young puss, Polly, during thesummer, while she closed her own house and, bearing Billy in a basket,sought the repose of an ocean isle."Why don't you carry Polly with you, too?""There isn't room in the basket and, besides, I'm sure that _two_ catswould be against the rules of the railroad.""But Polly takes to the trees whenever I try to pat her. She would runaway.""Oh, I can arrange that for you very nicely. I'll let you have a kittenof hers and then she'll be perfectly contented.""A kitten of Polly's! She is only a kitten herself.""Yes, you are quite right, as usual. One kitten might not be enough tosteady her. It would be better for you to have two, and then Polly willbe kept busy in teaching them to play together.""Now how many catkins have you over there? Own up.""Well! Not counting the pincushion pussy that the mice like to nibble,we have six on hand just now,--Billy and Polly and the four kits. Suchdarlings! Everybody wants them. The competition is really terrible, butof course I insist that you shall have first choice. Come over thisafternoon, please. We are taking the early train to-morrow morning."Spellbound by the cheerful audacity of these proposals, I went, andwhen, after much active exertion on our part, Polly had been caught andsecurely hasped down under a heaving basket-lid, I dubiously selectedtwo of her blind babes to bear her company."Who takes the other two?""You do," responded my friend more winsomely than ever, "unless youwant to be a horrid Herod and go down in history as another slayer ofthe innocents. Look at those little dears! Listen to them! Have you theheart to ask me to drop them into a pail of cold, cold water? What sortof a physiologist are you to suppose that kittens, born only yesterday,could live without their mother? And Polly would miss them dreadfully.I never saw a more devoted family. As soon as they are old enough togambol, they will be such a pleasure for you all,--especially yoursister. And you can easily find nice homes for them, if you want togive them away later on."The four members of our summer household each had the privilege ofnaming one of the kittens. Housewife Honeyvoice called the black oneTopsy; the small schoolgirl, Esther, dubbed the prettiest Daisy; I gaveto the homeliest the encouraging appellation of Cinderella, and SisterJane, returning from a visit to find the feline family in possession,promptly branded the fourth as Beelzebub. Out of deference to heroutraged feelings, a nursery was prepared down cellar, where Polly, forso inexperienced a parent, took excellent care of her babies exceptwhen my officious ignorance interfered.Still a blunderer, I put the kittens out on the south piazza the secondday to treat them to a bracing interlude of air and sunshine. Polly atonce went frantic, mewing and scratching for re-admittance. Presently asuccession of queer, soft thumps brought me to the scene, and there wasPolly, Beelzebub flapping from her mouth, climbing madly up the outsideof the screen door. As soon as she saw me, she parted her jaws to emitanother of those shrill meows that had been profaning the peace of thehouse and down fell poor Belze with a piteous whack on the piazzafloor.Close scrutiny of the situation revealed a big, saffron-colored cat,with a dangerous glint in his green eyes, peering from the shrubberyand, self-rebuked, I restored Polly and her jewels to the safeseclusion of the cellar.But I still held to my faith in the open air and, as soon as thekittens began to blink, Housewife Honeyvoice and I pulled out from thelumber that chokes up cellars under feminine charge the big wire boxwhich had been the Castle Joyous of Robin Hood. Planted firmly on thegrassplot outside the cellar door, with a cat-hole just large enoughfor Polly cut in the wire, it was so secure as to appease even hermaternal fears. Every morning she marshaled her little troop out tothis new abode, carefully drove them all in and tended them there untilsunset, when she led them back to the cellar. All the cats in thevicinity came to call, but Polly was the very spirit of inhospitality.She always maintained an anxious guard against marauders and, at theapproach of the most amiable old gossip, would fill up the wire doorwaywith her own slender body, spitting and bristling in the very face ofthe disconcerted guest. Cinderella, the most precocious of the kittens,observed with admiration this form of welcome and scandalized allobservers by scampering to the door one day, as her mother wasreturning from a brief constitutional, and with all due ceremonies ofdefiance refusing her admission. After one astonished instant, Pollyrecovered her presence of mind, bowled out of the way that comical ballof impudence and made it her first parental duty, after entering, tobox Cinder's ears.As the kittens grew older, they had the run of the house, which theyfilled with elfin mirth of motion and reels of Puckish revel. Placed ina row on my desk, they would watch the moving pen with fascinated eyes,till one shy paw after another would steal out to investigate andpresently there would be a flurry of funny antics all over a blottedpage. By autumn they had all gone their ways to different households,except Esther's Daisy, whom we kept, but the joy of kittenhood was theonly life they had. Doom, like a black cat hunting mice, speedilycaught them all, unless, perchance, dogs and motors were kinder than wefear to Cinder, who, one winter day, after her morning saucer of milk,struck blithely out into the sunshine from the best of homes and never,though search, inquiry and advertisement did their utmost, was heard ofagain. Little Bub proved so puny that he was left with Polly,reinstated, much to her content, in her own kingdom, but not even herpuzzled solicitude, varied by cuffings, could keep him alive. As forTopsy and Daisy, I have not the heart to tell how they perished, butthough I say it as should not, Daisy was too bad for this world. Anincarnate imp, she mocked all discipline and scorned all affection,capering into new mischief at every rebuke and scratching herself freefrom caresses. Despising laps and cushions, she took to the air like anaeroplane, forever on the leap from one forbidden shelf, mantel orflower-pot to another. Her agility was supernatural. She would hangfrom a curtain cord, spring thence to the top of a door, pounce on abowing caller's back, and, within ten seconds fill the hall with suchskurry and commotion that Hecate and all her witches could have done nomore. She could not keep quiet, even at night, until HousewifeHoneyvoice devised the plan of putting her to bed in a basket, with acork dangling from the handle for her to play with in her dreams.Joy-of-Life was ill that winter and, because the kitten's pranks wouldnow and then divert a suffering hour, we bore with Daisy as long aspatience could, until, indeed, she forsook the house and set up anindependent establishment with a battered ruffian of a cat under oursouth porch. Before forsaking the house, she had derided everything init. She had, indeed, an uncanny gift of singling out for her mostprofane attentions the special objects that humankind holds sacred. Onthe top of my desk stands a small Florentine bust of Dante, whoseaustere countenance she loved to slap. Beyond it hangs a cross ofinlaid olivewood from Jerusalem, apparently inaccessible, but thisinfant athlete, precariously balancing with one foot on the curvedwoodwork of the desk and two feet clawing the wall, would stretchherself out like an elastic until her free foot could give the lowertip of the cross a smart rap and set it swinging. Punished, she wouldstrike back, hitting us in the face with an absurd, soft paw; called,she would run away; caught, she would kick and bite. Our most tactfulcajolery she met with suspicion and disdain, if not with open ridicule.Graceful as a whirling leaf, she was untamable as the wind that whirlsit,--the wildest wisp of kittenhood that ever left an aching memory.Since the tragic exit of Daisy, whose confidence I could neverwin,--and her cynical little ghost bids me admit that her distrust wasborne out by the event,--I have counted myself unworthy to take anykitten to hearth and home. I doubt if any would come. My neighborsacross the way have a lordly old Thomas, who, smelling dog on myskirts, spits at me as I mount the steps. My neighbors of the cross-cuthave a glossy black puss in a resplendent red collar, who politely butunrelentingly evades all my advances. The feline heart has found meout. Yet I still cherish a wistful regard for these delicate-footed,wary creatures, who develop so suddenly from madcap frolic intodignity, discretion and reserve, keeping even in the most domesticsurroundings a latent sense of a free life elder than civilization,when, as Swinburne tells his silken crony:    "Wild on woodland ways your sires        Flashed like fires."A friend of mine, a scholar, and therefore proud in thought and poor inpurse, living at the top of a London apartment house, had a cherishedcat by name of Fettles, who never touched the ground from September toJune. Rooms and corridor limited his promenades, except for a long boxof plants that filled the diminutive balcony. To the casual eye heseemed well content with his cloistered life, purring on cozy cushions,performing painstaking toilets, cuddling down on the table close to thearm of his mistress as she read and wrote, even condescending, for herpleasure, to play with a tassel or ball, but I noted that my arrivalsbrought to Fettles a quivering excitement. It was not my conversation,which he ignored, nor my gifts, for after his first scandalous orgy onAmerican catnip I was forbidden to bring him anything more temptingthan a chocolate mouse. It was my boots, especially if I had beenwalking across Regent Park and brought in honest earth instead ofpavement scraps and taxi smells. Fettles would rush to my feet andsniff at sole and heel and toe, arching his back and lashing his tailwhen the odors brought him peculiarly thrilling tidings of the strangeworld so far below his balcony. In the summer he was the guest of aDevonshire cottage, but for the first week or two he would befrightened by the vastness and queerness of out-of-doors. He wouldcrouch for hours on the threshold, looking out with mingled ecstasy andterror on the garden, now and then reaching down a dubious paw to touchthe warm brown earth. By degrees he could be coaxed to join hismistress at afternoon tea under the plum trees, cautiously placinghimself in touch of the hem of her gown. The summer would be half overbefore he was at ease in his brief Paradise.Fettles, by the way, was succeeded by Thomas Heywood, and Tommy Heywoodby Sisi, the only Londoner I know who enjoyed the air-raids. Whenever aZeppelin alarm scared the lodgers out of their "honey-heavy dew ofslumber," Sisi had the sport of his life. Knowing that his mistress,even if a bomb were crashing through her ceiling, would not abandonhim, he would dash hither and yon in a rapture of disobedience, nowunder the bed, now behind a bookcase, continually evading her frenziedclutches. Slippered feet went skurrying past the door, but still Sisisprang and scampered, even wheeling about in giddy circles as if thiswere the chance of chances for a kitten to catch its tail. My friend,with Sisi clasped to her panting breast, was invariably the last lodgerto reach the refuge of the cellar.The cats of legend are not as many as one would suppose, or perhaps thefault is still mine. Even here they evade me. I can call but few tomind, Puss in Boots, Sir Tybalt in the animal epic of _Reynard theFox_, the Kilkenny cats of tragic fame, the grinning Cheshire cat--forwhose like I vainly looked in Cheshire--the mysterious Knurremurre ofNorway, and the far-fabled "King of the Cats." English chronicles, nonetoo authentic, tell of a busy mouser that made Dick Whittington mayorof London, and of a faithful puss who ventured down a chimney of TheTower to cheer her imprisoned master, the Earl of Southampton, by acall. More worthy of credit is John Locke's account, preserved byHakluyt, of an honorable incident in his voyage to Jerusalem,undertaken in the spring of 1553. The pilgrim ship was about fiftymiles from Jaffa, when it "chanced by fortune that the Shippes Cat leptinto the Sea, which being downe, kept her selfe very valiauntly abovewater, notwithstanding the great waves, still swimming, the which themaster knowing, he caused the Skiffe with halfe a dosen men to goetowards her and fetch her againe, when she was almost halfe a mile fromthe shippe, and all this while the ship lay on staies. I hardly beleevethey would have made such haste and meanes if one of the company hadbeen in the like perill. They made the more haste because it was thepatrons cat. This I have written onely to note the estimation that catsare in, among the Italians, for generally they esteeme their cattes, asin England we esteeme a good Spaniell."Petrarch and Tasso are eminent witnesses to the Italian fondness forcats. The French, too, have long been famed as cat lovers; Montaigne,Chateaubriand, Gautier, Pierre Loti, Jules Lemaitre, Baudelaire, LaFontaine, Champfleury, Michelet have all written charmingly of theFireside Sphinx, leaving it to a Belgian poet, Maeterlinck, to presentpoor pussy as a stage villain. English literature takes less account ofher, though Chaucer keenly expresses the friar's choice of acomfortable seat by telling how    "fro the bench he droof awey the cat,"and Skelton has poured invective on the slayer of Philip Sparow,calling down vengeance    "On all the hole nacyon    Of cattes wilde and tame;    God send them sorowe and shame!"No reader of Tudor drama needs to be reminded of Gammer Gurton's Gyb,crouching in the fireplace, where her eyes, mistaken for sparks offire, refused to be blown out. Shakespeare's frequent references to the"harmless, necessary cat" are as accurate as they are nonchalant, butMilton does not mention her in his account of the creation, althoughshe would certainly have been more comforting to Eve, at least, than"Behemoth, biggest born of earth," or "the parsimonious emmet." Indeed,an Arabic story of the creation claims that the dog and cat wereallowed to accompany Adam and Eve, for their protection and solace,into the waste beyond the flaming sword. Herrick's "green-eyedkitling;" Walpole's Selima of    "The fair round face, the snowy beard,        The velvet of her paws,    Her coat that with the tortoise vies,    Her ears of jet and emerald eyes,"--charms all forfeit to her longing for stolen goldfish; Arnold'sAtossa    --"So Tiberius might have sat,    Had Tiberius been a cat,"--have made their way into poetry, but prose, especially the familiarprose of letters, has kept green the memory of many a pussy more. Welove Dr. Johnson the better for his consideration of Hodge "for whom,"reports Boswell, "he himself used to go out and buy oysters, lest theservants, having that trouble, should take a dislike to the poorcreature." Of course the tender-hearted Cowper cared for cats, and eventhe industrious Southey would turn his epic-blunted quill to accountsof Rumpelstilzchen and Hurlyburlybuss,--sonorous cat-names closelypressed upon by Mark Twain's Sour Mash, Apollinaris, Zoroaster andBlatherskite, while Canon Liddon's Tweedledum and Tweedledee of AmenCorner are not far behind.No portrait of a cat in English verse is more vivid than that given inthe sestette of Mrs. Marriott Watson's oft-praised sonnet:    "Sphinx of my quiet hearth! who deign'st to dwell    Friend of my toil, companion of mine ease,    Thine is the lore of Ra and Rameses;    That men forget dost thou remember well,    Beholden still in blinking reveries,    With somber, sea-green gaze inscrutable."It is pleasant to think that the race memory of puss goes farther backin time and farther east in geography than the witchcraft cruelties ofChristendom. The Mohammedan faith has been kinder to her than ours.Persia has ever held her in affection. Mahomet cut off the flowing edgeof his sleeve rather than disturb Muezza's nap. But most of all herinherent aristocracy springs from those shining centuries by the Nile,when under the protection of the moon-eyed goddess Pasht she washonored in life and embalmed in death. The supreme Ra, the Sun God, wasaddressed as "the Great Cat," and _The Book of the Dead_ holds themystic text: "I have heard the mighty word which the Ass spake unto theCat in the House of Hapt-re."TO HAMLET, A COLLIE    Strange dog, with terror planted in your heart,    At your dim root of life a piteous dread    Foreboding evil doom, a panic bred    Of some fierce shock to puppy nerves! No art    Home kindness can devise prevents your start,    Wild stare and panting breath at each new tread;    Your anxious eyes keep watch, uncomforted    By our poor love, too weak to take your part    Against that fatal menace which, for us    No less than you, lurks in the coming springs.    Of all our creeds and dreams incredulous,    Thrilled by these sudden agonies, you quake    Through all your lithe young body. What should make    A collie know the grief of mortal things?HAMLET AND POLONIUS                  "There's something in his soul    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood."    --Shakespeare's _Hamlet_.It was a beautiful morning, whose beauty could only hurt, of the firstJune since Joy-of-Life went away. All green paths were desolate forlack of her glad step. And the stately kennel that had been known fromthe first as "Sigurd's House" stood silent, its green door closed onbare floor and cobwebbed walls. Stray cats passed it unconcerned andhoptoads took their ease on the edges of "Sigurd's Drinking-cup"hollowed out in the adjacent rock. In an hour when the pain of livingseemed wellnigh unbearable, the Angel of Healing called me up bytelephone. His voice was gruff, but kindly."Say, you miss that old dog of yours a sight, don't you?"I could feel the confidential pressure of Sigurd's golden head againstmy knee as I briefly assented, recognizing the speaker as theproprietor of certain collie kennels not far distant."He had a right good home, that dog had, and you must have got prettywell used to collie ways.""If you were going to ask me to buy another collie, please don't.Sigurd is my dog--forever.""Well! Since you put it that way--but I'm at my wit's end to get rid ofa collie pup--a pretty little fellow, rough Scotch, sable and white,like yours--that's scairt at his own shadow.""What scared him?""Blest if I know! His sire, Commander, and his dam, Whisper, are asnice, normal, easy-tempered dogs as you could find anywhere, and theirlitters take after 'em--'cept this youngster, who sulks all day longoff in some dark hole by himself and shakes if we speak to him. Nobodyhas mishandled the little chap so far's I've ever seen or heard, butthe least thing--a shout or a rattle of tools or any fool noise--throwshim into such a funk that all the rest of the puppies are gettingpanicky and the whole caboodle is running wild. There's no two waysabout it. I've got to clear that born ninny out. I sold him a month agoto a lady for fifty dollars, but she brought him back in a week andsaid he was about as cheerful company as a tombstone. Now see here! Youcan have him for twenty, or for nothing, just as you feel after you'vegiven him a try.""But I don't want him. I shouldn't want him if he were the best dog inthe country.""Then I reckon I'll have to shoot him. I could give him away, but he'ssuch a wretched, shivery little rascal that most any sort of folkswould be too rough for him. 'Twould be kinder to put him out of theworld and done with it. He's had seven months of it now and pretty wellmade up his mind that he don't like it. I did think maybe you might bewilling to give him a chance."I was surprised to hear my own voice saying into the telephone: "I'lltry him for a few days, if you care to bring him over."Yet I dreaded his coming. The friend who gave us Sigurd had offered usthe past winter a very prince of puppies, the daintiest, most spirited,most winsome little collie that a free affection could ask, butJoy-of-Life and I could not make him ours. We could regard him only asa visitor in Sigurd's haunts, and the Lady of Cedar Hill, resenting thename of Guest which we had given him, re-named him Eric and took him toher own home. Here she soon won the utter devotion of his dog-heart,which, though now no longer beating, through that ardent and faithfullove "tastes of immortality."I was in the veranda off the study, trying to busy myself with my oldtoys of books and pen and paper, when the young collie was led in by asmall girl, the only person at the kennels whose call he obeyed orwhose companionship he welcomed. Deposited beside my chair, he promptlyretreated to the utmost distance the narrow limits of his prison-houseallowed, panting and quaking."Be good, Blazey," the child admonished him, stroking his head with asunburned hand from whose light caress he at once shuddered away. "I'llcome to see you by and by.""By and by is easily said," the puppy made answer with incredulous eyesthat first watched her out of sight and then rolled in anguish ofdespair from the wire screening of the porch to roof and wall."Is your name Blazey?" I asked him gently, but his fit of ague onlygrew worse as he turned his ghastly stare on me            "with a look so piteous in purport    As if he had been loosed out of hell    To speak of horrors.""I made further efforts at conversation while the day wore on, but thatlittle yellow image of throbbing terror, upright in the remotestcorner, would not even turn its head toward my voice. In vain Iremonstrated:                    "Alas, how is't with you,    That you do bend your eye on vacancy    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep."The constant tremble of the poor, scared, pitiful puppy was intensifiedby every train whistle and motor horn to a violent shaking. I could notflutter a leaf nor drop a pencil without causing a nervous twitch ofthe brown ears. Suddenly the crack of an early Fourth of July torpedoelectrified him into a frenzy of fright. If it had been the fatal shotin reserve for Blazey he could not have made a madder leap nor wheeledabout in more distracted circles. In one of these lunatic reels hestruck against me and, gathering him close, I crooned such comfort as Ihad into that dizzy, quivering, pathetic face; but he tore himselfloose and fled gasping back to his corner beseeching a perilous andcruel universe to let him alone. I, for one, declined:    "Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!--    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,    Thou comest in such a questionable shape    That I will speak to thee; I'll call thee Hamlet."The puppy accepted his new name, as he accepted his dinner, withlugubrious resignation and the air of saying to himself:                "Heaven hath pleas'd it so,    To punish me with this, and this with me."His misery was more appealing than a thousand funny gambols could havebeen, and the household, those of us who were left, conspired invarious friendly devices to make him feel at home. The child at thekennels had taught him one sole accomplishment, that of giving his paw,and Sister Jane, in a fine spirit of sacrifice, made a point of shakinghands with him long and politely at least a dozen times a day, rushingto a faucet as soon as this hospitable rite was accomplished for afierce scouring of her own polluted palms. Housewife Honeyvoice temptedhis appetite with the most savory of puppy menus and kept up such aflow of tuneful comment while he ate that, even in his days of deepestgloom, he rarely failed to polish his dish and then thump it all aboutin an unscientific effort to extract gravy from tinware. Esther's armswere now as strong as her feet were lively and, after the first week orso, he would let her pick him up like a baby and carry him about andwould even be surprised, at times, into a game of romps. He needed playas much as he needed food, but he was curiously awkward at it, notmerely with the usual charming clumsiness of puppies but with ablundering uncertainty in all his movements, miscalculating his jumps,lighting in a sprawling heap and often hurting himself by a lop-sidedtumble.Yet apart from these brief lapses he maintained his pose of hopelessmelancholy, varied by frantic perturbations, until his new name fittedhim like his new collar.    "How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable    Seem to me all the uses of this world!"He was not, to be sure,    "The glass of fashion and the mold of form,"for his nose, from the bench point of view, was nearly half an inch toolong. But his "dejected haviour" and deep-rooted suspicion of hissurroundings were Hamlet's own. He felt himself "be-netted round withvillanies" and apprehensively watched the simple ways of our family inprofound despondency and distrust. The fears that haunted him kept himso hushed that we grew to believe he was actually dumb,--a defect inphysical endowment that might account for many abnormalities. Now andthen the rigid little figure beside me on the veranda--for gradually,day by day, he edged an inch or two nearer--would give a stir ofweariness or even drop, exhausted, for a nap, but in the main                    "as patient as the female dove    When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,    His silence" would "sit drooping."Through all the hot summer days I had to see him,    "A dull and muddy mettled rascal, peak    Like John-a-dreams,"but as soon as we reached the cool cover of dusk, I would lift the nowcrouching, anxious puppy to his four feet and snap on his new leash.His troubled eyes would well over with expostulatory questions:    "Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?""We're going to walk, Little Stick-in-the-Mud. Come on!"And thus Hamlet, "with much forcing of his disposition," would undergothe daily constitutional, which he converted into a genuine gymnasticexercise for us both by pulling back on the leash with all hisconsiderable strength, protesting:    "It is not, nor it cannot come to good;    But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue."In this ignoble fashion I would drag him along for a mile or so of theleast frequented road, until he would suddenly fix his slender legs andrefuse to be budged:    "Where wilt thou lead me? speak;    I'll go no further.""Very well! If you insist on turning back here, you know what willhappen. It will be your turn to drag me."To this he had always the same rejoinder:                "'Tis true 'tis pity,    And pity 'tis 'tis true."So Hamlet, all his soul set on getting back to the comparative securityof that veranda, would fall to tugging like an infant Hercules,scrabbling me along, regardless of sidewalks, by the nearest route tosafety, till I felt myself, on reaching home, more than ever a"quintessence of dust."When I tried him off the leash, he would, even into the autumn, runback to the kennels, though he would let no one there touch him but thegypsy-tanned child. Later, he would slip back to the Scarab, usuallyafter dark, but be afraid to come near or ask admittance, sweepingaround the house in wide, wistful circles. It took our softest coaxingsto bring that palpitating puppy across the threshold and, once in, weall had to shake paws with him many times before he would believehimself welcome and sink down at my feet to sleep away his tirednessand terror. It was midsummer before I dared loose him on the campus fora free scamper, from which, hesitant, with many tremors and recoils, hecame back to me in answer to my call. I thought then that the battlewas won, but the next time I ventured it, and the next, he ran away.Yet before the leaves fell we had made such progress that when Ifastened on his leash and invited him to go to walk,      "there did seem in him a kind of joy    To hear of it."For weeks the rooms of the house were to this kennel-bred puppy nobetter than torture-chambers, being full of strange, sinister objects,for to Hamlet, even yet, the unknown is a menace and a dread. Broughtinto study or dining-room, he would "wax desperate with imagination,"throwing wild looks at ceiling and walls and then spinning about andabout like an agonized top. "Upon the heat and flame" of thoseexcitements it was hard to persuade him to "sprinkle cool patience,"but in process of time he became accustomed to rugs and furniture andeven, after repeated assurances, grew to understand that Sigurd's chairwas at his service.By mid-winter he had come to realize, with a touching relief andresponsive fervor of affection, that the members of the family were hisfriends, but he was still thrown into a panic by the door-bell and themurderous monsters whose entrance he believed it to announce. Everyarrival he regarded as an agent of Hamlet's doom and fled precipitatelyto chosen places of concealment on the upper floors. Yet curiosity wasstrong in the little fellow, too. As I sat chatting with a caller, Iwould presently be aware of an excessively unobtrusive collie stealingdown the stairs. Quivering all over, in awe of his own daring, he wouldplace himself erect on the threshold with his face to the hall and veryslowly, inch by inch, would "like a crab" back into the room, edgingalong on his haunches, steering his blind course for the further sideof my chair. Still keeping his back to the stranger, he would reach upa pleading paw for me to clasp and then, regarding himself as bothinvisible and protected, listen keenly to learn if the conversationwere by any chance about Hamlet.He was as timorous out of doors as in, having little to do with otherdogs, save with a benignant collie neighbor, old Betty, and yielding uphis choicest bones without remonstrance to any impudent marauder. If Ireproached him for his pacifist bearing, he would touch my hand with anapologetic tongue and look up with shamefaced eyes that admitted:                      "it cannot be    But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall    To make oppression bitter."It was his habit to take legs, rather than arms, "against a sea oftroubles," and when enemies loomed on the horizon he wouldprecipitately make for home. He was by this time dog enough to beoverjoyed if one of us summoned him for a walk.    "What noise? who calls on Hamlet?"And all his belated frolic of puppyhood came out in impatient colliecapers while, with our intolerable human tardiness, wraps were donnedand doors thrown open. And then the leaps of ecstasy!    "Go on; I'll follow thee."But he hated, and still hates, to be out in the great, dangerous worldof noises, people, motors, alone by daylight. "Nay, come, let's gotogether," is his constant plea. But if no one of the household is atliberty to companion him, he prefers to wait for his exercise till "thevery witching time of night," when he plunges into the mystery of thewoods or runs by moonlight along deserted roads. During his firstwinter, on returning from one of his nocturnal rambles, he would stand,snow-coated, without a whine or scratch, shivering at the outside door,silent even under the beating of an icy storm, until some anxiouswatcher caught sight of him and let him in. He had been with us over ayear before he found his voice. Then, one noon, a brisk step coming upto the south porch along our private path took Hamlet by surprise. Hisquick, shrill protest astonished him as much as it did us and hepromptly rushed to refuge under the table. But having shattered ourpsychopathic theories and confessed that he was no mute, he took tobarking with immoderate enthusiasm that has already more than made upfor lost time. Yet as with his movements, so his barking isodd,--discordant, off the pitch, "jangled out of tune."These tremendous bouts of barking, combined with his excitable andsuspicious temperament, have given our timid collie a preposterousreputation for ferocity. Callers wise in dogs observe that even as heroars he runs away, wagging his tail, and come boldly on to the northdoor, while Hamlet announces and denounces them at the south:    "O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!"    "A guilty thing."    "A puff'd and reckless libertine."    "A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!"    "What, ho! help, help, help!"But when he has torn his "passion to tatters, to very rags," he slipsin shyly to greet the accepted caller, usually seating himself,according to his own peculiar code of etiquette, with his back to theguest, but sometimes, especially if it is a college girl "in the mornand liquid dew of youth," he will, instead of taking his accustomedplace by me, lie down at Ophelia's feet, explaining:    "Here's metal more attractive."Hamlet is a delicate subject for discipline as any sign of displeasureon the part of the few he trusts will fling him back to his puppy stateof quivering misery. But for his inhospitable clamors he isoccasionally shut up in the telephone closet, a custom which heconsiders    "More honour'd in the breach than the observance."Released, he bounds toward us beseeching caresses and every assurancethat we have forgiven him and love him still. But he is just as readyto bark at the next arrival, though the dread word CLOSET willsometimes arrest a roar in mid-career. His sense of duty, as theguardian of the house, is inextricably intertwisted with his desire tobe good.Hamlet has, indeed, an uncharacteristic conviction of the preciousnessof property. He did not learn it from me. I resent the metal thatoutlasts flesh and bone and am careless about locking doors sinceagainst grief and death no bolts avail; but Hamlet, had destiny put himin his proper place, would have ridden through life on top of anexpress wagon, zealously guarding its packages from every thievishtouch. As it is, he keeps an embarrassing watch and ward on my desk andbookcases. Often a seminar student, reaching for a volume that promisesto throw light on the discussion, is amazed by the leap of what hadseemed to be a slumbering collie, now all alert and vigilant, gentlynipping her sleeve to hold that arm of robbery back. Or in the midst ofcommittee toils, a guileless colleague may move toward my desk to makea note. From the hall Hamlet dashes in with gleaming eyes and, as sheturns in astonishment, squeezes his yellow bulk between her and thatmysterious altar of my midnight devotion and firmly shoves her back.These policeman ways of his are not universally endearing and, inreturn, he has no faith whatever in the honesty of my associates,"arrant knaves all." He has never put aside his dark suspicions of onewho is not only generosity itself, but a socialist to boot, because onhis first Christmas Eve in the Scarab she had been so kind as to act asher own Santa Claus and take away her labeled packet from the pile oftissue-papered and gay-ribboned gifts in a corner of the study.Although I had noticed that the puppy made a point of lying down beforethat heap, I did not realize that he, terrified and bashful as he thenwas, had constituted himself its custodian, till this action of hersleft his soul "full of discord and dismay." Even yet he heralds herapproach with consternation:    "O shame! where is thy blush?"    "A most pernicious woman!"    "Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief."So our dog has few friends outside his home. It is difficult tomaintain with the children on the hill the pleasant fiction that theirChristmas playthings come from Hamlet when it so obviously "harrows"him "with fear and wonder" to see the little recipients allowed to bearthese objects away. Laddie's mistress, ever gracious, pets and praiseshim, and hers is the only home in the village at which, sure of a happywelcome and delectable bits of bread and butter, he consents to call,but Jack's mistress, catholic as her sympathies are, remembers anunlucky encounter from which her famous comrade retired, blinkingqueerly, the loser of a tooth. It is, of course, her theory that Hamletfeloniously reached into Jack's mouth to snap out that treasure, whileto me it seems crystal clear that Jack uprooted the venerable fanghimself in an unholy effort to bite Hamlet; but now the collie is shutup whenever the terrier comes, though they manage to exchange throughthe windows a vituperative language not taught in our curriculum.Hoping to extend this too limited circle of Hamlet's friendships, wehave accepted as a summer guest a cynical old parrot, who has already,in a lifetime cruelly long for a captive, known a variety of vanishinghouseholds. The tones that Poor Pol echoes, the names that he calls,insistently and vainly, in his lonesome hours, the scraps of familytalk dating perhaps from five, ten, twenty years ago that his strangevoice, a mockery of the human, still repeats, make him, even to us, anawesome personage, a Wandering Jew of the caged-pet generations. Whatdoes he miss, what does he remember, as he sits sweetly crooning tohimself "Peek-a-boo, Pol," and then rasps crossly out, "Wal! what _is_it?" and then falls to a direful groaning "Oh!" and "Ah!" over andover, more and more feebly, as if in mimicry of a death-bed, andsuddenly spreads his wings, hurrahs like a boy on the Glorious Fourthand storms our ears with a whole barn-yard of cackles andcocka-doodledoos?For the first few minutes after the arrival of Polonius, Hamletregarded the great cage, set on top of a tall revolving bookcase, andits motionless perching inmate, whose plumage of sheeny green wasdiversified by under-glints of red and the pride of a golden nape, asnew ornaments committed to his guardianship. Erect on his haunches, hegazed up at them with an air of earnest responsibility, but whenPolonius, cocking his head and peering down on the collie with oneround orange eye, crisply remarked:"Hello! What's that? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" Hamlet went wild withamazement. After making from every side vain leaps and scrambles towardthe unperturbed parrot, he tore from one of us to another, with whinesand imploring gaze striving to learn what this apparition might mean    "So horridly to shake" his "disposition    With thoughts beyond the reaches" of his soul.A week has passed and I begin to fear that Hamlet's antipathy toPolonius, "a foolish prating knave," a "wretched, rash, intrudingfool," is too deeply rooted in drama for life to eradicate. The faultdoes not lie with the parrot. Though with him, as a rule, "brevity isthe soul of wit," he accosts Hamlet quite as cordially as any othermember of the family, with "Hello" when the dog trots into the room and"Good-by" when he trots out. He is, indeed, so far in sympathy withHamlet that, well-nigh to our despair, he seconds the collie's uncivilclamor when the doorbell rings by stentorian shouts of "Fire! _Fire!!_FIRE!!!" We do not admit that, in general, Polonius talks only "words,words, words." If he does, the coincidences are uncanny, for he warns"Look out" as we lift his heavy cage and pronounces "All right" as weset it safely down. I was adding a column of figures yesterday and, asI named the total, Polonius said in an approving tone: "That's right;that's it." He has a mild curiosity about our doings and occasionallyresponds to our overtures by offering to an outstretched finger thechilly grip of his clay-colored claws,--invariably, like a well-bredbird, presenting the right foot. If Housewife Honeyvoice undertakes toscratch the parrot's green head, Hamlet rears up against her andinsists that the same ceremony be performed on his yellow one.Polonius, for his part, though too blas? for jealousy, has a properself-respect, and when he overhears us comforting our troubled colliewith murmurs of "Good Hamlet! Dear Hamlet!" promptly interjects "PrettyPol."But Hamlet, who is so sensitive to suffering that he will go of his ownimpulse to any visitor in trouble and press close, lavishing all hisshy caresses in the effort to console, need not fear that Polonius willusurp his place in my affection. It is all I have to give him and Ishall not fail him there. I cannot give that fearful, only half-quietedheart the security it craves from          "the thousand natural shocks    That flesh is heir to."There is no security on this whirring planet where pain is pain, andloss is loss, but where, for our deepest of consolation, though itinvolves our keenest of grief, love is always love."Keep me close," pleads Hamlet, and I promise: "While I can."End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sigurd Our Golden Collie and OtherComrades of the Road, by Katharine Lee Bates*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SIGURD OUR GOLDEN COLLIE ******** This file should be named 33134-8.txt or 33134-8.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/3/1/3/33134/Produced by Mark C.

She remembers _you_, however,and sends you this soldier story with her very best love--the love shebears in her inmost heart for God and little children. And now she asksyou to hunt in every corner of those same precious little heads for akindly remembrance of your affectionate friend,                                           "AUNT FANNY'S" DAUGHTER.THE STORY OF THE SOCKS.BY AUNT FANNY."OH dear! what _shall_ I do?" cried George, fretfully, one rainyafternoon. "Mamma, do tell me what to do.""And I'm _so_ tired!" echoed Helen, who was lazily playing with a kittenin her lap. "I don't see why it should rain on a Friday afternoon, whenwe have no lessons to learn. We can't go out, and no one can come to seeus. It's too bad, there!""Helen, do _you_ know better than _God_?" asked her mother, speakingvery gravely. "You forget that He sends the rain.""I suppose I was thoughtless, mamma," answered the child; "I did notmean to be wicked, but, dear me, the time passes _so_ slowly, withnothing to do.""Have you and George read all your books?""Oh yes! two or three times over," they both answered; "and oh, mamma,"continued Helen, "if the one who wrote 'Two Little Heaps,' or the'Rollo' book writer, or the author of 'The Little White Angel,' wouldonly write some more books, I, for one, would not care how hard itrained. If I was grown up and rich, I wouldn't mind giving a dollar aletter for those stories.""Nor I," shouted George in an animated tone, quite different from thediscontented whine he had favored his mother with a few moments before;"the best thing is to have them read aloud to you; that makes youunderstand all about it so much better. I say, mamma, couldn't you writea letter to one of those delightful people and beg them to hurry up withmore stories, especially some about bad children;--not exactly wicked,you know, but full of mischief. _Then I am sure that they are all true._Only wait till I'm a man! I'll just write the history of some jollyfellows I know who are always getting into scrapes, but haven't a scrapof meanness about them. That's the kind of book I like! I'll writedozens of them, and give them to all the Sunday school libraries."His mother smiled at this speech, and then said quietly, "I know agentleman who likes the story of 'The Little White Angel,' as much asyou do, and he has written a letter to request the author to write sixbooks for him.""Six! hurrah!" shouted George, "how glad I am!" and he skipped up toHelen, caught her by the hands, and the two danced round the room,upsetting a chair, till Helen, catching her foot in the skirt of hermother's dress, they both tumbled down on the carpet together."If you cut up such violent capers," said the kind mother, laughing,"at the first part of my information, it may be dangerous to tell youwhat the author replied.""Oh no, do tell us!" cried the children. "We'll be as still as ourshadows;" and while they made violent efforts to look grave and standquiet, their mother told them that the author had consented, the sixbooks were to be written, and she would buy them the very first day theywere published. "Perhaps," she continued, "mind, only perhaps, I may getthem for you _before_ they are ever printed.""Why, how, mamma?" they both asked."Well, suppose you make some very good resolutions--let me see," andshe took a pencil out of her pocket, and drawing a sheet of paper towardher, began to write:"1st. To endeavor to say your prayers morning and evening without a_wandering thought_."2d. To try to keep faithfully 'the Golden Rule.'"3d. To obey your parents immediately, without asking 'why?'"4th. (A little rule, but very important.) To keep your teeth, nails,and hair scrupulously clean and neat."5th. To bear disappointments cheerfully."There, I think that will do. They are all hard rules except the fourth.I do not keep them well myself, my dear children. No one can, withoutconstant watchfulness and prayer for help from above; but you can try,will you?""I will, mamma," said Helen, in a low, earnest tone, her blue eyesfilling with tears."And you, George, will you?""Yes, mamma, I will try. I can't be a very good boy, as you know. I getso tired of being good sometimes, that I feel like jumping over thehouse to get the badness out of me, instead of sitting down quietly andthinking about my duty, as papa says I must. When papa locked me up inhis dressing room last summer, and I kicked the door as hard as ever Icould, which made him call out that I should stay there two hourslonger, I was mad enough, I tell you! but I did not cut my name with aknife on his rosewood bureau _because_ I was angry. It was because I wasalmost crazy with doing nothing but think what a bad boy I was. Thatmade me worse, you see. The best way to punish me is to see you cryingabout my conduct. I can't stand that," and the boy put his arms roundhis mother's neck, and kissed her fondly."My dear boy," said his mother, returning the caress, "there is One whomyou grieve more than me. I wish you would think oftener of that. I knowthat different children require different sorts of punishment, and asneither your father nor I approve of beating you like a dog, and yousay that shutting you up with nothing to do only makes you worse, Ishall advise him the next time you are naughty, to send immediately fora load of wood, and make you saw it all up into small pieces, or takeyou where some house is building and order you to run up and down a longladder all day with a hod of bricks on your shoulder, or hire you out toblow the big bellows for a blacksmith. How do you think you would likethat?""I had a great deal rather run after the fire engines, to put the fireout. That's the kind of work I would like. Every body screaming, andpumping, and playing streams of water--twenty firemen rushing upladders, pulling old women and cats out of the windows, and somebodyinside pitching out the looking glasses and crockery to save them! Iwish our house was on fire this very minute, so I could pull you andHelen out, and save all the furniture. That would be the greatest fun inthe world!""Please don't set fire to the house," cried his mother, laughing, "forthe fun of saving our lives. I prefer to keep it just as it is, andwalking quietly out at the door." As she spoke, the sun suddenly burstforth from the clouds, and his bright rays darting into the room, thechildren sprang joyfully up, and, with their mother's consent, were soonout of the house with jumping-rope and hoop, to join their littlecompanions in a neighboring park.George and Helen were two charming, ingenuous children. George was fullof frolic, mischief, and fun, with generous impulses and excellentintentions, which only required peculiar and careful training andencouragement to develop him into a steady, high-principled man. Lockinghim up with nothing to do, as he truly said, did him more harm thangood; he required active punishment, and his mother wisely intended totake the hint for his future benefit. Her little Helen, though just asfull of play and fun, was more easily managed. A present of a book sowon upon her love and gratitude, that her mother had only to hold outthe prospect of a new one, and a loving kiss (Helen prized the kiss evenmore than the book) as a reward for good behavior, to make her quite apattern of a dear, amiable little girl.The next morning the kind mother called upon her friend Aunt Fanny,bringing George and Helen with her, as it was Saturday. First she toldall the conversation of the afternoon before, which amused Aunt Fannyvery much, and then she continued, "You told me the other day that yourdaughter was very busy writing six books for Mr. Leavitt the publisher.I know you love my children.""Yes, indeed!" cried Aunt Fanny. "I love children from my heart,straight out to the ends of my fingers; and when a pen is in my hands,the love runs into it, and then out again, as fast as it can scratch allover ever so many sheets of paper. My thumb aches so sometimes withwriting, that I often wish I had half a dozen extra ones, so I couldtake the tired one off and screw another on, and even then I am afraid Icould never exhaust my love for my darlings;" and she looked at thechildren and held out her hand with such an affectionate smile, thatHelen came timidly up and gave her a little winning kiss immediately,while George, blushing all over his face, showed two great dimples inhis cheeks, but had not the courage to leave his chair.You may be sure that Aunt Fanny, after Helen's kiss, was quite ready togrant any favor the mother might ask for her children. She was perfectlywilling to catch a comet for them to play with, or jump down a volcanoto find out who lived in the bottom of it, if anybody would only showher how. Helen's mother knew this, but she hesitated a little before shemade this strange request:"My dear friend, my two children have made me the promises I have toldyou of, in regard to keeping my little rules and resolutions, and now Ithink it will be the most wonderful and delightful reward possible, ifthey were to be permitted to see and read your daughter's stories inmanuscript.""Manuscript! what does that mean, mamma?""In her own handwriting, dear.""Oh yes! yes! how very strange and delightful! And then to see the verysame stories printed! that would be so astonishing! We should like thatbetter than anything, Aunt Fanny!""Very well," continued their mamma; "now I have come to beg you to lendme the stories as fast as they are written. I will take the greatestcare of them, and return them to your daughter quickly and punctually. Ihave a plan in my head which will make my children very happy, if youconsent.""To be sure I will," said Aunt Fanny, "but what is your plan?"Thereupon commenced a great whispering between the two ladies, while thechildren looked pleased, puzzled, and eagerly curious all at once; butthey were not to know. Aunt Fanny and their mother, after a great dealof nodding of heads together, and laughing and whispering, got thismysterious affair settled to their satisfaction, and then took leave ofeach other. Aunt Fanny kissed Helen, and George, too, in spite of hisblushes, and told them to bottle up their patience so that it would lastfor one whole week, observing that she was thankful that curiosity wasnot made of gunpowder, and there was no danger of their blowing upbefore the great secret came out.It is very seldom that you hear of such remarkably good children asGeorge and Helen were for the next few days. They were really somethingastonishing! George did not slam the door more than once or twice in awhole day; and one morning when he was going to ride on the bannistersas usual, he said "Oh, I forgot!" and immediately walked down stairs asslowly and gravely as a grandfather.As for Helen, she was, if possible, still more wonderful, for shelearned "six times" in the multiplication table, and said it straighton, and skipping, and even backward, in a way that surprised herteacher. Helen could say "twice one" up to "five times twelve," veryglibly, but "six times" never would stay in her head, she said;especially "six times nine." She always said it was "seventy-two," or"sixty-three," or "eighty-one," at a desperate venture, and was alwayswrong. Now she knew, and meant to remember; and would pack away the factthat "six times nine are fifty-four," in a comfortable place in the verymiddle of her head, to be ready for any one that wanted to know it.At last the next Friday came, and just before the children retired forthe night, their mother said:"Something came for you to-day. Guess what it is?"Up they both sprang, exclaiming, "Something for us? Oh, that is so verydelightful! What can it be?""My instructions are, to put it either in George's sock or in Helen'sstocking, after you are fast asleep. It is for both of you, and I leaveyou to decide where it shall be put.""In my sock!" shouted George."In my stocking!" cried Helen."Oh certainly, I forgot!" exclaimed George, generously; "in Helen'sstocking.""No, mamma," said Helen, "in George's sock.""Stocking!" cried George."Sock!" cried Helen.They kept this up about a dozen times, laughing and jumping about theroom like two crazy monkeys, their mamma and papa laughing too, tillall their faces were in a perfect glow, which made them look like a veryhandsome family--for, let me tell you, that good humor and innocentmerriment are very becoming to everybody, while ill-temper makes onelook like a fright.But how was this difficult matter of sock and stocking to be settled?Why, by the children's papa, to be sure! for he was a lawyer, and didnothing all day long but settle difficulties, or make them worse, Idon't know which.He took two long slips of paper, and wrote "Socks" on one and"Stockings" on the other. These he put in his hat, which George broughtout of the hall. Then he rang the bell, and told the waiter who answeredit to request Mrs. Custard, the cook, to come up to the parlor for amoment.Mrs. Custard, who was very fat, and, besides, had the rheumatism, cameinto the room quite breathless, looking very much surprised and a littlefrightened. She had dropped her thimble that day, when she was sewing upthe stuffing in the turkey, and had not had time to look for it; and shewas panic struck lest her master had found it roasted in the very middleof the turkey, and was going to ask her if she thought she was cookingfor an ostrich, which, as everybody knows, prefers a dinner of ironspikes, pebble stones, and oyster shells to roast beef.But nothing of the kind happened. The children's papa only said, "Goodevening, Mrs. Custard, you gave us a very nice dinner to-day. I want youto put your hand in this hat and draw out one piece of paper.""Laws me, sir!" exclaimed the cook, "I hopes you don't mean to play notrick on me; will it bite?"The children fairly screamed with laughter at the idea of a piece ofpaper biting; and the cook made them laugh still harder, when she puther hand in very cautiously, and twitched it out three times, before sheventured to feel for the paper.At last one piece was caught, and on it was written "SOCKS," which madeGeorge first jump up and down in an ecstacy of delight, and then run toHelen and tell her he was really sorry that it had not been the other.This decided the momentous question, and Mrs. Custard hobbled downstairs, and the children hopped, skipped, and jumped up stairs, bothwondering what would come of this magical word "socks."Helen had a pretty little room opening out of her mother's, but George'swas in an upper story. When they were both asleep, the mother took outof her son's bureau a clean white sock, sewed a tape loop on the edge,put a small parcel inside, and hung it on a neat brass nail, which wasdriven in a door directly opposite his bed, where it would catch his eyeas soon as he awoke.You may be sure both the children were up bright and early the nextmorning. Helen dressed herself quickly and ran down stairs into thedining-room to wait for her brother.George opened his eyes upon the sock the very first thing. He sprang outof bed and made but two steps to the door, raised his hand eagerly, andthen the generous little fellow stopped."No!" he cried aloud, "I will not even squeeze the outside to guess whatit is, till I am with Helen."[Illustration: GEORGE AND HELEN READING "SOCKS"]He did not stop to count his toes or fingers, though he did manage toclean his teeth, wash his face, neck, and hands, and brush his hairin about five minutes, then taking hold of the precious sock by the loopat the top, he carried it down stairs very much as if he had hold of amouse by the tail. He was met by Helen at the door with an "Oh, George,what is it?"They both stared with all their eyes, while George told Helen she mighttake the wonderful thing out. She gladly obeyed, and drew out a compactroll of letter paper neatly tied with sky-blue ribbon. Helen untied thelittle bow, her fingers trembling with eagerness, and unrolled thepaper. It seemed to be a great many pages covered with writing, and theywere all fastened together at the top with another bit of blue ribbon.The fair and clear handwriting was delightful to look at."Oh, mamma! Oh papa! do come and look!" cried George. "I do believe thisis a story before it is printed. See! on the top of the page is written'Colonel Freddy; or, the March and Encampment of the Dashahed Zouaves.'""Yes; Aunt Fanny sent it to me yesterday; and her daughter hopes herlittle story about soldiers will please you.""Please us! I guess it will! I'd rather hear about soldiers than anybodyelse in the world, even giants! because, you know, mamma, Uncle Charleyhas gone to fight, and if the Southerners had only put off the war a fewyears longer, I would have gone to fight them too; so Hurrah for theDashahed Zouaves!""Three cheers for the Dashahed Zouaves!" cried Helen, and they weregiven with a will.The children could hardly eat their breakfast in their eagerness to hearthe story which was sent to them before it was printed. This latter factgave it an extraordinary interest which they could not explain. Itseemed to be such a remarkable honor to be singled out in this way;particularly as their mother told them, before she began to read, thatAunt Fanny had requested them to be sure to let her know if they thoughtany part stupid or too long, and her daughter would improve and shortenit immediately.How extremely complimentary! to be asked to sit and listen as criticsand judges, and they only children! Really, it was almost too much tobelieve!But it added tremendously to the charm, and George and Helen took theirseats after breakfast, invested with this new and important dignity,with such an expression of solemn delight on their faces, that theirmother had to run out of the room and have a good laugh by herself inthe hall, after which she returned, and, with as serious a face as shecould call up with those two little figures so stiff and stark beforeher, smoothed out the manuscript, and began as follows:COLONEL FREDDY;OR,THE MARCH AND ENCAMPMENT OF THE DASHAHED ZOUAVES.CHAPTER I.RAISING A REGIMENT.ONE bright afternoon last summer, about two weeks after the dreadfulbattle of Bull Run, Freddy Jourdain burst open the door of his mother'sroom and rushed in, exclaiming: "Jolly, mother! such fun! What _do_ youthink the boys in our school are going to do?""Why what?" asked his mother."Yes, I should really like to know why you come tearing up stairsyelling like forty steam engines!" added his sister Bella, who wasrather a particular young lady."Well," began Freddy, looking very important, "I'll _try_ to explain,but I don't believe _you women_ can understand about _us boys_!""After that speech I think you had better explain," said Bella, "ifyou're not in want of a thimble pie on your knuckles.""Well, then," cried Freddy, with sparkling eyes, "the boys at our schoolare all _square_ against that old Jeff. Davis, and in recess yesterday,we concluded that we ought to go and help shoot the Southerners. Sowe've organized a regiment, and I'm chosen Colonel; and I'm going totake my regiment to camp on Monday, that is, if you'll let me. Mayn't I,mother? It's such fun, and Tom Pringle's given me such a jolly popgun!Hurrah for Jackson and the Stars and Stripes!" So saying, Freddy cut acaper in the air, that made about forty "chaney alleys," "stony alleys,""glass agates," and "middles," pop out of his satchel, which was slungover one shoulder, and roll into all the corners of the room."Where is your encampment to be?" said his mother, as gravely as shecould."Oh, down on Mr. Schermerhorn's place at Astoria. Peter Schermerhorntold us to-day that his father was willing we should have it there, andhas invited us all to come and stay a whole week. We're to live in _realtents_!" (here Freddy couldn't help cutting another caper,) "and cookour own dinners, and--oh, mother, mayn't I go? say!""I do not think of any objection at present," replied Mrs. Jourdain,"but you must wait until your father comes home, and hear what he has tosay. It was very kind of Mr. Schermerhorn to invite you all, but I amafraid he will be driven distracted with such a number of harem-scaremboys running about his place."At this moment Joseph, the black waiter, knocked at the door, andannounced, with an air of high-flown elegance, that "Major Schermerhornwas in the _drawing salon_ (which he considered the purest ParisianFrench for front parlor), and desired to see Col. Jourdain;" and ouryoung friend was off like a shot, Joseph following at a dignified pace.Joseph, like most other colored servants in New York, was a person ofthe highest fashion, according to his own notions. No short words for_him_, I can tell you. I remember well the first time I called upon hismistress, I inquired, "Does Mrs. Jourdain live here?" and Joseph,drawing himself up with an air of superior refinement, replied, "Mrs.Jourdain _resides_ here, madam." At dinner parties, when he waited upontable, he was the most dignified person present, and held his head up sohigh that he looked as if it would shortly go through the chandelier. Hewas always dressed in the finest broadcloth and patent leather, hisblack face and white necktie presenting an admirable contrast, while heused all the five cornered words in the dictionary in replying to anyquestion, and always handed the dishes to the ladies with a flourish ofthe most astonishing character.Now, if I tell you a secret, you must promise not to let any one knowit. Freddy's parents live in the Fifth avenue above Madison Square, inthe city of New York. His father is a rich man, and Freddy, a bright,manly lad, between thirteen and fourteen at the time I am writingabout, and the only son, is a good deal indulged. But don't think heever abuses the kindness of his loving papa and mamma; no--although heis full of noise, fun, and innocent mischief, he is a good, obedientlittle fellow--and that is why they love to do all they can to make himhappy. But you must not tell that I said where he lives.When Mr. Jourdain came home that evening, Freddy, of course, began totell him the first thing, about the regiment and Mr. Schermerhorn'sdelightful invitation. You may be sure he gave a full-length descriptionof the pleasures of camp life, as retailed by Peter to an enthusiasticaudience at recess; and backed up his request to go by such powerfulpleas of sparkling, eager eyes, flushed, happy face, and irresistible,dimpling smile, that the hardest-hearted papa in existence would havesaid "yes." Mr. Jourdain, being anything but hard-hearted, readilyconsented, as he was intimately acquainted with Mr. Schermerhorn andfamily, and knew there was no fear on a private place of their meetingwith danger, or getting into trouble.Then his father went on to ask a great many questions about theregiment, how many boys belonged to it, what their sizes were, and wherethey lived; all of which Freddy delightedly answered, and kept up acontinuous chattering until a quarter past nine, which, being his bedtime, he was reluctantly obliged to trot up stairs.After he was fairly out of the room, his father and mother had a longconsultation, which resulted next day in Mr. Jourdain's paying a visitto "Brooks Brothers," the tailors in Broadway, and afterward going to acertain store in Maiden Lane, which had all manner of toy knapsacks andguns in the window. What could he have gone there for, I wonder? andthen betaken himself to the police station in B---- street? Really, itseems very mysterious, but wait a little, and you'll see.Meanwhile Freddy, with his satchel hanging down his back to look asmuch like a knapsack as possible, marched off to school bright andearly; whistling the "Star-spangled Banner" as he went along, andlooking with the utmost pity upon strange boys, who hadn't the honor ofbelonging to his glorious regiment, the "Dashahed Zouaves," as hisfather had advised him to name it.He reached Dr. Larned's academy just as Peter, Harry, and half a dozenothers were going in. They greeted him directly with a shout of "Well,Fred, what does your father say?""Oh, I'm to go!" cried Freddy, "I say, fellows, what do you think of theDashahed Zouaves for a name?""That's splendid! capital!" was the cry of the party. I am afraid Imust add that Peter said "that's _gay_!"There was no time to talk now, however, for it was full nine o'clock; sothe boys, hanging up their hats in the hall, entered the school room,and prayers over, the lessons began.But who could be very attentive to his _ante_-cedents, or_uncle_-cedents either, when, in three days, the _se_-cedents were to beutterly routed by the Dashahed Zouaves? The boys were so full of chuckleand bounce, that, I'm afraid, poor Dr. Larned would have become crackedand crazy, if he hadn't reflected that the holidays and Fourth of July,or, as Peter called it, "the Fourth of Ju-New Year's" were coming, andthat probably the state of things was owing to those important facts.The recitations on that memorable Friday, however, were somethingwonderful, sure enough. For instance, the lesson in geography was aboutChina. The doctor asked a boy, "Where is Shanghai situated?" and hereplied, "On Long Island, about two miles from Astoria landing!--thatis," and there he stopped, looking as awkward and silly as a Shanghaichicken."Won't do, sir," said the doctor, in a grave tone, "you must study thelesson over again, and go down one;" and down he had to go, feelingrather flat.Then the doctor asked Freddy what the principal manufactures were, andhe answered, "Tea, porcelain, silk, and Zouave drill--no, no, the otherkind of drill! dear me, what do I mean?""I cannot imagine," returned Doctor Larned, in a severe tone, but with alittle bit of a smile hiding in the corner of his mouth. "You appear tobe thinking of anything but your lessons, young gentlemen--but as it isthe last day of school, I excuse you. We will have recess earlier thanusual, and see if we cannot do better afterward."So saying, he opened the door leading from the school room to hisprivate study, and went in; while the boys, luncheon in hand, ran to theplayground."The playground," as it was called, was the large yard attached to thehouse, which had been fitted up with a few simple gymnasticcontrivances, and formed a capital place where the boys might amusethemselves in fine weather. Down they sat, and for a few moments were sobusy trying who could take the biggest semicircular bite out of a sliceof bread and butter that nobody spoke a word. At last Freddy commenced,by calling out,"I say, fellows!""Silence in the guard tent! the Colonel's going to speak!" cried Peter,making a new version of the old school saying."Don't you know all the real Zouaves have their hair cut as short asanything? and just look at mine!" and Freddy tossed back his silky,golden curls in high disgust."Fellows, _it must be done_! We must have that hair off, short order!"continued the Colonel, solemnly."Well," exclaimed George Chadwick, who was the oldest of the party, andwould certainly have been Colonel if Freddy had not been prime favoritewith everybody, "Don't you see how we can manage that?""Why, how?" was the general question."Just you wait a moment," replied the inventor, and he put for the housein double quick time, whence he presently returned with an immense pairof scissors, which he had borrowed of the cook."Now, then, who'll be scissorized first?""I! I! I!" cried a chorus of voices."Can't do every one at once; come, Freddy, you're thecommander-in-chief, suppose you set the example.""Here goes, then!" exclaimed Freddy; and down he sat on the springboard.Snip! went the long scissors, and off came a beautiful curl. Snap! moredemolition on the other side, and in five minutes such a worn-out oldscrubbing brush as his head looked like, never was seen anywhere, evenon a Zouave; George, of course, running out his tongue so far atevery snip of the scissors, that it was a mercy it didn't get cut off,too.[Illustration: "FIRE AWAY OLD CHAP!"]"Jolly! what a fright you look!" shouted Peter. "I say Freddy, I expectyou'll scare General Beauregard into the cholera the first time he seesyou. Now, then, it's my turn; fire away old chap!"My conscience! what hair cutting that was! Some parts were scratchednearly bald, while in others, little bunches of hair were left standingup like stubble in an autumn cornfield. Their heads looked as if theyhad been gnawed by the mice or dug up in spots by the roots; and I amsure their own mammas would scarcely have known them again."Come, number three's turn now!" exclaimed George, flourishing hisscissors."No, I don't know about that," put in Tom Pringle, who was the mostthoughtful of the party, "I guess I'd rather see what my mother thinksbefore I have _my_ hair cut off."This speech caused the rest of the regiment to think of something whichhadn't struck them before, namely what _their_ mothers would say on thesubject of Zouave hair dressing, and as George began to be a littlefrightened by this time, at the fearful and astonishing results of hispatent plan, it was decided to defer the rest of the operation untilanother time.But the amazement of Dr. Larned, when he beheld his pupils in such acondition, was beyond everything."Why, Peter! Freddy! what have you been doing?" he exclaimed, raisinghis hands, and pushing his spectacles to the top of his forehead, tolook at them better."Oh, only getting our hair cut in the Zouave pattern," said Peter, ascool as a cucumber. "Don't you know, Doctor, that we've organized aregiment?""Organized a regiment!" repeated the doctor, his spectacles almostfalling off with astonishment."Yes, sir, the Dashahed Zouaves; haven't you heard of them?""Is there any end to the mischief of boys?" exclaimed the doctor; "Ifsuch things had happened in my young days, our old master, Dr.Birchemwell, would have verified his name even oftener than he did. I donot know what your mothers will say when they see such a couple ofscarecrows; but come, we have wasted quite time enough; lessons!lessons!"And to the credit of the boys, be it said, they really did set to worklike good fellows, recited the unlucky geography lesson without a singlemistake, ciphered like perfect calculating machines, and had thepleasure of hearing Dr. Larned say, as they shook hands for good-bye,"Really, young gentlemen, you have done very well--very well, indeed; sonow good-bye, and pleasant holidays!"CHAPTER II."MARCHING ALONG."MONDAY morning at last! and a bright, beautiful day. The sky was as blueas possible; the sun shone so brightly that it seemed as though it musthave been polished up for the occasion, and Colonel Freddy, as soon ashe awoke, could not help giving a little shout of joy.But what was that right opposite his bed? A large wooden box, with"Colonel Jourdain, Dashahed Zouaves, First Regiment L. I. Volunteers,"painted on the lid in great black letters.Up jumped the new Colonel quicker than any grasshopper, rushed to themysterious box, and raised the lid. Lying on top was a letter at leastsix inches square, directed like the box, and closed with a great redseal. Underneath _that_ was--what do you think? A splendid uniform for aColonel of Zouaves! sword, cap, and epaulettes, complete!Freddy's eyes and mouth opened to their widest compass, as he stared atthe box, too much surprised to move. Presently his father came in,looking highly amused."Good morning, Colonel," he began."Oh, father!" interrupted Freddy, finding his tongue at last, "do lookhere! Did you ever see anything so splendid in your life? Where _did_they come from?""Perhaps the letter will tell you," was all his father would say.Freddy snatched up the big letter, broke the seal, and with sparklingeyes read the following.                               NEW YORK, _July --th, 1861_.          MY DEAR SON:          In consideration of your heroic determination to          enter the army in the service of your country, and          seeing how nobly you have prepared to engage in          the contest by making your hair look as if it had          been driven in or pulled out, I have thought best          to present you with this uniform to whip the          Southerners in; a suit of which I have also sent          to every _man_ in your regiment. As I entertain          scarcely a doubt that Old Abe will shortly summon          you to start down South to Dixie, I hope that you          will have a brave regiment, a pleasant encampment,          and a first-rate time. And that, in later years,          should it be necessary, you will _truly_          distinguish yourself, through God's assistance,          under the banner of our country, and stand up in          the field in the cause of Truth and Justice, is          the sincere wish of                    Your affectionate Father,                                           L. JOURDAIN.Freddy was delighted at this letter, with its mingled playfulness andsincere patriotism. With all his fun, he was uncommonly intelligent, andunderstood and appreciated many things which far older boys might havefailed to comprehend; and now his splendid blue eyes were raised to hisfather's face, flashing with real enthusiasm; he felt and looked at thatmoment, like his noble French ancestors, a born soldier.But the serious mood was soon displaced by a fresh access of glee."Oh, thank you, papa!" he cried, "how very kind of you! How surprisedthe boys will be! Hurrah! what a jolly time we shall have! and do youthink the President will really send for us? He will be a perfectjay-bird of a President if he does!""No doubt he will be highly desirous to secure the services of thegallant Dashahed Zouaves," replied his father, laughing; "but make hastenow, Fred, it's nearly breakfast time." So saying, he left the room.Of course, the new clothes had to go on directly; and first my youngsoldier donned a pair of remarkably baggy red trowsers, which looked asif they had a connection with the Manhattan Gas Company like a new sortof balloon, they were so puffy; and a pair of leather gaiters reachingfrom the calf of the leg to the ancle. Then came a most splendidbluejacket, covered in every direction with gold lace, a killing littleruffled shirt, and a flourishing blue sash. Perched on top of his head,where his hair had been the day before, was a red fez with a long bluetassel, and, to crown all, or, I might say, _cutting-out_ everythingelse, was a splendid sword, as bright as silver, with a terriblysharp-looking edge, and an elegant gold handle.When he was all dressed, he ran down stairs and found, on entering thedining room, that he was the only one there. A large mirror was over themantel, which reflected the handsome room, with its deep bay window,filled with flowers, its sideboard, loaded with massive plate, and thebreakfast table, covered with its snowy cloth, and nice beefsteak,muffins, and coffee, looking so tempting to hungry folks.Freddy's eye fell on the mirror, and a new idea came into his head."Hurrah! here's a capital chance to see how I look from head to foot,"he thought; so, without remembering the long pier glasses in the parlor,he dragged his father's arm chair in front of the fireplace, and,jumping on the seat, stood turning and twisting about, staring athimself all the time, and quite put out at not being able to see thewhole of his back at once. Finally he concluded his performance bystriking a tremendous attitude, with his legs as far apart as the chairwould permit, his sword in the air, and such a ferocious scowl on hisface, that it was a mercy his brows didn't get tied up in a double bowknot then and there.All at once there was a little laugh in the direction of the door.Freddy wheeled round, and there were papa, mamma, and Bella looking on,and trying hard to keep in the laughter!Down scrambled Colonel Freddy from his perch, blushing up to the veryroots of his hair. There wasn't much more than the roots left, to besure; but his father laid his hand on the epauletted shoulder with agood-natured, "Never mind, old fellow, you look fine enough to justify alittle personal reflection."Hardly had Freddy taken his place at the table, and his father asked ablessing, than there came such a tremendous ring at the bell, that theythought the President must have come to town to see the regiment off onits travels; but, instead of Old Abe, Major Peter Schermerhorn (whopassed the week with an aunt in town, and only went down to Astoria onSaturdays) popped into the room. He was dressed, like Freddy, in a brannew Zouave suit, and the very first thing he said was, "Oh, Fred! onlysee what I found in my room this morning;" and Peter stood on one leg,and twirled round to show off his new clothes."So did I in mine!" said Freddy."Where could they have come from?" continued Peter. "I asked AuntEdith, and all she would tell me was that the box was sent last night,from a friend. Have you any idea, Fred?"Freddy burst out laughing. "They came from a good fairy," he said, "andthere he is!" and he pointed to his father, who pretended not to hear."Hurrah for Mr. Jourdain!" shouted Peter, tossing his cap in the air."Will you have some breakfast, Peter?" asked Mrs. Jourdain."Thank you, ma'am, I had my breakfast before I started, all alone bymyself--but," looking at the nice beefsteak, "I think I _could_ eat alittle more.""How many apples, by the way Peter?" asked Bella, mischievously."Only two," he answered, quite seriously, "and a piece of taffy, andtwo cents' worth of peanuts! that's all, I think; no, a cent's worth ofice cream!""Of ice cream!" exclaimed Bella, "where can you get ice cream for acent?""Why, on the street corners--real good ice cream, too--don't you knowthat?" and Peter put on an air of superior wisdom, as though he was aknowing young gentleman, who understood better than anybody where nicethings were to be had."But come, Peter," said Mr. Jourdain, "I should like to hear somethingmore about your encampment. How long is your father willing you shouldhave it?""Father says, sir," replied Peter, "that we can stay until he leaves forNiagara, which will be next week, I guess. We're to have our camp on thelawn, most a quarter of a mile from the house, and some of our men arefixing the tents this morning. There are to be eight of 'em--isn't thatgay, Fred? and we've got the smoke house by way of a guard tent beside;but there--I forgot all this time that I have a letter from papa foryou, sir--here it is."Mr. Jourdain opened the letter, and read as follows:          MY DEAR JOURDAIN:          I send you three words, through my harum-scarum          Peter, merely to beg that Mrs. Jourdain and          yourself will feel no uneasiness concerning the          military expedition which has been the principal          subject of discussion in my household, and I          presume in yours also, since Thursday last. The          invincible Zouaves will be stationed too near the          house to make any danger possible, and as my          family are going to Niagara on Tuesday, and I          shall be left a "lone lorn creetur," it will be as          much an amusement as anything to make their safety          and happiness my special care.          Hoping that you will permit Fred to remain in my          charge a few days, I am, with regards to Mrs.          Jourdain,                                Very sincerely yours,                                           H. SCHERMERHORN."Ting-a-ling-ling went the front door bell, as if the bull in Cock Robinhad hold of the handle. Tramp, tramp, shuffle, shuffle, in the hall, andthen Joseph tapped at the door, and showed in a whole troop of merry,noisy boys, all costumed ? la Zouave, and with their hair shaved soclose that they had to frown very hard to keep their caps on.The famous Dashahed Zouaves were all mustered, sure enough; and turnedout to consist of sixteen high privates, four captains, and astandard-bearer, master Tom Pringle, with a perfectly magnificentStar-spangled Banner in his hand, surmounted by an astonishing spreadeagle. Then came Major Peter Schermerhorn, who was the prime spirit ofmischief of the party, and last, though not least, the great ColonelFreddy; who was dancing about in a high state of glee; while the rest ofthe _men_, seeing that the _Colonel_ didn't regard dignity in the least,had an impromptu Zouave drill (which consists principally in turningsomersaults) all round the dining room, the grown people looking on, inagonies of suppressed laughter.While this novel entertainment was in full swing, the bell tingledagain, and Joseph entered once more, to announce, "Master Frederic, theescort and the band have _arriven_, and desire me to say that they areawaiting your pleasure."The escort and the band! Was there any end to wonders this morning? Atthose magical words, the regiment couldn't resist giving three cheersthat nearly took the top of the house off; followed by three for Mr.Jourdain, when Peter made a mock-heroic speech about the uniforms; andfinished off with a dozen more for anybody and everybody. At last Mr.Jourdain glanced at his watch and said, "Come, Colonel, I'm afraidyou'll miss the boat if you don't make haste. Remember, you have a longmarch before you, and it is almost ten o'clock now.""Ah, that's a fact!" exclaimed the commander. "Ahem! fall in, old chaps,that is, squad--battalion--what's his name; pshaw! and let's be off."This mandate to "fall in" certainly appeared to be translated "poke in"by the greater part of the corps, for it was directly followed by such atreading upon everybody's toes, and a ramming of elbows into otherpeople's stomachs and chests, and such imminent danger incurred of everyeye in the company being put out with bayonets held upside down,straight out, wiggle-waggle, and "various," as rendered it highly likelythat matters would be terminated by a fall _out_; but at last they werefairly in line, and marched down the steps into the street; feeling alittle shame-faced, but excessively proud of their new and conspicuousposition.All the neighbors were leaning out of windows, nearly petrified withastonishment at what was going on; while at least fifty little raggedboys stood staring at the door, their eyes almost popping out of theirheads, as the glorious Dashahed Zouaves made their appearance; tryingdesperately to tuck in the broad grins that _would_ show at the cornersof their mouths, and disturb the proper gravity of a soldier.But their good behavior was nearly put to flight altogether when theybeheld, waiting to escort them, three of the tallest policemen in thecity (to engage whom Mr. Jourdain had made that third call, youremember, in B---- street), and Dodworth's splendid brass band,marshalled in full force.Oh! how their eyes did sparkle! They could hardly get into marchingorder, or wait until Freddy, who had lingered behind to say good-by,came out and took his place at the head of the regiment. Then, with onemore tremendous cheer, rang out the command,MARCH!Out burst the band with the glorious "Star-spangled Banner;" brightlystreamed the folds of the flag itself in the wind; proudly ColonelFreddy waved his sword in the air; and so, with steps that kept time tothe music, and hearts that thrilled with a mixture of fun andpatriotism, the gallant Dashahed Zouaves marched off for CampMcClellan.CHAPTER III.CAMP LIFE.TOOT-TOOO! went the whistle of the steamboat "Mattano." "All aboard!"yelled the captain, and all aboard it was for the Dashahed Zouaves, andever so many people beside, who, you may be sure, were all eyes whenthey found out that such a _killing_ regiment was going down with them."Good-by, my boy," called Mr. Jourdain (who had followed the march in astage) from the wharf."Good-by, father; I say, old Beauregard will have to keep his eyes opennow the Dashahed Zouaves are in the field!" and Freddy waved his cap inone hand and his sword in the other to his father, as long as he couldsee him.In a few moments the boat was fairly out from the wharf, and the wholeregiment comfortably seated on the promenade deck; very proud of theirnew responsibilities as members of the army and society generally, andsurrounded by a crowd of admirers."Jolly, ain't I hungry!" exclaimed Freddy, as he joined them; "I wentoff with hardly any breakfast, I declare! wasn't that noble?""Noble? I don't see it!" said Charley Spicer. "Nobody asked you to gowithout your breakfast!""Why, wasn't I in a hurry to serve my country? When I was so full ofglory, I couldn't stop to get full of beefsteak and coffee beside!""Never mind!" cried Harry Livingston, "I have some sandwiches in myknapsack, and you shall have some, Fred.""Have you? there's six big apples in mine," said Charley."Here's a quart of peanuts and half a pound of taffy for my share,"added Jimmy Boorman."And I've a pair of broiled spring chickens! high diddle-diddle!"shouted George."Good boy!" exclaimed Tom Pringle; "here, take my molasses and waterbottle--canteen, I mean, and pass round the tin plate for the Colonel!"Amid high glee, every one bestowed a part of his provisions on Freddyuntil a sufficiently motley meal was collected; half of which heimmediately offered again to his companions, who, of course, were quiteready to feel hungry too, and they all munched together, like a companyof gypsies."I say, Capting," said a tall Yankee in a fur hat, to Peter, "what mayyew calculate dewing on Long Island?""Why, we're going into camp, to be sure.""Lors-a-massy! them air boys all alone by theirselves!" exclaimed anold countrywoman, carrying a large market basket, and wearing a greatpair of brass-rimmed spectacles. "It beats all natur!""Yew ha'n't got no one to look arter you?" continued the tall Yankee."Certainly; here's our commanding officer, Col. Jourdain.""Let me present Mr. ----," added Freddy, full of laugh, and highlyenjoying the fun."Captin George Washington Kosciusko Peter Bonaparte Solomon Hopkins!"said the countryman, with an awkward bow; while the boys hardly dared tolook at each other, they were so afraid of bursting out laughing at hisridiculous name. Its fortunate possessor, nothing abashed, went on,"But dew tell, wha--at on airth _dew_ you call yourselves?""These, sir," replied Freddy, as grave as a judge, though his eyessparkled with fun, "are the famous Dashahed Zouaves, First Regiment LongIsland Volunteers; I am the Colonel, this is Major Schermerhorn,Captains Spicer, Chadwick, Livingston, and Boorman, Sergeant Pringle,and Adjutant Costar.""Oh, _light infantry_ regiment, I calculate.""No, sir, _heavy veterans_!" put in Will Costar."Wal I never!" exclaimed Captin George Washington Kosciusko PeterBonaparte Solomon Hopkins (here the boat touched the pier of theFlushing Railroad); "Naow mind, Kurnel Jordan, if ever your regimentcomes to Hempstead, yeou put for Captin Hopkins' farm, and if yeou don'tget the biggest lot of red apples yeou ever _did_ see, I'll be made intoapple pie myself!" and off marched the Yankee, while the boys, as soonas he was fairly out of sight, indulged rather ungratefully in anexplosion of laughter.Presently the boat stopped at Ravenswood, and here the old woman gotoff; but before she went, she took an immense shiny hunk of gingerbreadout of the great market basket, and bestowed it on Freddy, saying,"Here, take this, sonny; you air a dear little fellow, so like mySammy, too"--and the poor old woman's voice broke, and tears began togather under the brass-bound spectacles, as she turned to leave theboat.Freddy put down his cake, and ran after her, saying, "Thank you, ma'am,thank you very much; I am sorry you are distressed."The old woman stopped, and saying softly, "Bless you, my son!" shekissed the bright, rosy cheek, and went away quite comforted.Freddy wasn't ashamed either, not a bit, when they teased him afterward,but said, "I don't care, she's a real nice old thing; now, there!"Soon the boat ran up to the wharf at Astoria. Delighted to arrive attheir journey's end, the boys scampered off as soon as the plank touchedthe shore, and "formed" on the road in fine style."Goodness, Peter!" exclaimed Freddy, "I hope it's not very far to yourfather's place; I'm afraid I shall be melted altogether if it is.""Well, it _is_ a good way," began Peter, with rather a rueful face."So far that I intend to take you there in comfort," said a pleasantvoice close behind them."Oh, father," cried Peter (for it was Mr. Schermerhorn), "how kind ofyou! Only look, boys!" and he pointed to two double rockaways which werewaiting on the pier.In they all swarmed, managing to find places for everybody (and really,it is surprising how a rockaway can _stretch_ on occasion), and after arapid drive along a level sandy road, the ha-ha fences of Mr.Schermerhorn's splendid country seat, "Locust Grove," came in view. Soonthe carriages entered the beautiful rustic gate, its pillars surmountedby vases, filled with trailing plants; and in a moment more were dashingover the gravelled drive toward the western side of the place.At one point, the road led directly over a deep ravine, spanned by abridge of rough logs. Then they whirled past a tranquil lake, dottedwith pond lilies, and shaded by drooping willows, through which might becaught a glimpse of the tall white chimneys of the house. At last, witha sudden bend, the drive came out on a wide velvet lawn, relieved by afringe of the beautiful locusts, covered, at this season of the year,with the fragrant pinkish flowers. At some distance a quaint Chinesesummer house served as an observatory; beds of brilliant scarlet verbenaand many-colored petunias dotted the grass here and there, and rightbefore them, most beautiful of all in their eyes, was the encampmentitself, eight snowy white tents, four in a row, while in the midst rosea tall flagstaff, with the dear old Red, White, and Blue floating fromthe summit."Hurrah, boys, there's the tents!" shouted Peter, at the top of hisvoice "Come, let's see who'll get there first;" and, before thecarriage could stop, Peter had hopped out, tumbled head over heels onthe soft grass, jumped up, and scampered on in advance, followed amoment after by the rest.These wonderful tents were furnished just like real soldiers' dwellings;with a good warm blanket for each of the three occupants, a bright tinbasin and tooth mug, a cedar bucket to draw water, a square lookingglass, like a sticking plaster, and a couple of wooden lockers (which,between ourselves, were made of claret boxes) in each one; beside campstools in abundance for everybody."Here's the officers' quarters!" cried George, as he flung open thedoor of the smoke house."No, that's the guard house, Chadwick," said Harry, "where we put therefracti-rac-tic-tactories.""Oh, is it? I go in for that!" shouted Will Costar, "whateverreractitactories may be.""You're on the wrong tack now, old chap," added Tom Pringle. "But onlysee what I've discovered! such a high old battery, boys! six brasscannon nearly as big as boot-jacks. Hurrah for the Dashahed Zouaves!"and away scampered the boys to look at the guns, while Colonel Freddy,quite forgetting his dignity, fell to and executed a volunteer Jim Crowpolka, and Peter sang the following ridiculous song, making up words ashe went along:          "Ain't I glad I'm out in the wilderness,                Out in the wilderness,                Out in the wilderness,           Ain't I glad I'm out in the wilderness,           Down in Astori-_or_?          "Good-by, boys, I'm off for Dixie,                Off for Dixie,                Off for Dixie,           Good-by, boys, I'm off for Dixie,           And sha'n't come back no more!"Meanwhile, Mr. Schermerhorn had been superintending certain arrangementsfor the provisioning of the camp, and presently a bugle call, sounded byone of the stable men, summoned the regiment to prepare for dinner.Peter took a bucket and went to draw some water; George and Harry made afire in the smoke house, which, after all the guesses, turned out to beintended for the regimental kitchen; Jimmy and Tom were initiated intothe mysteries of frying ham and potatoes by the cook, and the rest setthe table (for the soldiers considered it a point of honor that theyshould wait on themselves).Amid high glee the table, consisting of a broad smooth plank placed uponhorses, was laid with the tin cup and plates, the pewter forks andspoons, and horn-handled knives, which the boys carried in theirknapsacks just like real soldiers, after which the table was furtherembellished by the remains of the rations they had brought with them,disposed around wherever they thought the dishes would have the besteffect.The grand feast of fried ham was ready at last, and the new cookspresented themselves and it at table, very hungry and happy. Mrs.Mincemeat, the fat cook, had made the boys each put on one of her bluecheck aprons, tied under their chins, to save their uniforms; and whenthey appeared in this new array, their faces as red and shining as astick of sealing wax, there was a general shout of laughter."Well, my precious babies," cried one."Don't soil your new bibs, my tiddy-ikle duckies!" called another."There, don't tease them," said Freddy, the general peacemaker; "Come,fellows, let's have dinner; ham's good, I tell you!" and down they satat table, in high, good humor.Of course the cooking business was rather to amuse the boys than inearnest, for the fried ham formed only a small part of the abundantdinner set before the gallant Zouaves. There was lamb, and green peas,new potatoes, fresh tomatoes, custard pudding, and raspberries, all ofwhich was pronounced "fine," although Jimmy declared there never was anydish at Delmonico's to equal or surpass his fried ham, and the othersfully concurred in this opinion.As soon as the dinner was fairly under way, Mr. Schermerhorn rose fromhis place at the table, where he had been carving, and said, with apleased smile on his face, "Now, my brave soldiers, I must take myleave. Have the goodness not to do double-quick over the flower beds,leave a dish or so of cherries in the orchard, and, whatever you do,don't tumble into the lake, and I shall be satisfied.""Three cheers for Mr. Schermerhorn!" shouted Colonel Freddy. In aninstant every fellow was on his feet, every cap was in the air, and atremendous "Hurrah! hurrah! ti-ga-a-ah!" made the echoes around CampMcClellan wake up in a hurry, and poke their heads out of the hills tosee where the cannonading was.Of course, being boys, the regiment cleared the dishes in astonishingstyle, and polished their plates so thoroughly that you would hardlyhave thought they wanted the grand washing they had when dinner wasover.After stowing all the things away neatly in the smokehouse, andarranging their surplus luggage (which had been sent down the previousSaturday), in the lockers, they all had a grand game at fox and geese,which lasted until Freddy, perfectly worn out with laughing andscampering about, exclaimed, "Come, fellows, do let's sit down and bequiet; I'm as tired as if I had walked from here to China.""Yes, let's be _solemn_ a little while," said Peter. "In these_momentous_ times, we _army men_ ought to be thinking how to fix off theold secessionists and that sort of thing. I move we all sit down in acircle, and the first who laughs shall tell a story."The boys thought this was a grand idea. So they found a nice place, justbeneath the sheltering boughs of the locusts, and, putting the campstools in a ring, they sat down, to see how solemn they could be. But itwas no use; though they pinched up their mouths, and frowned, and didtheir best to look like a company of highly respectable owls, in twominutes they all burst out laughing, so nearly together that nobodycould tell who had begun.As soon as the broad faces had come back to their proper length, therewas a general cry for a story; and as Peter had instituted the newregulation, he undertook to carry it out; so, drawing a long breath tostart with, he commenced:"Once upon a time, there lived a family of bears in a thick wood.Grumpy-growly, the father, was a jolly, cross old fellow--oh! I guess hewas! and the little ones didn't dare so much as to snap at a fly withoutpermission, when he was around."One day Grumpy-growly went out to take a walk, bidding the young onesto be very good while he was away; for he was a widower, poor fellow!and had to see after his family himself."As soon as he was fairly gone, Longclawse, the eldest, said, 'Seems tome, brothers, we have stood this long enough. All the other cubs in thewood can run about as they please, and why should we be kept in thispoky old cave? Suppose we try to get away the big log before the door?'for this was what Grumpy-growly put up to keep them at home."'Good! I go in for that!' cried Bushyball, Titehugge, and Stubtail, theother cubs."So first they tried to poke their noses under the log, but the plaguyold thing wouldn't stir. Then they turned their backs against it, andall kicked together with their hind legs, and presently away it went, tothe great delight of the four bears, who didn't trouble themselves toput it back again, but just packed up their carpet bags, and cut stick,I tell you."Here Peter opened his eyes and mouth very wide, and ran out his tonguefor a moment to get an airing, a proceeding which he frequently repeatedduring the story. Then he went on:"They had a jolly time climbing trees, rolling on the soft grass, andplaying with the other bears they met; but at last Titehugge andStubtail, the youngest, declared they were too tired to go another step,and must take a little nap. Longclawse and Bushyball thought they wouldgo off to see the election, which they had been told was to take placethat very day, and the others, promising not to stir from the spotwithout them, curled themselves up into tight round balls, and went tosleep."While they were dreaming away, a fox came along. He was a cunning oldcodger, and hated Grumpy-growly like mustard, because the old fellow hadonce treated him, in a fit of rage, to a hug that nearly put an end tohim. When he saw the sons of his enemy asleep, he made up his mind tofool them in revenge; and after he had rummaged both their carpet bags,to see if there was anything worth taking, he went up to Titehugge andpulled his ear a little to waken him. Titehugge, who was as cross astwo sticks, and always fighting his brothers, opened his eyes, and fora moment looked so very like giving the fox a gentle squeeze, that foxywas rather startled. However, he took courage, and laying his paw on hisheart, he made the bear such an elegant bow that he nearly cracked hisspine. 'Ah, my d-e-a-r Titehugge! so glad to see you. You know I havealways been a great friend of your dear papa's, and now, I should beoverjoyed to do you a little favor. Do you happen to know that there isa tree near here, which is hollow from root to branches, and filled withwild bees' combs and honey?'"'No! cried Titehugge, 'is there? Show it to me directly, master fox,and don't stand there gaping at me!' You see, bears were nevercelebrated for being polite, and Titehugge had no more manners than anyof 'em."'Come along, then,' said the fox, 'but take care to make no noise, oryou will waken your brother, and then he'll be wanting to have half thehoney.'"Titehugge was a selfish little pig--bear, I mean--and though he feltrather shy of going off alone for the first time in his life, he was toogreedy after the honey to let that trouble him much. However, he said,'You had better be careful not to play any tricks, master fox, for ifyou do, I'll give you a hug that will settle _you_--if you are such adear friend of mine.'"'My d-e-a-r friend!' exclaimed the fox, 'd-o-n't say so! How can yousuppose I would do such a shabby thing? Come, we shall soon be at thetree.'"Titehugge waited for nothing more, but started off with master fox, whokept on flattering him all the way until Titehugge thought him thefirst-_ratest_ fellow in the whole world. Presently they came to thehollow tree, and Titehugge, without waiting to ask any questions,shinned up like a streak of lightning, and began smelling down the hole.'But, it looks very dark down here,' cried he at last 'and I don't seeany honey'."'Oh, you must poke your nose further in,' said the fox, 'and you'llsoon come to it.'"Titehugge accordingly rammed and jammed his head with great difficultyinto the hole, which proved such an uncommonly tight fit, that, notfinding any honey, he began trying to pull it back double quick; but loand behold! pull and tug, scratch and swear as he might, he was caughtin a mouse trap not intended for bears, while the fox stood belowgiggling. After he had amused himself enough with Titehugge's struggles,he scampered off to find Stubtail; bawling out, 'Good-by, my d-e-a-rfriend, I hope you'll find the honey answer your expectations.'"Meanwhile, master Stubtail was snoring away like a catamount, when thefox trotted up, and seating himself beside him, began to sing a popularfox ballad, beginning, 'Oh? don't I love to cheat 'em!'"This soon awoke Stubtail, and opening his eyes, he saw the fox sitting,singing away, as if he never dreamed of such a person as Stubtail beingnear."'Well, master fox!' he said, in a dandified way, 'whawt business haveyou, I should like to know, in the--aw company of a bearah of fashion?Make your mannahs, sir, and don't sit down before your bettahs! Howhorrid vulgah you are--aw!'"Up jumped the fox, and made such a beautiful bow this time, that hefell over on his nose, and nearly stuck his tail in the bear's face, ashe exclaimed, 'Oh, my d-e-a-r friend! d-o-n'-t say that! I didn't meanto be uncivil. I only came to ask you to a little fox party that iscoming off this afternoon, if your highness will favor us with yourhonorable company. Only ten of my cousins and seven of my brothers andsisters are coming--just a nice little family party; but then they areall such beauties! particularly my cousin, Miss Slygo Brighteyes! She isperfectly lovely; as slender as a bean pole, and smooth as a youngrabbit; and then such sharp teeth, such a fine bushy tail! oh my! and_such_ a dancer, too, as she is!'"Now, Stubtail was as fond of dancing and flirting as his brother ofeating, and tried to be a great dandy and beau; so when master fox gavesuch a glowing description of Miss Slygo Brighteyes, his charmingcousin, Stubtail's whiskers curled up tighter than ever; and he couldhardly manage to _drawl_ out, 'Aw--yaas, I think I _will_ dwop in forharf an 'ouah!'"When the fox heard that, he was ready to stand on his head for joy; andcould scarcely wait while Stubtail opened his carpet bag, and took outhis all-rounder collar, his lemon-colored kid gloves, and his pork piehat, to wear at the fox's party."But what has become of Titehugge?' he asked, suddenly noticing that hisbrother was not there."'Oh, never mind _him_,' said the fox, 'I saw the selfish little wretchgobbling away at some honey as I came along, and you see he was toogreedy to ask you to share it.'"This was enough for Stubtail, who was too hard at work drawing on histight gloves to think of anything else, and away he trotted with thefox; who took him to a lonely hollow in the wood, where, sure enough,there were about fifty other foxes clustered together, but who looked atStubtail as he came among them, in anything but a pleasant manner."'Now, my friends!' exclaimed master fox himself, in a furious tone,'you see before you the son of that old scoundrel Grumpy-growly, whonearly killed me last year. At him, my dear cousins! scratch his eyesout! ahaaa!' and with a long growl of rage the fox made a sudden jump atpoor Stubtail before he had time to run away, followed by all theothers."Stubtail fought like a perfect Zouave, hugging, scratching, and bitinghis enemies with might and main; but after all, one poor little cubcould not do very much against a whole army of foxes, and Stubtail wouldhave been killed outright before long, when suddenly a tremendousgrowling was heard! and up dashed Grumpy-growly himself, who mostfortunately happened to be passing, and came to see what the row was,followed by Longclawse and Bushyball, full tilt! They didn't stop toinquire whether this was a free fight or not, but pitched in like athousand of bricks, and demolished the foxes in a way which astonishedthem considerable."As to master fox, he was making off first of anybody, leaving hisfriends in the lurch; but Grumpy-growly saw him, and catching him by theear, made him confess all the mischief he had been about that morning;and as soon as he had finished, Grumpy-growly gave him one good hug,which killed him as dead as a coffin nail."After the grand battle was over, Grumpy-growly marshalled the threecubs before him, hanging their heads, and looking perfectly miserablewith shame and fatigue, and started off to find Titehugge; scolding andbeating them all the way for their naughty conduct, though they werepunished enough already; for Longclawse and Bushyball had gone to theelection, where they had been well pummelled by a shoulder-hittingbaboon, because they insisted on voting for Douglas as the beariestfellow on the ticket, and afterward met by their father, who gave themanother thrashing for daring to come out without leave, and dragged themhowling away. Stubtails ears were torn into ribbons, his head bleedingin twenty places, and unfortunately no 'Balm of the Blooming Blossoms ofGilead' to put on it, and, in short, the whole party looked as if theyhad been at an Irish funeral and nearly been made 'cold corpuses'themselves. After a long hunt, they at last found Titehugge stuck fastwhere the fox had left him, and now the puzzle was to get him out. Thethree brothers all tried in vain, and at last Grumpy-growly caught holdof Titehugge's tail, Longclawse of Grumpy-growly's, Stubtail ofLongclawse's, and Bushyball of Stubtail's, and they all pulled andtugged together; ouf! ouf! altogether now! one, two, three, Pop! outcame Titehugge, and out came his tail, too! and the five bears rolledhead over heels together in such a hurley-burley, that it was a longtime before they could get straight enough to start for home; and whenthey _did_ get there, Grumpy-growly put up the big log again, and put abig stone on top of that, and a hundred pound weight on top of that, and_one_ of those home-made pies we used to have at boarding school on topof _that_, which proved the heaviest of the lot, and if they everhappened to get out of prison again, it is more than I know."Thus ended the wonderful story of the five bears, which gave greatamusement to the hearers, and was pronounced "first rate." Pretty soonafter, they had a scrambling sort of tea, not quite as orderly asdinner, for they were all tired out with the day's adventures; and aboutseven o'clock, George, who, as I told you, was the oldest of the party,sensibly proposed that the regiment should go "early to bed," on theprinciple of the old maxim, and in order to be "early to rise," afterthe example of real soldiers.As they were not quite certain what were the usual ceremonies attendantupon soldiers' retiring, Freddy undertook to "do the thing up brown," ashe said, in a novel and delightfully military manner. So, taking hisplace about a dozen yards in advance of the camp, and standing as stiffas a ramrod, just as he had seen the officers do at West Point, hecalled out "Battalion, attention!"At these words, the regiment strung themselves in a long line, like somany kibobs on a straw, with their captains standing in front. "Now,Captain Livingston, dismiss your company to quarters," and off marchedthe first company, four "men" strong, toward the tents; then the nextfour, and so on, until all had gone, and then came posting back againwithout the smallest delay.Colonel Freddy was obediently following his own orders by dismissinghimself, with a sublime disregard of rank, when Peter suddenly calledout, "I say, Fred, there's one thing you've forgotten!""What is that?" asked Freddy, stopping short."Why, we ought to have a guard. You know they always do in camps.""To be sure! I never thought of that. Come, fellows, the safety of CampMcClellan must be looked out for.""Very well, suppose you begin!" laughed Jimmy."Hum, I'm the Colonel; Colonels can't be sentinels.""But I want to go to bed!" objected Will Costar."Well, I love my country, but I think the country had better turn intoo!" said Harry. "What business has the country to be awake and gettinginto mischief in the middle of the night?""Voted," cried Peter, "that the guard be mounted, but that it shall goto bed as soon as it gets sleepy!""Good for you! that's the way to fix it!" said Colonel Freddy. "Nowthen, boys, who'll turn out?" and two of the gallant Zouaves beingposted, one on each side of the camp, the others produced theirnightgowns (which, by their special entreaty, had been crammed into thelittle knapsacks), and with several hair breadth escapes from having oneor two of the tents pitched over, as the occupants incautiously ranagainst the poles, the regiment after, I am glad to say, a most sincereand earnest repetition of their prayers, fell into the sweet sound sleepof happy childhood; while the guard, after prancing up and down aboutten minutes, concluded to follow their example, as there was nothingparticular in the way of an enemy to look out for.Ah! how charming looked now the little encampment, with the fullradiance of the harvest moon streaming over the white tents, standinggleamingly out from the dark background of trees. No sound but thechirpings of insects could be heard; nothing moved about the spot butthe flag, stirring dreamily in the summer breeze. And now the windsprings fresher up; it catches the bright folds, and they flash out infull view. God bless you, glorious old banner! floating there over asloyal, though boyish hearts, as ever beat in the midnight camp of theArmy of Freedom.                           END OF VOL.

FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS*Ver.04.29.93*END*The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Damnation of Theron Wareby Harold FredericPART ICHAPTER INo such throng had ever before been seen in the buildingduring all its eight years of existence.  People werewedged together most uncomfortably upon the seats;they stood packed in the aisles and overflowed the galleries;at the back, in the shadows underneath these galleries,they formed broad, dense masses about the doors,through which it would be hopeless to attempt a passage.The light, given out from numerous tin-lined circlesof flaring gas-jets arranged on the ceiling,fell full upon a thousand uplifted faces--some framedin bonnets or juvenile curls, others bearded or crownedwith shining baldness--but all alike under the spellof a dominant emotion which held features in abstractedsuspense and focussed every eye upon a common objective point.The excitement of expectancy reigned upon each rowof countenances, was visible in every attitude--nay, seemed a part of the close, overheated atmosphere itself.An observer, looking over these compact lines of facesand noting the uniform concentration of eagernessthey exhibited, might have guessed that they were watchingfor either the jury's verdict in some peculiarly absorbingcriminal trial, or the announcement of the lucky numbersin a great lottery.  These two expressions seemedto alternate, and even to mingle vaguely, upon theupturned lineaments of the waiting throng--the hopeof some unnamed stroke of fortune and the dread of some adverse decree.But a glance forward at the object of this universalgaze would have sufficed to shatter both hypotheses. Here was neither a court of justice nor a tombola. It was instead the closing session of the annualNedahma Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,and the Bishop was about to read out the listof ministerial appointments for the coming year. This list was evidently written in a hand strange to him,and the slow, near-sighted old gentleman, having at lastsufficiently rubbed the glasses of his spectacles, and thenadjusted them over his nose with annoying deliberation,was now silently rehearsing his task to himself--the while the clergymen round about ground their teethand restlessly shuffled their feet in impatience.Upon a closer inspection of the assemblage, there were agreat many of these clergymen.  A dozen or more dignified,and for the most part elderly, brethren sat groupedabout the Bishop in the pulpit.  As many others,not quite so staid in mien, and indeed with here and therealmost a suggestion of frivolity in their postures,were seated on the steps leading down from this platform. A score of their fellows sat facing the audience, on chairstightly wedged into the space railed off round the pulpit;and then came five or six rows of pews, stretching acrossthe whole breadth of the church, and almost solidly filledwith preachers of the Word.There were very old men among these--bent and decrepitveterans who had known Lorenzo Dow, and had been ordainedby elders who remembered Francis Asbury and even Whitefield. They sat now in front places, leaning forward with tremblingand misshapen hands behind their hairy ears, waiting tohear their names read out on the superannuated list,it might be for the last time.The sight of these venerable Fathers in Israel was goodto the eyes, conjuring up, as it did, pictures of a timewhen a plain and homely people had been served by a ferventand devoted clergy--by preachers who lacked in learningand polish, no doubt, but who gave their lives without dreamof earthly reward to poverty and to the danger and wearing toilof itinerant missions through the rude frontier settlements. These pictures had for their primitive accessories log-huts,rough household implements, coarse clothes, and patchedold saddles which told of weary years of journeying;but to even the least sympathetic vision there shoneupon them the glorified light of the Cross and Crown. Reverend survivors of the heroic times, their verypresence there--sitting meekly at the altar-rail to hearagain the published record of their uselessness and of theirdependence upon church charity--was in the nature of a benediction.The large majority of those surrounding these patriarchswere middle-aged men, generally of a robust type,with burly shoulders, and bushing beards framing shavenupper lips, and who looked for the most part like honestand prosperous farmers attired in their Sunday clothes. As exceptions to this rule, there were scattered strayspecimens of a more urban class, worthies with neatlytrimmed whiskers, white neckcloths, and even indicationsof hair-oil--all eloquent of citified charges; and now andagain the eye singled out a striking and scholarly face,at once strong and simple, and instinctively referred itto the faculty of one of the several theological seminariesbelonging to the Conference.The effect of these faces as a whole was toward goodness,candor, and imperturbable self-complacency rather thanlearning or mental astuteness; and curiously enough it woreits pleasantest aspect on the countenances of the older men. The impress of zeal and moral worth seemed to diminishby regular gradations as one passed to younger faces;and among the very beginners, who had been ordained only withinthe past day or two, this decline was peculiarly marked. It was almost a relief to note the relative smallnessof their number, so plainly was it to be seen that theywere not the men their forbears had been.And if those aged, worn-out preachers facing the pulpithad gazed instead backward over the congregation,it may be that here too their old eyes would have detecteda difference--what at least they would have deemed a decline.But nothing was further from the minds of the members of theFirst M. E. Church of Tecumseh than the suggestion that theywere not an improvement on those who had gone before them. They were undoubtedly the smartest and most importantcongregation within the limits of the Nedahma Conference,and this new church edifice of theirs represented alikea scale of outlay and a standard of progressive tastein devotional architecture unique in the Methodism of thatwhole section of the State.  They had a right to be proudof themselves, too.  They belonged to the substantialorder of the community, with perhaps not so many very richmen as the Presbyterians had, but on the other handwith far fewer extremely poor folk than the Baptistswere encumbered with.  The pews in the first four rowsof their church rented for one hundred dollars apiece--quite up to the Presbyterian highwater mark--and theynow had almost abolished free pews altogether.  The oystersuppers given by their Ladies' Aid Society in the basementof the church during the winter had established rankamong the fashionable events in Tecumseh's social calendar.A comprehensive and satisfied perception of these advantageswas uppermost in the minds of this local audience,as they waited for the Bishop to begin his reading. They had entertained this Bishop and his Presiding Elders,and the rank and file of common preachers, in a stylewhich could not have been remotely approached by anyother congregation in the Conference.  Where else,one would like to know, could the Bishop have been domiciledin a Methodist house where he might have a sitting-roomall to himself, with his bedroom leading out of it? Every clergyman present had been provided for in aprivate residence--even down to the Licensed Exhorters,who were not really ministers at all when you came to thinkof it, and who might well thank their stars that theConference had assembled among such open-handed people. There existed a dim feeling that these Licensed Exhorters--an uncouth crew, with country store-keepers and lumbermenand even a horse-doctor among their number--had takenrather too much for granted, and were not exhibiting quitethe proper degree of gratitude over their reception.But a more important issue hung now imminent in the balance--was Tecumseh to be fairly and honorably rewarded for herhospitality by being given the pastor of her choice?All were agreed--at least among those who paid pew-rents--upon the great importance of a change in the pulpitof the First M. E. Church.  A change in persons mustof course take place, for their present pastor hadexhausted the three-year maximum of the itinerant system,but there was needed much more than that.  For a handsomeand expensive church building like this, and with sucha modern and go-ahead congregation, it was simply a vitalnecessity to secure an attractive and fashionable preacher. They had held their own against the Presbyteriansthese past few years only by the most strenuous efforts,and under the depressing disadvantage of a ministerwho preached dreary out-of-date sermons, and who lackedeven the most rudimentary sense of social distinctions. The Presbyterians had captured the new cashier of theAdams County Bank, who had always gone to the MethodistChurch in the town he came from, but now was lostsolely because of this tiresome old fossil of theirs;and there were numerous other instances of the same sort,scarcely less grievous.  That this state of things mustbe altered was clear.The unusually large local attendance upon the sessionsof the Conference had given some of the more guilelessof visiting brethren a high notion of Tecumseh's piety;and perhaps even the most sophisticated stranger neverquite realized how strictly it was to be explained by theanxiety to pick out a suitable champion for the fiercePresbyterian competition.  Big gatherings assembled eveningafter evening to hear the sermons of those selected to preach,and the church had been almost impossibly crowded at each ofthe three Sunday services.  Opinions had naturally differeda good deal during the earlier stages of this scrutiny,but after last night's sermon there could be but one feeling. The man for Tecumseh was the Reverend Theron Ware.The choice was an admirable one, from points of view muchmore exalted than those of the local congregation.You could see Mr. Ware sitting there at the end of therow inside the altar-rail--the tall, slender youngman with the broad white brow, thoughtful eyes,and features moulded into that regularity of strengthwhich used to characterize the American Senatorial typein those far-away days of clean-shaven faces and moderateincomes before the War.  The bright-faced, comely,and vivacious young woman in the second side pew washis wife--and Tecumseh noted with approbation that sheknew how to dress.  There were really no two better orworthier people in the building than this young couple,who sat waiting along with the rest to hear their fate. But unhappily they had come to know of the effort beingmade to bring them to Tecumseh; and their simple pridein the triumph of the husband's fine sermon had becomeswallowed up in a terribly anxious conflict of hopeand fear.  Neither of them could maintain a satisfactoryshow of composure as the decisive moment approached. The vision of translation from poverty and obscurityto such a splendid post as this--truly it was too dazzlingfor tranquil nerves.The tedious Bishop had at last begun to call his rollof names, and the good people of Tecumseh mentallyticked them off, one by one, as the list expanded. They felt that it was like this Bishop--an unimportantand commonplace figure in Methodism, not to be mentionedin the same breath with Simpson and Janes and Kingsley--that he should begin with the backwoods counties,and thrust all these remote and pitifully rustic stationsahead of their own metropolitan charge.  To these theylistened but listlessly--indifferent alike to the joyand to the dismay which he was scattering among the divinesbefore him.The announcements were being doled out with stumbling hesitation. After each one a little half-rustling movement throughthe crowded rows of clergymen passed mute judgment uponthe cruel blow this brother had received, the reward justlygiven to this other, the favoritism by which a thirdhad profited.  The Presiding Elders, whose work all this was,stared with gloomy and impersonal abstraction down uponthe rows of blackcoated humanity spread before them. The ministers returned this fixed and perfunctory gazewith pale, set faces, only feebly masking the emotionswhich each new name stirred somewhere among them. The Bishop droned on laboriously, mispronouncing wordsand repeating himself as if he were reading a catalogueof unfamiliar seeds."First church of Tecumseh--Brother Abram G. Tisdale!"There was no doubt about it!  These were actually thewords that had been uttered.  After all this outlay,all this lavish hospitality, all this sacrifice of timeand patience in sitting through those sermons, to drawfrom the grab-bag nothing better than--a Tisdale!A hum of outraged astonishment--half groan, half wrathfulsnort bounded along from pew to pew throughout the bodyof the church.  An echo of it reached the Bishop, and soconfused him that he haltingly repeated the obnoxious line. Every local eye turned as by intuition to where thecalamitous Tisdale sat, and fastened malignantly upon him.Could anything be worse?  This Brother Tisdale was past fifty--a spindling, rickety, gaunt old man, with a long horse-likehead and vacantly solemn face, who kept one or theother of his hands continually fumbling his bony jaw. He had been withdrawn from routine service for a numberof years, doing a little insurance canvassing on hisown account, and also travelling for the Book Concern. Now that he wished to return to parochial work, the richestprize in the whole list, Tecumseh, was given to him--to him who had never been asked to preach at a Conference,and whose archaic nasal singing of "Greenland's IcyMountains " had made even the Licensed Exhorters grin! It was too intolerably dreadful to think of!An embittered whisper to the effect that Tisdale wasthe Bishop's cousin ran round from pew to pew.  This didnot happen to be true, but indignant Tecumseh gave itentire credit.  The throngs about the doors dwindled asby magic, and the aisles cleared.  Local interest was dead;and even some of the pewholders rose and made their way out. One of these murmured audibly to his neighbors as hedeparted that HIS pew could be had now for sixty dollars.So it happened that when, a little later on,the appointment of Theron Ware to Octavius was read out,none of the people of Tecumseh either noted or cared. They had been deeply interested in him so long as it seemedlikely that he was to come to them--before their clearlyexpressed desire for him had been so monstrously ignored. But now what became of him was no earthly concern of theirs.After the Doxology had been sung and the Conferenceformally declared ended, the Wares would fain have escapedfrom the flood of handshakings and boisterous farewellswhich spread over the front part of the church.  But theclergymen were unusually insistent upon demonstrations ofcordiality among themselves--the more, perhaps, because itwas evident that the friendliness of their local hostshad suddenly evaporated--and, of all men in the world,the present incumbent of the Octavius pulpit now boredown upon them with noisy effusiveness, and defied evasion."Brother Ware--we have never been interduced--but letme clasp your hand!  And--Sister Ware, I presume--yours too!"He was a portly man, who held his head back so that hisface seemed all jowl and mouth and sandy chin-whisker.He smiled broadly upon them with half-closed eyes,and shook hands again."I said to 'em," he went on with loud pretence of heartiness,"the minute I heerd your name called out for ourdear Octavius, "I must go over an' interduce myself." It will be a heavy cross to part with those dear people,Brother Ware, but if anything could wean me to the notion,so to speak, it would be the knowledge that you are to takeup my labors in their midst.  Perhaps--ah--perhaps theyARE jest a trifle close in money matters, but they comeout strong on revivals.  They'll need a good deal o'stirrin' up about parsonage expenses, but, oh! suchseasons of grace as we've experienced there together!" He shook his head, and closed his eyes altogether,as if transported by his memories.Brother Ware smiled faintly in decorous response,and bowed in silence; but his wife resented the unctuousbeaming of content on the other's wide countenance,and could not restrain her tongue."You seem to bear up tolerably well under this heavy cross,as you call it," she said sharply."The will o' the Lord, Sister Ware--the will o' the Lord!"he responded, disposed for the instant to put on hispompous manner with her, and then deciding to smile againas he moved off.  The circumstance that he was to getan additional three hundred dollars yearly in his newplace was not mentioned between them.By a mutual impulse the young couple, when they had at lastgained the cool open air, crossed the street to the sidewhere over-hanging trees shaded the infrequent lamps,and they might be comparatively alone.  The wife hadtaken her husband's arm, and pressed closely upon itas they walked.  For a time no word passed, but finallyhe said, in a grave voice,--"It is hard upon you, poor girl."Then she stopped short, buried her face against his shoulder,and fell to sobbing.He strove with gentle, whispered remonstrance to winher from this mood, and after a few moments she liftedher head and they resumed their walk, she wiping her eyesas they went."I couldn't keep it in a minute longer!" she said,catching her breath between phrases.  "Oh, WHY do theybehave so badly to us, Theron?"He smiled down momentarily upon her as they moved along,and patted her hand."Somebody must have the poor places, Alice," he said consolingly. "I am a young man yet, remember.  We must take our turn,and be patient.  For 'we know that all things work together for good.'""And your sermon was so head-and-shoulders above allthe others!" she went on breathlessly.  "Everybody said so! And Mrs. Parshall heard it so DIRECT that you were tobe sent here, and I know she told everybody how much Iwas lotting on it--I wish we could go right off tonightwithout going to her house--I shall be ashamed to lookher in the face--and of course she knows we're pokedoff to that miserable Octavius.--Why, Theron, they tellme it's a worse place even than we've got now!""Oh, not at all," he put in reassuringly.  "It hasgrown to be a large town--oh, quite twice the sizeof Tyre.  It's a great Irish place, I've heard. Our own church seems to be a good deal run down there. We must build it up again; and the salary is better--a little."But he too was depressed, and they walked on toward theirtemporary lodging in a silence full of mutual grief. It was not until they had come within sight of this goalthat he prefaced by a little sigh of resignation thesefurther words,--"Come--let us make the best of it, my girl!  After all,we are in the hands of the Lord.""Oh, don't, Theron!" she said hastily.  "Don't talk to meabout the Lord tonight; I can't bear it!"CHAPTER II"Theron!  Come out here!  This is the funniest thing wehave heard yet!"Mrs. Ware stood on the platform of her new kitchen stoop. The bright flood of May-morning sunshine completely envelopedher girlish form, clad in a simple, fresh-starched calico gown,and shone in golden patches upon her light-brown hair. She had a smile on her face, as she looked down at the milkboy standing on the bottom step--a smile of a doubtful sort,stormily mirthful."Come out a minute, Theron!" she called again;and in obedience to the summons the tall lank figureof her husband appeared in the open doorway behind her. A long loose, open dressing-gown dangled to his knees,and his sallow, clean-shaven, thoughtful face wore a morningundress expression of youthful good-nature. He leanedagainst the door-sill, crossed his large carpet slippers,and looked up into the sky, drawing a long satisfied breath."What a beautiful morning!" he exclaimed.  "The elmsover there are full of robins.  We must get up earlierthese mornings, and take some walks."His wife indicated the boy with the milk-pail on his arm,by a wave of her hand."Guess what he tells me!" she said.  "It wasn't a mistakeat all, our getting no milk yesterday or the Sunday before. It seems that that's the custom here, at least so faras the parsonage is concerned.""What's the matter, boy?" asked the young minister,drawling his words a little, and putting a sense of placidirony into them.  "Don't the cows give milk on Sunday, then?"The boy was not going to be chaffed.  "Oh, I'll bring youmilk fast enough on Sundays, if you give me the word,"he said with nonchalance.  "Only it won't last long.""How do you mean--'won't last long'?", asked Mrs. Ware, briskly.The boy liked her--both for herself, and for the doughnutsfried with her own hands, which she gave him on hismorning round.  He dropped his half-defiant tone."The thing of it's this," he explained.  "Every newminister starts in saying we can deliver to this houseon Sundays, an' then gives us notice to stop beforethe month's out.  It's the trustees that does it."The Rev. Theron Ware uncrossed his feet and moved out onto the stoop beside his wife.  "What's that you say?"he interjected.  "Don't THEY take milk on Sundays?""Nope!" answered the boy.The young couple looked each other in the facefor a puzzled moment, then broke into a laugh."Well, we'll try it, anyway," said the preacher. "You can go on bringing it Sundays till--till--""Till you cave in an' tell me to stop," put in the boy. "All right!" and he was off on the instant, the dipperjangling loud incredulity in his pail as he went.The Wares exchanged another glance as he disappearedround the corner of the house, and another mutual laughseemed imminent.  Then the wife's face clouded over,and she thrust her under-lip a trifle forward out of itsplace in the straight and gently firm profile."It's just what Wendell Phillips said," she declared. "'The Puritan's idea of hell is a place where everybody hasto mind his own business.'"The young minister stroked his chin thoughtfully, and lethis gaze wander over the backyard in silence.  The gardenparts had not been spaded up, but lay, a useless stretchof muddy earth, broken only by last year's cabbage-stumpsand the general litter of dead roots and vegetation. The door of the tenantless chicken-coop hung wide open. Before it was a great heap of ashes and cinders, soaked intogrimy hardness by the recent spring rains, and nearer stillan ancient chopping-block, round which were scattered oldweather-beaten hardwood knots which had defied the axe,parts of broken barrels and packing-boxes, and a namelessdebris of tin cans, clam-shells, and general rubbish. It was pleasanter to lift the eyes, and look acrossthe neighbors' fences to the green, waving tops of the elmson the street beyond.  How lofty and beautiful they werein the morning sunlight, and with what matchless charmcame the song of the robins, freshly installed in theirhaunts among the new pale-green leaves!  Above them,in the fresh, scented air, glowed the great blue dome,radiant with light and the purification of spring.Theron lifted his thin, long-fingered hand, and passed itin a slow arch of movement to comprehend this gloriousupper picture."What matter anyone's ideas of hell," he said, in soft,grave tones, "when we have that to look at, and listen to,and fill our lungs with?  It seems to me that we never FEELquite so sure of God's goodness at other times as we doin these wonderful new mornings of spring."The wife followed his gesture, and her eyes rested fora brief moment, with pleased interest, upon the treesand the sky.  Then they reverted, with a harsher scrutiny,to the immediate foreground."Those Van Sizers ought to be downright ashamed of themselves,"she said, "to leave everything in such a muss as this. You MUST see about getting a man to clean up the yard,Theron.  It's no use your thinking of doing it yourself. In the first place, it wouldn't look quite the thing,and, second, you'd never get at it in all your born days. Or if a man would cost too much, we might get a boy. I daresay Harvey would come around, after he'd finishedwith his milk-route in the forenoon.  We could give himhis dinner, you know, and I'd bake him some cookies. He's got the greatest sweet-tooth you ever heard of. And then perhaps if we gave him a quarter, or say half a dollar,he'd be quite satisfied.  I'll speak to him in the morning. We can save a dollar or so that way.""I suppose every little does help," commented Mr. Ware,with a doleful lack of conviction.  Then his face brightened. "I tell you what let's do!" he exclaimed.  "Get on yourstreet dress, and we'll take a long walk, way out intothe country.  You've never seen the basin, where theyfloat the log-rafts in, or the big sawmills.  The hillsbeyond give you almost mountain effects, they are so steep;and they say there's a sulphur spring among the slateon the hill-side, somewhere, with trees all about it;and we could take some sandwiches with us--""You forget," put in Mrs. Ware,--"those trustees arecoming at eleven.""So they are!" assented the young minister, with somethinglike a sigh.  He cast another reluctant, lingering glanceat the sunlit elm boughs, and, turning, went indoors.He loitered for an aimless minute in the kitchen,where his wife, her sleeves rolled to the elbow,now resumed the interrupted washing of the breakfast dishes--perhaps with vague visions of that ever-receding timeto come when they might have a hired girl to do such work. Then he wandered off into the room beyond, which servedthem alike as living-room and study, and let his eye runalong the two rows of books that constituted his library. He saw nothing which he wanted to read.  Finally he didtake down "Paley's Evidences," and seated himself in thebig armchair--that costly and oversized anomaly amonghis humble house-hold gods; but the book lay unopened onhis knee, and his eyelids half closed themselves in signof revery.This was his third charge--this Octavius which theyboth knew they were going to dislike so much.The first had been in the pleasant dairy and hop countrymany miles to the south, on another watershed and amonga different kind of people.  Perhaps, in truth, the grindinglabor, the poverty of ideas, the systematic selfishnessof later rural experience, had not been lacking there;but they played no part in the memories which now hepassed in tender review.  He recalled instead the warmsunshine on the fertile expanse of fields; the sleek,well-fed herds of "milkers" coming lowing down the roadunder the maples; the prosperous and hospitable farmhouses,with their orchards in blossom and their spacious red barns;the bountiful boiled dinners which cheery housewivesserved up with their own skilled hands.  Of course,he admitted to himself, it would not be the same if hewere to go back there again.  He was conscious of havingmoved along--was it, after all, an advance?--to a pointwhere it was unpleasant to sit at table with the unfragranthired man, and still worse to encounter the bucolicconfusion between the functions of knives and forks. But in those happy days--young, zealous, himself farm-bred--these trifles had been invisible to him, and life thereamong those kindly husbandmen had seemed, by contrastwith the gaunt surroundings and gloomy rule of thetheological seminary, luxuriously abundant and free.It was there too that the crowning blessedness ofhis youth--nay, should he not say of all his days?--had come to him.  There he had first seen Alice Hastings,--the bright-eyed, frank-faced, serenely self-reliant girl,who now, less than four years thereafter, could be heardwashing the dishes out in the parsonage kitchen.How wonderful she had seemed to him then!  How beautifuland all-beneficent the miracle still appeared! Though herself the daughter of a farmer, her presenceon a visit within the borders of his remote countrycharge had seemed to make everything, there a hundredtimes more countrified than it had ever been before. She was fresh from the refinements of a town seminary: she read books; it was known that she could play uponthe piano.  Her clothes, her manners, her way of speaking,the readiness of her thoughts and sprightly tongue--not least, perhaps, the imposing current understandingas to her father's wealth--placed her on a glorifiedpinnacle far away from the girls of the neighborhood. These honest and good-hearted creatures indeed calledceaseless attention to her superiority by their deferenceand open-mouthed admiration, and treated it as the mostnatural thing in the world that their young minister should bevisibly "taken" with her.Theron Ware, in truth, left this first pastorate of histhe following spring, in a transfiguring halo of romance. His new appointment was to Tyre--a somewhat distantvillage of traditional local pride and substance--and hewas to be married only a day or so before entering uponhis pastoral duties there.  The good people among whom hehad begun his ministry took kindly credit to themselvesthat he had met his bride while she was "visiting round"their countryside.  In part by jocose inquiries addressedto the expectant groom, in part by the confidences of thepostmaster at the corners concerning the bulk and frequencyof the correspondence passing between Theron and the nowremote Alice--they had followed the progress of the courtshipthrough the autumn and winter with friendly zest. When he returned from the Conference, to say good-byeand confess the happiness that awaited him, they gavehim a "donation"--quite as if he were a married pastorwith a home of his own, instead of a shy young bachelor,who received his guests and their contributions in thehouse where he boarded.He went away with tears of mingled regret and proud joyin his eyes, thinking a good deal upon their predictionsof a distinguished career before him, feeling infinitelystrengthened and upborne by the hearty fervor of theirGod-speed, and taking with him nearly two wagon-loadsof vegetables, apples, canned preserves, assorted furniture,glass dishes, cheeses, pieced bedquilts, honey, feathers,and kitchen utensils.Of the three years' term in Tyre, it was pleasantestto dwell upon the beginning.The young couple--after being married out at Alice's homein an adjoining county, under the depressing conditionsof a hopelessly bedridden mother, and a father and brotherswhose perceptions were obviously closed to the advantagesof a matrimonial connection with Methodism--came straight tothe house which their new congregation rented as a parsonage. The impulse of reaction from the rather grim cheerlessnessof their wedding lent fresh gayety to their lighthearted,whimsical start at housekeeping.  They had never laughedso much in all their lives as they did now in thesefirst months--over their weird ignorance of domestic details;with its mishaps, mistakes, and entertaining discoveries;over the comical super-abundances and shortcomingsof their "donation" outfit; over the thousand and onequaint experiences of their novel relation to each other,to the congregation, and to the world of Tyre at large.Theron, indeed, might be said never to have laughed before. Up to that time no friendly student of his character,cataloguing his admirable qualities, would have thoughtof including among them a sense of humor, much less a benttoward levity.  Neither his early strenuous battle to getaway from the farm and achieve such education as shouldserve to open to him the gates of professional life,nor the later wave of religious enthusiasm which caughthim up as he stood on the border-land of manhood,and swept him off into a veritable new world of viewsand aspirations, had been a likely school of merriment. People had prized him for his innocent candor andguileless mind, for his good heart, his pious zeal,his modesty about gifts notably above the average,but it had occurred to none to suspect in him a latentfunny side.But who could be solemn where Alice was?--Alice in aquandary over the complications of her cooking stove;Alice boiling her potatoes all day, and her eggs for halfan hour; Alice ordering twenty pounds of steak and halfa pound of sugar, and striving to extract a breakfastbeverage from the unground coffee-bean? Clearly notso tenderly fond and sympathetic a husband as Theron. He began by laughing because she laughed, and grewby swift stages to comprehend, then frankly to share,her amusement.  From this it seemed only a step to thedevelopment of a humor of his own, doubling, as it were,their sportive resources.  He found himself discoveringa new droll aspect in men and things; his phraseology tookon a dryly playful form, fittingly to present conceitswhich danced up, unabashed, quite into the presenceof lofty and majestic truths.  He got from this nothingbut satisfaction; it obviously involved increased claimsto popularity among his parishioners, and consequentlymagnified powers of usefulness, and it made life so much morea joy and a thing to be thankful for.  Often, in the midstof the exchange of merry quip and whimsical suggestion,bright blossoms on that tree of strength and knowledgewhich he felt expanding now with a mighty outward pushingin all directions, he would lapse into deep gravity,and ponder with a swelling heart the vast unspeakable marvelof his blessedness, in being thus enriched and humanizedby daily communion with the most worshipful of womankind.This happy and good young couple took the affections ofTyre by storm.  The Methodist Church there had at no timeheld its head very high among the denominations, and forsome years back had been in a deplorably sinking state,owing first to the secession of the Free Methodistsand then to the incumbency of a pastor who scandalizedthe community by marrying a black man to a white woman. But the Wares changed all this.  Within a month the reportof Theron's charm and force in the pulpit was crowdingthe church building to its utmost capacity--and that,too, with some of Tyre's best people.  Equally winningwas the atmosphere of jollity and juvenile high spiritswhich pervaded the parsonage under these new conditions,and which Theron and Alice seemed to diffuse whereverthey went.Thus swimmingly their first year sped, amid universal acclaim. Mrs. Ware had a recognized social place, quite outsidethe restricted limits of Methodism, and shone in it withan unflagging brilliancy altogether beyond the traditionsof Tyre.  Delightful as she was in other people's houses,she was still more naively fascinating in her own quaintand somewhat harum-scarum domicile; and the drab,two-storied, tin-roofed little parsonage might well haverattled its clapboards to see if it was not in dreamland--so gay was the company, so light were the hearts,which it sheltered in these new days.  As for Theron,the period was one of incredible fructification and output. He scarcely recognized for his own the mind which now wasreaching out on all sides with the arms of an octopus,exploring unsuspected mines of thought, bringing inrich treasures of deduction, assimilating, building,propounding as if by some force quite independent of him. He could not look without blinking timidity at the radianceof the path stretched out before him, leading upwardto dazzling heights of greatness.At the end of this first year the Wares suddenly discoveredthat they were eight hundred dollars in debt.The second year was spent in arriving, by slow stages andwith a cruel wealth of pathetic detail, at a realizationof what being eight hundred dollars in debt meant.It was not in their elastic and buoyant natures to graspthe full significance of the thing at once, or easily. Their position in the social structure, too, was allagainst clear-sightedness in material matters. A general, for example, uniformed and in the saddle,advancing through the streets with his staff in the proudwake of his division's massed walls of bayonets, cannot beimagined as quailing at the glance thrown at him by histailor on the sidewalk.  Similarly, a man invested withsacerdotal authority, who baptizes, marries, and buries,who delivers judgments from the pulpit which may not bequestioned in his hearing, and who receives from all hisfellow-men a special deference of manner and speech,is in the nature of things prone to see the grocer'sbook and the butcher's bill through the little endof the telescope.The Wares at the outset had thought it right to tradeas exclusively as possible with members of their ownchurch society.  This loyalty became a principal elementof martyrdom.  Theron had his creditors seated in serriedrows before him, Sunday after Sunday.  Alice had hercritics consolidated among those whom it was her chief dutyto visit and profess friendship for.  These situationsnow began, by regular gradations, to unfold their terrors. At the first intimation of discontent, the Wares madewhat seemed to them a sweeping reduction in expenditure. When they heard that Brother Potter had spoken of themas "poor pay," they dismissed their hired girl. A little later, Theron brought himself to drop a laboriouslycasual suggestion as to a possible increase of salary,and saw with sinking spirits the faces of the stewardsfreeze with dumb disapprobation.  Then Alice paid a visitto her parents, only to find her brothers doggedlyhostile to the notion of her being helped, and her fatherso much under their influence that the paltry sum hedared offer barely covered the expenses of her journey. With another turn of the screw, they sold the piano shehad brought with her from home, and cut themselves downto the bare necessities of life, neither receiving companynor going out.  They never laughed now, and even smilesgrew rare.By this time Theron's sermons, preached under that stonyglare of people to whom he owed money, had degeneratedto a pitiful level of commonplace.  As a consequence,the attendance became once more confined to the insufficientmembership of the church, and the trustees complainedof grievously diminished receipts.  When the Wares,grown desperate, ventured upon the experiment of tradingoutside the bounds of the congregation, the trusteescomplained again, this time peremptorily.Thus the second year dragged itself miserably to an end. Nor was relief possible, because the Presiding Elder knewsomething of the circumstances, and felt it his dutyto send Theron back for a third year, to pay his debts,and drain the cup of disciplinary medicine to its dregs.The worst has been told.  Beginning in utter blackness,this third year, in the second month, brought a change as welcomeas it was unlooked for.  An elderly and important citizenof Tyre, by name Abram Beekman, whom Theron knew slightly,and had on occasions seen sitting in one of the backpews near the door, called one morning at the parsonage,and electrified its inhabitants by expressing a desireto wipe off all their old scores for them, and give thema fresh start in life.  As he put the suggestion, they couldfind no excuse for rejecting it.  He had watched them,and heard a good deal about them, and took a fatherly sortof interest in them.  He did not deprecate their regardingthe aid he proffered them in the nature of a loan,but they were to make themselves perfectly easy about it,and never return it at all unless they could spare itsometime with entire convenience, and felt that they wantedto do so.  As this amazing windfall finally took shape,it enabled the Wares to live respectably through the year,and to leave Tyre with something over one hundred dollarsin hand.It enabled them, too, to revive in a chastened form theirold dream of ultimate success and distinction for Theron. He had demonstrated clearly enough to himself, during thatbrief season of unrestrained effulgence, that he had withinhim the making of a great pulpit orator.  He set to work now,with resolute purpose, to puzzle out and master all theprinciples which underlie this art, and all the tricksthat adorn its superstructure.  He studied it, fastened histhoughts upon it, talked daily with Alice about it. In the pulpit, addressing those people who had so darkenedhis life and crushed the first happiness out of his home,he withheld himself from any oratorical display whichcould afford them gratification.  He put aside, as well;the thought of attracting once more the non-Methodistsof Tyre, whose early enthusiasm had spread such pitfallsfor his unwary feet.  He practised effects now by piecemeal,with an alert ear, and calculation in every tone. An ambition, at once embittered and tearfully solicitous,possessed him.He reflected now, this morning, with a certain incredulousinterest, upon that unworthy epoch in his life history,which seemed so far behind him, and yet had come to a closeonly a few weeks ago.  The opportunity had been given him,there at the Tecumseh Conference, to reveal his quality. He had risen to its full limit of possibilities,and preached a great sermon in a manner which he at leastknew was unapproachable.  He had made his most powerfulbid for the prize place, had trebly deserved success--and had been banished instead to Octavius!The curious thing was that he did not resent his failure. Alice had taken it hard, but he himself was conscious of asense of spiritual gain.  The influence of the Conference,with its songs and seasons of prayer and high pressureof emotional excitement, was still strong upon him. It seemed years and years since the religious side of himhad been so stirred into motion.  He felt, as he layback in the chair, and folded his hands over the bookon his knee, that he had indeed come forth from the firepurified and strengthened.  The ministry to souls diseasedbeckoned him with a new and urgent significance.  He smiledto remember that Mr. Beekman, speaking in his shrewd andpointed way, had asked him whether, looking it all over,he didn't think it would be better for him to study law,with a view to sliding out of the ministry when a goodchance offered.  It amazed him now to recall that he hadtaken this hint seriously, and even gone to the lengthof finding out what books law-students began upon.Thank God! all that was past and gone now.  The Call sounded,resonant and imperative, in his ears, and there was noimpulse of his heart, no fibre of his being, which didnot stir in devout response.  He closed his eyes, to bethe more wholly alone with the Spirit, that moved him.The jangling of a bell in the hallway broke sharply uponhis meditations, and on the instant his wife thrustin her head from the kitchen."You'll have to go to the door, Theron!" she warned him,in a loud, swift whisper.  "I'm not fit to be seen. It is the trustees.""All right," he said, and rose slowly from sprawlingrecumbency to his feet.  "I'll go.""And don't forget," she added strenuously; "I believein Levi Gorringe!  I've seen him go past here with his rodand fish-basket twice in eight days, and that's a good sign. He's got a soft side somewhere.  And just keep a stiffupper lip about the gas, and don't you let them jew youdown a solitary cent on that sidewalk.""All right," said Theron, again, and moved reluctantlytoward the hall door.CHAPTER IIIWhen the three trustees had been shown in by the Rev. Mr. Ware,and had taken seats, an awkward little pause ensued. The young minister looked doubtingly from one faceto another, the while they glanced with inquiring interestabout the room, noting the pictures and appraisingthe furniture in their minds.The obvious leader of the party, Loren Pierce, a richquarryman, was an old man of medium size and mean attire,with a square, beardless face as hard and impassivein expression as one of his blocks of limestone. The irregular, thin-lipped mouth, slightly sunken,and shut with vice-like firmness, the short snub nose,and the little eyes squinting from half-closed lidsbeneath slightly marked brows, seemed scarcely to attainto the dignity of features, but evaded attention instead,as if feeling that they were only there at all fromplain necessity, and ought not to be taken into account. Mr. Pierce's face did not know how to smile--what was the useof smiles?--but its whole surface radiated secretiveness. Portrayed on canvas by a master brush, with a ruffor a red robe for masquerade, generations of imaginativeamateurs would have seen in it vast reaching plots,the skeletons of a dozen dynastic cupboards, the guardedmysteries of half a century's international diplomacy. The amateurs would have been wrong again.  There wasnothing behind Mr. Pierce's juiceless countenance moreweighty than a general determination to exact seven percent for his money, and some specific notions aboutcapturing certain brickyards which were interfering withhis quarry-sales. But Octavius watched him shamble alongits sidewalks quite as the Vienna of dead and forgottenyesterday might have watched Metternich.Erastus Winch was of a breezier sort--a florid, stout,and sandy man, who spent most of his life driving overevil country roads in a buggy, securing orders for dairyfurniture and certain allied lines of farm utensils. This practice had given him a loud voice and a deceptivelyhearty manner, to which the other avocation of cheese-buyer,which he pursued at the Board of Trade meetings everyMonday afternoon, had added a considerable command ofpersuasive yet non-committal language.  To look at him,still more to hear him, one would have sworn he was agood fellow, a trifle rough and noisy, perhaps, but allright at bottom.  But the County Clerk of Dearborn Countycould have told you of agriculturists who knew Erastusfrom long and unhappy experience, and who held him to beeven a tighter man than Loren Pierce in the matter of a mortgage.The third trustee, Levi Gorringe, set one wondering at thevery first glance what on earth he was doing in that company. Those who had known him longest had the least notion;but it may be added that no one knew him well. He was a lawyer, and had lived in Octavius for upwardsof ten years; that is to say, since early manhood. He had an office on the main street, just under theprincipal photograph gallery.  Doubtless he was sometimesin this office; but his fellow-townsmen saw him more oftenin the street doorway, with the stairs behind him, and theflaring show-cases of the photographer on either side,standing with his hands in his pockets and an unlightedcigar in his mouth, looking at nothing in particular. About every other day he went off after breakfastinto the country roundabout, sometimes with a rod,sometimes with a gun, but always alone.  He was a bachelor,and slept in a room at the back of his office, cooking someof his meals himself, getting others at a restaurantclose by.  Though he had little visible practice,he was understood to be well-to-do and even more,and people tacitly inferred that he "shaved notes." The Methodists of Octavius looked upon him as a queer fish,and through nearly a dozen years had never quite outgrowntheir hebdomadal tendency to surprise at seeing him entertheir church.  He had never, it is true, professed religion,but they had elected him as a trustee now for a numberof terms, all the same--partly because he was theironly lawyer, partly because he, like both his colleagues,held a mortgage on the church edifice and lot. In person, Mr. Gorringe was a slender man, with a skinof a clear, uniform citron tint, black waving hair,and dark gray eyes, and a thin, high-featured face. He wore a mustache and pointed chin-tuft; and, though hewas of New England parentage and had never been furthersouth than Ocean Grove, he presented a general effectof old Mississippian traditions and tastes startlingly atvariance with the standards of Dearborn County Methodism. Nothing could convince some of the elder sisters that he wasnot a drinking man.The three visitors had completed their survey of the room now;and Loren Pierce emitted a dry, harsh little cough, as asignal that business was about to begin.  At this sound,Winch drew up his feet, and Gorringe untied a parcelof account-books and papers that he held on his knee. Theron felt that his countenance must be exhibiting to theassembled brethren an unfortunate sense of helplessnessin their hands.  He tried to look more resolute,and forced his lips into a smile."Brother Gorringe allus acts as Seckertary,"said Erastus Winch, beaming broadly upon the minister,as if the mere mention of the fact promoted jollity. "That's it, Brother Gorringe,--take your seat at BrotherWare's desk.  Mind the Dominie's pen don't play trickson you, an' start off writin' out sermons instid of figgers." The humorist turned to Theron as the lawyer walked overto the desk at the window.  "I allus have to caution himabout that," he remarked with great joviality.  "An' do YOUlook out afterwards, Brother Ware, or else you'll catchthat pen o' yours scribblin' lawyer's lingo in place o'the Word."Theron felt bound to exhibit a grin in acknowledgmentof this pleasantry.  The lawyer's change of position hadinvolved some shifting of the others' chairs, and the youngminister found himself directly confronted by BrotherPierce's hard and colorless old visage.  Its little eyeswere watching him, as through a mask, and under theirinfluence the smile of politeness fled from his lips. The lawyer on his right, the cheese-buyer to the left,seemed to recede into distance as he for the moment returnedthe gaze of the quarryman.  He waited now for him to speak,as if the others were of no importance."We are a plain sort o' folks up in these parts,"said Brother Pierce, after a slight further pause. His voice was as dry and rasping as his cough, and itsintonations were those of authority.  "We walk here,"he went on, eying the minister with a sour regard,"in a meek an' humble spirit, in the straight an'narrow way which leadeth unto life.  We ain't gone traipsin'after strange gods, like some people that call themselvesMethodists in other places.  We stick by the Discipline an'the ways of our fathers in Israel.  No new-fangled notionscan go down here.  Your wife'd better take them flowersout of her bunnit afore next Sunday."Silence possessed the room for a few moments,the while Theron, pale-faced and with brows knit,studied the pattern of the ingrain carpet.  Then he liftedhis head, and nodded it in assent.  "Yes," he said;"we will do nothing by which our 'brother stumbleth,or is offended, or is made weak.'"Brother Pierce's parchment face showed no sign of surpriseor pleasure at this easy submission.  "Another thing: We don't want no book-learnin' or dictionary words inour pulpit," he went on coldly.  "Some folks may stomach'em; we won't. Them two sermons o' yours, p'r'aps they'ddo down in some city place; but they're like your wife'sbunnit here, they're too flowery to suit us.  What wewant to hear is the plain, old-fashioned Word of God,without any palaver or 'hems and ha's." They tell methere's some parts where hell's treated as played-out--where our ministers don't like to talk much about itbecause people don't want to hear about it.  Such preachersought to be put out.  They ain't Methodists at all. What we want here, sir, is straight-out, flat-footed hell--the burnin' lake o' fire an' brim-stone. Pour it into'em, hot an' strong.  We can't have too much of it. Work in them awful deathbeds of Voltaire an' Tom Paine,with the Devil right there in the room, reachin' for 'em, an'they yellin' for fright; that's what fills the anxious seat an'brings in souls hand over fist."Theron's tongue dallied for an instant with the temptationto comment upon these old-wife fables, which were so dearto the rural religious heart when he and I were boys. But it seemed wiser to only nod again, and let his mentorgo on."We ain't had no trouble with the Free Methodists here,"continued Brother Pierce, "jest because we kept to theold paths, an' seek for salvation in the good old way. Everybody can shout "Amen!" as loud and as long asthe Spirit moves him, with us.  Some one was sayin'you thought we ought to have a choir and an organ. No, sirree!  No such tom-foolery for us!  You'll only stirup feelin' agin yourself by hintin' at such things. And then, too, our folks don't take no stock in allthat pack o' nonsense about science, such as tellin'the age of the earth by crackin' up stones.  I've b'enin the quarry line all my life, an' I know it's all humbug! Why, they say some folks are goin' round now preachin'that our grandfathers were all monkeys.  That comesfrom departin' from the ways of our forefathers, an puttin'in organs an' choirs, an' deckin' our women-folks outwith gewgaws, an' apin' the fashions of the worldly. I shouldn't wonder if them kind did have some monkey bloodin 'em.  You'll find we're a different sort here."The young minister preserved silence for a little, until itbecame apparent that the old trustee had had his say out. Even then he raised his head slowly, and at last madeanswer in a hesitating and irresolute way"You have been very frank," he said.  "I am obliged to you. A clergyman coming to a new charge cannot be better servedthan by having laid before him a clear statement of theviews and--and spiritual tendencies--of his new flock,quite at the outset.  I feel it to be of especial valuein this case, because I am young in years and in my ministry,and am conscious of a great weakness of the flesh. I can see how daily contact with a people so attachedto the old, simple, primitive Methodism of Wesleyand Asbury may be a source of much strength to me. I may take it," he added upon second thought, with aninquiring glance at Mr. Winch, "that Brother Pierce'sdescription of our charge, and its tastes and needs,meets with your approval?"Erastus Winch nodded his head and smiled expansively. "Whatever Brother Pierce says, goes!" he declared. The lawyer, sitting behind at the desk by the window,said nothing."The place is jest overrun with Irish," Brother Piercebegan again.  "They've got two Catholic churches herenow to our one, and they do jest as they blamed pleaseat the Charter elections.  It'd be a good idee to pitchinto Catholics in general whenever you can.  You couldmake a hit that way.  I say the State ought to make 'empay taxes on their church property.  They've no rightto be exempted, because they ain't Christians at all. They're idolaters, that's what they are!  I know 'em! I've had 'em in my quarries for years, an' they ain't gotno idee of decency or fair dealin'. Every time the priceof stone went up, every man of 'em would jine to screwmore wages out o' me.  Why, they used to keep account o'the amount o' business I done, an' figger up my profits, an'have the face to come an' talk to me about 'em, as ifthat had anything to do with wages.  It's my belief theirpriests put 'em up to it.  People don't begin to reelize--that church of idolatry 'll be the ruin o' this country,if it ain't checked in time.  Jest you go at 'em hammer'n' tongs!  I've got Eyetalians in the quarries now. They're sensible fellows:  they know when they're well off--a dollar a day, an' they're satisfied, an' everything goessmooth.""But they're Catholics, the same as the Irish," suddenlyinterjected the lawyer, from his place by the window. Theron pricked up his ears at the sound of his voice. There was an anti-Pierce note in it, so to speak, which itdid him good to hear.  The consciousness of sympathybegan on the instant to inspire him with courage."I know some people SAY they are," Brother Pierceguardedly retorted "but I've summered an' wintered bothkinds, an' I hold to it they're different.  I grant ye,the Eyetalians ARE some given to jabbin' knives intoeach other, but they never git up strikes, an' they don'tgrumble about wages.  Why, look at the way they live--jest some weeds an' yarbs dug up on the roadside, an'stewed in a kettle with a piece o' fat the size o'your finger, an' a loaf o' bread, an' they're happy as a king. There's some sense in THAT; but the Irish, they've gotto have meat an' potatoes an' butter jest as if--as if--""As if they'd b'en used to 'em at home," put in Mr. Winch,to help his colleague out.The lawyer ostentatiously drew up his chair to the desk,and began turning over the leaves of his biggest book. "It's getting on toward noon, gentlemen," he said, in animpatient voice.The business meeting which followed was for a considerabletime confined to hearing extracts from the books and papersread in a swift and formal fashion by Mr. Gorringe. If this was intended to inform the new pastor of the exactfinancial situation in Octavius, it lamentably failedof its purpose.  Theron had little knowledge of figures;and though he tried hard to listen, and to assume an airof comprehension, he did not understand much of what he heard. In a general way he gathered that the church property wasput down at $12,000, on which there was a debt of $4,800.The annual expenses were $2,250, of which the principalitems were $800 for his salary, $170 for the rentof the parsonage, and $319 for interest on the debt. It seemed that last year the receipts had fallen just under$2,000, and they now confronted the necessity of makinggood this deficit during the coming year, as well asincreasing the regular revenues.  Without much discussion,it was agreed that they should endeavor to secure theservices of a celebrated "debt-raiser," early in the autumn,and utilize him in the closing days of a revival.Theron knew this "debt-raiser," and had seen him at work--a burly, bustling, vulgar man who took possessionof the pulpit as if it were an auctioneer's block,and pursued the task of exciting liberality in the bosomsof the congregation by alternating prayer, anecdote, song,and cheap buffoonery in a manner truly sickening. Would it not be preferable, he feebly suggested,to raise the money by a festival, or fair, or someother form of entertainment which the ladies could manage?Brother Pierce shook his head with contemptuous emphasis. "Our women-folks ain't that kind," he said.  "They did tryto hold a sociable once, but nobody came, and we didn'traise more 'n three or four dollars.  It ain't their line. They lack the worldly arts.  As the Discipline commands,they avoid the evil of putting on gold and costly apparel,and taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name ofthe Lord Jesus.""Well--of course--if you prefer the 'debt-raiser'--"Theron began, and took the itemized account from Gorringe'sknee as an excuse for not finishing the hateful sentence.He looked down the foolscap sheet, line by line,with no special sense of what it signified, until hiseye caught upon this little section of the report,bracketed by itself in the Secretary's neat hand:INTEREST CHARGE.First mortgage (1873) .. $1,000 ... (E. Winch)    @7.. $ 70Second mortgage (1776)..  1,700 ... (L. Gorringe) @6..  102Third mortgage (1878)...  2,100 ... (L. Pierce)   @7..  147                        -------                       -----                         $4,800                        $319It was no news to him that the three mortgages onthe church property were held by the three trustees. But as he looked once more, another feature of the thingstruck him as curious."I notice that the rates of interest vary," he remarkedwithout thinking, and then wished the words unsaid,for the two trustees in view moved uneasily on their seats."Oh, that's nothing," exclaimed Erastus Winch, with aboisterous display of jollity.  "It's only BrotherGorringe's pleasant little way of making a contributionto our funds.  You will notice that, at the dateof all these mortgages, the State rate of interest wasseven per cent.  Since then it's b'en lowered to six. Well, when that happened, you see, Brother Gorringe,not being a professin' member, and so not bound by our rules,he could just as well as not let his interest down a cent. But Brother Pierce an' me, we talked it over, an' we madeup our minds we were tied hand an' foot by our contract. You know how strong the Discipline lays it down thatwe must be bound to the letter of our agreements. That bein' so, we seen it in the light of duty not to changewhat we'd set our hands to.  That's how it is, Brother Ware.""I understand," said Theron, with an effort at politecalmness of tone.  "And--is there anything else?""There's this," broke in Brother Pierce:  "we're commandedto be law-abiding people, an' seven per cent WAS the law an'would be now if them ragamuffins in the Legislation--""Surely we needn't go further into that," interruptedthe minister, conscious of a growing stiffnessin his moral spine.  "Have we any other business before us?"Brother Pierce's little eyes snapped, and the wrinklesin his forehead deepened angrily.  "Business?" he demanded. "Yes, plenty of it.  We've got to reduce expenses. We're nigh onto $300 behind-hand this minute.  Besides yourhouse-rent, you get $800 free an' clear--that is $15.38every week, an' only you an' your wife to keep out of it. Why, when I was your age, young man, and after that too,I was glad to get $4 a week.""I don't think my salary is under discussion, Mr. Pierce--""BROTHER Pierce!" suggested Winch, in a half-shuckling undertone."Brother Pierce, then!" echoed Theron, impatiently. "The Quarterly Conference and the Estimating Committeedeal with that.  The trustees have no more to do with itthan the man in the moon.""Come, come, Brother Ware," put in Erastus Winch,"we mustn't have no hard feelin's. Brotherly love iswhat we're all lookin' after.  Brother Pierce's meanin'wasn't agin your drawin' your full salary, every centof it, only--only there are certain little things connectedwith the parsonage here that we feel you ought to bear. F'r instance, there's the new sidewalk we had to layin front of the house here only a month ago.  Of course,if the treasury was flush we wouldn't say a word about it. An' then there's the gas bill here.  Seein' as you getyour rent for nothin', it don't seem much to ask that youshould see to lightin' the place yourself.""No, I don't think that either is a proper charge upon me,"interposed Theron.  "I decline to pay them.""We can have the gas shut off," remarked Brother Pierce, coldly."As soon as you like," responded the minister, sitting erectand tapping the carpet nervously with his foot.  Only youmust understand that I will take the whole matter to theQuarterly Conference in July.  I already see a good manyother interesting questions about the financial managementof this church which might be appropriately discussed there.""Oh, come, Brother Ware!" broke in Trustee Winch, with asomewhat agitated assumption of good-feeling. "Surelythese are matters we ought to settle amongst ourselves. We never yet asked outsiders to meddle with our business here. It's our motto, Brother Ware.  I say, if you've got a motto,stand by it.""Well, my motto," said Theron, "is to be behaved decentlyto by those with whom I have to deal; and I also proposeto stand by it."Brother Pierce rose gingerly to his feet, with thehesitation of an old man not sure about his knees. When he had straightened himself, he put on his hat,and eyed the minister sternly from beneath its brim."The Lord gives us crosses grievous to our natur',"he said, "an' we're told to bear 'em cheerfully as longas they're on our backs; but there ain't nothin' said aginour unloadin' 'em in the ditch the minute we git the chance. I guess you won't last here more 'n a twelvemonth."He pulled his soft and discolored old hat down over hisbrows with a significantly hostile nod, and, turning,stumped toward the hall-door without offering to shake hands.The other trustees had risen likewise, in tacit recognitionthat the meeting was over.  Winch clasped the minister'shand in his own broad, hard palm, and squeezed it in anexuberant grip.  "Don't mind his little ways, Brother Ware,"he urged in a loud, unctuous whisper, with a grinningbackward nod:  "he's a trifle skittish sometimes when youdon't give him free rein; but he's all wool an' a yardwide when it comes to right-down hard-pan religion. My love to Sister Ware;" and he followed the seniortrustee into the hall.Mr. Gorringe had been tying up his books and papers. He came now with the bulky parcel under his arm, and his hatand stick in the other hand.  He could give little but histhumb to Theron to shake.  His face wore a grave expression,and not a line relaxed as, catching the minister's look,he slowly covered his left eye in a deliberate wink."Well?--and how did it go off?" asked Alice, from whereshe knelt by the oven door, a few minutes later.For answer, Theron threw himself wearily into the bigold farm rocking-chair on the other side of the stove,and shook his head with a lengthened sigh."If it wasn't for that man Gorringe of yours,"he said dejectedly, "I think I should feel like going off--and learning a trade."Chapter IVOn the following Sunday, young Mrs. Ware sat alone in thepreacher's pew through the morning service, and everybodynoted that the roses had been taken from her bonnet. In the evening she was absent, and after the doxologyand benediction several people, under the pretence ofsolicitude for her health, tried to pump her husband as tothe reason.  He answered their inquiries civilly enough,but with brevity:  she had stayed at home because shedid not feel like coming out--this and nothing more.The congregation dispersed under a gossip-laden cloudof consciousness that there must be something queerabout Sister Ware.  There was a tolerably generalagreement, however, that the two sermons of the dayhad been excellent.  Not even Loren Pierce's railingcommentary on the pastor's introduction of an outlandishword like "epitome"--clearly forbidden by the Discipline'sinjunction to plain language understood of the people--availed to sap the satisfaction of the majority.Theron himself comprehended that he had pleased the bulkof his auditors; the knowledge left him curiously hotand cold.  On the one hand, there was joy in the apparentprospect that the congregation would back him up in astand against the trustees, if worst came to worst. But, on the other hand, the bonnet episode entered his soul. It had been a source of bitter humiliation to him to seehis wife sitting there beneath the pulpit, shorn by despoticorder of the adornments natural to her pretty head. But he had even greater pain in contemplating the effectit had produced on Alice herself.  She had said nota word on the subject, but her every glance and gestureseemed to him eloquent of deep feeling about it. He made sure that she blamed him for having defendedhis own gas and sidewalk rights with successful vigor,but permitted the sacrifice of her poor little inoffensiveroses without a protest.  In this view of the matter,indeed, he blamed himself.  Was it too late to make theerror good?  He ventured a hint on this Sunday evening,when he returned to the parsonage and found her readingan old weekly newspaper by the light of the kitchen lamp,to the effect that he fancied there would be no greatdanger in putting those roses back into her bonnet. Without lifting her eyes from the paper, she answeredthat she had no earthly desire to wear roses in her bonnet,and went on with her reading.At breakfast the next morning Theron found himselfin command of an unusual fund of humorous good spirits,and was at pains to make the most of it, passing whimsicalcomments on subjects which the opening day suggested,recalling quaint and comical memories of the past,and striving his best to force Alice into a laugh. Formerly her merry temper had always ignited at the merestspark of gayety.  Now she gave his jokes only a dutifulhalf-smile, and uttered scarcely a word in responseto his running fire of talk.  When the meal was finished,she went silently to work to clear away the dishes.Theron turned over in his mind the project of offeringto help her, as he had done so often in those dearold days when they laughingly began life together. Something decided this project in the negative for him,and after lingering moments he put on his hat and went outfor a walk.Not even the most doleful and trying hour of his bitterexperience in Tyre had depressed him like this. Looking back upon these past troubles, he persuaded himselfthat he had borne them all with a light and cheerful heart,simply because Alice had been one with him in everythought and emotion.  How perfect, how ideally complete,their sympathy had always been!  With what absoluteunity of mind and soul they had trod that difficultpath together!  And now--henceforth--was it to be different? The mere suggestion of such a thing chilled his veins. He said aloud to himself as he walked that life wouldbe an intolerable curse if Alice were to cease sharing itwith him in every conceivable phase.He had made his way out of town, and tramped along thecountry hill-road for a considerable distance, before amerciful light began to lessen the shadows in the pictureof gloom with which his mind tortured itself.  All at oncehe stopped short, lifted his head, and looked about him. The broad valley lay warm and tranquil in the May sunshineat his feet.  In the thicket up the side-hill above hima gray squirrel was chattering shrilly, and the birds sangin a tireless choral confusion.  Theron smiled, and drewa long breath.  The gay clamor of the woodland songsters,the placid radiance of the landscape, were suddenlytaken in and made a part of his new mood.  He listened,smiled once more, and then started in a leisurely wayback toward Octavius.How could he have been so ridiculous as to fancy that Alice--his Alice--had been changed into someone else?  He marvellednow at his own perverse folly.  She was overworked--tired out--that was all.  The task of moving in, of settingthe new household to rights, had been too much for her. She must have a rest.  They must get in a hired girl.Once this decision about a servant fixed itself in the youngminister's mind, it drove out the last vestage of discomfort. He strode along now in great content, revolving idlya dozen different plans for gilding and beautifying thisnew life of leisure into which his sanguine thoughtsprojected Alice.  One of these particularly pleased him,and waxed in definiteness as he turned it over and over. He would get another piano for her, in place of that which hadbeen sacrificed in Tyre.  That beneficient modern invention,the instalment plan, made this quite feasible--so easy,in fact, that it almost seemed as if he should find hiswife playing on the new instrument when he got home. He would stop in at the music store and see about it thatvery day.Of course, now that these important resolutions had been taken,it would be a good thing if he could do something to bringin some extra money.  This was by no means a new notion. He had mused over the possibility in a formless way eversince that memorable discovery of indebtedness in Tyre,and had long ago recognized the hopelessness of endeavorin every channel save that of literature.  Latterly his fancyhad been stimulated by reading an account of the profitswhich Canon Farrar had derived from his "Life of Christ." If such a book could command such a bewildering multitudeof readers, Theron felt there ought to be a chance for him. So clear did constant rumination render this assumptionthat the young pastor in time had come to regardthis prospective book of his as a substantial asset,which could be realized without trouble whenever he gotaround to it.He had not, it is true, gone to the length of seriouslyconsidering what should be the subject of his book. That had not seemed to him to matter much, so long as itwas scriptural.  Familiarity with the process of extractinga fixed amount of spiritual and intellectual meat fromany casual text, week after week, had given him an ideathat any one of many subjects would do, when the time camefor him to make a choice.  He realized now that the timefor a selection had arrived, and almost simultaneouslyfound himself with a ready-made decision in his mind. The book should be about Abraham!Theron Ware was extremely interested in the mechanismof his own brain, and followed its workings with alively curiosity.  Nothing could be more remarkable,he thought, than to thus discover that, on the instantof his formulating a desire to know what he shouldwrite upon, lo, and behold! there his mind, quite onits own initiative, had the answer waiting for him! When he had gone a little further, and the powerfulrange of possibilities in the son's revolt against theidolatry of his father, the image-maker, in the exodusfrom the unholy city of Ur, and in the influence of thenew nomadic life upon the little deistic family group,had begun to unfold itself before him, he felt that the handof Providence was plainly discernible in the matter. The book was to be blessed from its very inception.Walking homeward briskly now, with his eyes on the sidewalkand his mind all aglow with crowding suggestions for thenew work, and impatience to be at it, he came abruptlyupon a group of men and boys who occupied the whole path,and were moving forward so noiselessly that he had notheard them coming.  He almost ran into the leader of thislittle procession, and began a stammering apology,the final words of which were left unspoken, so solemnlyheedless of him and his talk were all the faces he saw.In the centre of the group were four working-men,bearing between them an extemporized litter of two polesand a blanket hastily secured across them with spikes. Most of what this litter held was covered by another blanket,rounded in coarse folds over a shapeless bulk.  From beneathits farther end protruded a big broom-like black beard,thrown upward at such an angle as to hide everythingbeyond to those in front.  The tall young minister,stepping aside and standing tip-toe, could seesloping downward behind this hedge of beard a pinchedand chalk-like face, with wide-open, staring eyes. Its lips, of a dull lilac hue, were moving ceaselessly,and made a dry, clicking sound.Theron instinctively joined himself to those who followedthe litter--a motley dozen of street idlers, chiefly boys. One of these in whispers explained to him that the manwas one of Jerry Madden's workmen in the wagon-shops,who had been deployed to trim an elm-tree in frontof his employer's house, and, being unused to such work,had fallen from the top and broken all his bones. They would have cared for him at Madden's house, but hehad insisted upon being taken home.  His name was MacEvoy,and he was Joey MacEvoy's father, and likewise Jim'sand Hughey's and Martin's. After a pause the lad,a bright-eyed, freckled, barefooted wee Irishman,volunteered the further information that his big brotherhad run to bring "Father Forbess," on the chance that hemight be in time to administer "extry munction."The way of the silent little procession led throughback streets--where women hanging up clothes in theyards hurried to the gates, their aprons full ofclothes-pins, to stare open-mouthed at the passers-by--and came to a halt at last in an irregular and muddy lane,before one of a half dozen shanties reared amongthe ash-heaps and debris of the town's most bedraggled outskirts.A stout, middle-aged, red-armed woman, already warned by somemessenger of calamity, stood waiting on the roadside bank. There were whimpering children clinging to her skirts,and a surrounding cluster of women of the neighborhood,some of the more elderly of whom, shrivelled littlecrones in tidy caps, and with their aprons to their eyes,were beginning in a low-murmured minor the wailwhich presently should rise into the keen of death. Mrs. MacEvoy herself made no moan, and her broad ruddyface was stern in expression rather than sorrowful. When the litter stopped beside her, she laid a handfor an instant on her husband's wet brow, and looked--one could have sworn impassively--into his staring eyes. Then, still without a word, she waved the bearers towardthe door, and led the way herself.Theron, somewhat wonderingly, found himself, a minute later,inside a dark and ill-smelling room, the air of which washumid with the steam from a boiler of clothes on the stove,and not in other ways improved by the presence of a jostlingscore of women, all straining their gaze upon the opendoor of the only other apartment--the bed-chamber. Throughthis they could see the workmen laying MacEvoy on the bed,and standing awkwardly about thereafter, getting in theway of the wife and old Maggie Quirk as they stroveto remove the garments from his crushed limbs.  As theneighbors watched what could be seen of these proceedings,they whispered among themselves eulogies of the injuredman's industry and good temper, his habit of bringinghis money home to his wife, and the way he kept his FatherMathew pledge and attended to his religious duties. They admitted freely that, by the light of his example,their own husbands and sons left much to be desired,and from this wandered easily off into domesticdigressions of their own.  But all the while their eyeswere bent upon the bedroom door; and Theron made out,after he had grown accustomed to the gloom and the smell,that many of them were telling their beads even while theykept the muttered conversation alive.  None of them paidany attention to him, or seemed to regard his presencethere as unusual.Presently he saw enter through the sunlit street doorwaya person of a different class.  The bright light shonefor a passing instant upon a fashionable, flowered hat,and upon some remarkably brilliant shade of red hairbeneath it.  In another moment there had edged alongthrough the throng, to almost within touch of him, a tallyoung woman, the owner of this hat and wonderful hair. She was clad in light and pleasing spring attire,and carried a parasol with a long oxidized silverhandle of a quaint pattern.  She looked at him,and he saw that her face was of a lengthened oval,with a luminous rose-tinted skin, full red lips,and big brown, frank eyes with heavy auburn lashes. She made a grave little inclination of her head toward him,and he bowed in response.  Since her arrival, he noted,the chattering of the others had entirely ceased."I followed the others in, in the hope that I might beof some assistance," he ventured to explain to her in alow murmur, feeling that at last here was some one to whoman explanation of his presence in this Romish house was due. "I hope they won't feel that I have intruded."She nodded her head as if she quite understood. "They'll take the will for the deed," she whispered back. "Father Forbes will be here in a minute.  Do you know is ittoo late?"Even as she spoke, the outer doorway was darkened by thecommanding bulk of a newcomer's figure.  The flash of a silk hat,and the deferential way in which the assembled neighborsfell back to clear a passage, made his identity clear. Theron felt his blood tingle in an unaccustomed way as thispriest of a strange church advanced across the room--a broad-shouldered, portly man of more than middle height,with a shapely, strong-lined face of almost waxen pallor,and a firm, commanding tread.  He carried in his hands,besides his hat, a small leather-bound case.  To thisand to him the women courtesied and bowed their heads ashe passed."Come with me," whispered the tall girl with the parasolto Theron; and he found himself pushing along in herwake until they intercepted the priest just outsidethe bedroom door.  She touched Father Forbes on the arm."Just to tell you that I am here," she said.  The priestnodded with a grave face, and passed into the other room. In a minute or two the workmen, Mrs. MacEvoy, and her helpercame out, and the door was shut behind them."He is making his confession," explained the young lady. "Stay here for a minute."She moved over to where the woman of the house stood,glum-faced and tearless, and whispered something to her. A confused movement among the crowd followed, and outof it presently resulted a small table, covered with awhite cloth, and bearing on it two unlighted candles,a basin of water, and a spoon, which was brought forwardand placed in readiness before the closed door. Some of those nearest this cleared space were kneeling now,and murmuring a low buzz of prayer to the click of beads ontheir rosaries.The door opened, and Theron saw the priest standing in thedoorway with an uplifted hand.  He wore now a surplice,with a purple band over his shoulders, and on his paleface there shone a tranquil and tender light.One of the workmen fetched from the stove a brand,lighted the two candles, and bore the table with itscontents into the bedroom.  The young woman pluckedTheron's sleeve, and he dumbly followed her into thechamber of death, making one of the group of a dozen,headed by Mrs. MacEvoy and her children, which filled thelittle room, and overflowed now outward to the street door. He found himself bowing with the others to receive thesprinkled holy water from the priest's white fingers;kneeling with the others for the prayers; following inimpressed silence with the others the strange ceremonialby which the priest traced crosses of holy oil with histhumb upon the eyes, ears, nostrils, lips, hands, and feetof the dying man, wiping off the oil with a pieceof cotton-batting each time after he had repeated theinvocation to forgiveness for that particular sense. But most of all he was moved by the rich, novel soundof the Latin as the priest rolled it forth in theASPERGES ME, DOMINE, and MISEREATUR VESTRI OMNIPOTENS DEUS,with its soft Continental vowels and liquid R's. It seemedto him that he had never really heard Latin before. Then the astonishing young woman with the red hairdeclaimed the CONFITEOR, vigorously and with a resonantdistinctness of enunciation.  It was a different Latin,harsher and more sonorous; and while it still dominatedthe murmured undertone of the other's prayers, the last moment came.Theron had stood face to face with death at many other bedsides;no other final scene had stirred him like this. It must have been the girl's Latin chant, with its clangingreiteration of the great names--BEATUM MICHAELEM ARCHANGELUM,BEATUM JOANNEM BAPTISTAM, SANCTOS APOSTOLOS PETRUMET PAULUM--invoked with such proud confidence in thissqualid little shanty, which so strangely affected him.He came out with the others at last--the candles and thefolded hands over the crucifix left behind--and walkedas one in a dream.  Even by the time that he had gainedthe outer doorway, and stood blinking at the brightlight and filling his lungs with honest air once more,it had begun to seem incredible to him that he had seenand done all this.CHAPTER VWhile Mr. Ware stood thus on the doorstep, through a minuteof formless musing, the priest and the girl came out, and,somewhat to his confusion, made him one of their party. He felt himself flushing under the idea that they would thinkhe had waited for them--was thrusting himself upon them. The notion prompted him to bow frigidly in responseto Father Forbes' pleasant "I am glad to meet you, sir,"and his outstretched hand."I dropped in by the--the merest accident," Theron said. "I met them bringing the poor man home, and--and quitewithout thinking, I obeyed the impulse to follow them in,and didn't realize--"He stopped short, annoyed by the reflection that thiswas his second apology.  The girl smiled placidly at him,the while she put up her parasol."It did me good to see you there," she said, quite as ifshe had known him all her life.  "And so it did the restof us."Father Forbes permitted himself a soft little chuckle,approving rather than mirthful, and patted her on theshoulder with the air of being fifty years her seniorinstead of fifteen.  To the minister's relief, he changedthe subject as the three started together toward the road."Then, again, no doctor was sent for!" he exclaimed,as if resuming a familiar subject with the girl.  Then heturned to Theron.  "I dare-say you have no such trouble;but with our poorer people it is very vexing. They will not call in a physician, but hurry off firstfor the clergyman.  I don't know that it is altogetherto avoid doctor's bills, but it amounts to that in effect. Of course in this case it made no difference; but I havehad to make it a rule not to go out at night unless theybring me a physician's card with his assurance that itis a genuine affair.
