was falsely accused of a crime and banished mycountry. I can prove my innocence now if I can but get home with a greatdeal of money. So much for _me._ You are a member of the vainest and mostgenerous nation in the world.""Wal, now that's kinder honey and vinegar mixed," said Fullalove; "prettygood for a Britisher, though.""You are a man of that nation which in all the agonies and unparalleledexpenses of civil war, smarting, too, under anonymous taunts fromEngland, did yet send over a large sum to relieve the distresses ofcertain poor Englishmen who were indirect victims of that same calamity.The act, the time, the misery relieved, the taunts overlooked, prove yournation superior to all others in generosity. At least my reading, whichis very large, affords no parallel to it, either in ancient or modernhistory. Mr. Fullalove, please to recollect that you are a member of thatnation, and that I am very unhappy and helpless, and want money to undocruel wrongs, but have no heart to chaffer much. Take the island and thetreasures, and give me half the profits you make. Is not that fair?"Fullalove wore a rueful countenance."Darn the critter," said he, "he'll take skin off my bones if I don'tmind. Fust Britisher ever I met as had the sense to see _that._ 'Twasrather handsome, warn't it? Wal, human nature is deep; every man youtackle in business larns ye something. What with picking ye out o' thesea, and you giving me back the harpoon the cuss stole, and your facelike a young calf, when you are the 'cutest fox out, and you giving thegreat United States their due, I'm no more fit to deal than mashedpotatoes. Now I cave; it is only for once. Next time don't you try topalaver me. Draw me a map of our island, Britisher, and mark where theSpaniard lies. I tell _you_ I know her name, and the year she was lostin; learned that at Lima one day. Kinder startled me, you did, when youshowed me the coin out of her. Wal, there's my hand on haelf profits,and, if I'm keen, I'm squar'."Soon after this he led Robert to his cabin, and Robert drew a large mapfrom his models; and Fullalove, being himself an excellent draughtsman,and provided with proper instruments, aided him to finish it.Next day they sighted Valparaiso, and hove to outside the port.All the specimens of insular wealth were put on board the schooner andsecreted; for Fullalove's first move was to get a lease of the islandfrom the Chilian government, and it was no part of his plan to trumpetthe article he was going to buy.After a moment's hesitation, he declined to take the seven pounds ofsilver. He gave as a reason that, having made a bargain which compelledhim to go to Valparaiso at once, he did not feel like charging hispartner a fancy price for towing his boat thither. At the same time hehinted that, after all this, the next customer would find him a verydifficult Yankee to get the better of.With this understanding, he gave Robert a draft for eighty pounds onaccount of profits; and this enabled him to take a passage for Englandwith all his belongings.He arrived at Southampton very soon after the events last related, andthence went to London, fully alive to the danger of his position.He had a friend in his long beard, but he dared not rely on that alone.Like a mole, he worked at night.CHAPTER LXVI.HELEN asked Arthur Wardlaw why he was so surprised at the prayer-bookbeing brought back. Was it worth twenty pounds to any one exceptherself?Arthur looked keenly at her to see whether she intended more than met theear, and then said he was surprised at the rapid effect of hisadvertisement, that was all."Now you have got the book," said he, "I do hope you will erase thatcruel slander on one whom you mean to honor with your hand."This proposal made Helen blush and feel very miserable. Of the obnoxiouslines some were written by Robert Penfold, and she had so little of hisdear handwriting. "I feel you are right, Arthur," said she; "but you mustgive me time. Then, they shall meet no eye but mine; and on ourwedding-day--of course--all memorials of one--" Tears completed thesentence.Arthur Wardlaw, raging with jealousy at the absent Penfold, as heretoforePenfold had raged at him, heaved a deep sigh and hurried away, whileHelen was locking up the prayer-book in her desk. By this means heretained Helen's pity.He went home directly, mounted to his bedroom, unlocked a safe, andplunged his hand into it. His hand encountered a book; he drew it outwith a shiver and gazed at it with terror and amazement.It was the prayer-book he had picked up in the Square and locked up inthat safe. Yet that very prayer-book had been restored to Helen beforehis eyes, and was now locked up in her desk. He sat down with the book inhis hand, and a great dread came over him.Hitherto Candor and Credulity only had been opposed to him, but nowCunning had entered the field against him; a master hand was co-operatingwith Helen.Yet, strange to say, she seemed unconscious of that co-operation. HadRobert Penfold found his way home by some strange means? Was he watchingover her in secret?He had the woman he loved watched night and day, but no Robert Penfoldwas detected.He puzzled his brain night and day, and at last he conceived a plan ofdeceit which is common enough in the East, where lying is one of the finearts, but was new in this country, we believe, and we hope to Heaven weshall not be the means of importing it.An old clerk of his father's, now superannuated and pensioned off, had ason upon the stage, in a very mean position. Once a year, however, and ofcourse in the dogdays, he had a kind of benefit at his suburban theater;that is to say, the manager allowed him to sell tickets, and take halfthe price of them. He persuaded Arthur to take some, and even to go tothe theater for an hour. The man played a little part, of a pompoussneak, with some approach to Nature. He seemed at home.Arthur found this man out; visited him at his own place. He was verypoor, and mingled pomposity with obsequiousness, so that Arthur feltconvinced he was to be bought, body and soul, what there was of him.He sounded him accordingly, and the result was that the man agreed toperform a part for him.Arthur wrote it, and they rehearsed it together. As to the dialogue, thatwas so constructed that it could be varied considerably according to thecues, which could be foreseen to a certain extent; but not precisely,since they were to be given by Helen Rolleston, who was not in thesecret.But while this plot was fermenting, other events happened, with rather acontrary tendency; and these will be more intelligible if we go back toNancy Rouse's cottage, where indeed we have kept Joseph Wylie in anuncomfortable position a very long time.Mrs. James, from next door, was at last admitted into Nancy's kitchen,and her first word was, "I suppose you know what I'm come about, ma'am.""Which it is to return me the sasspan you borrowed, no doubt," wasNancy's ingenuous reply."No, ma'am. But I'll send my girl in with it, as soon as she have cleanedit, you may depend.""Thank ye, I shall be glad to see it again.""You're not afeard I shall steal it, I hope?"'"La, bless the woman! don't fly out at a body like that. I can't affordto give away my sasspan.""Sasspans is not in my head.""Nor in your hand neither.""I'm come about my lodger; a most respectable gentleman, which he havemet with an accident. He did but go to put something away in thechimbley, which he is a curious gent, and has traveled a good deal, andlearned the foreign customs, when his hand was caught in the brick-work,somehows, and there he is hard and fast.""Do you know anything about this?" said Nancy to the mite, severely."No," said the mite, with a countenance of polished granite."La bless me" said Nancy, with a sudden start. "Why, is she talking aboutthe thief as you and I catched putting his hand through the wall into myroom, and made him fast again the policeman comes round?""Thief!" cried Mrs. James. "No more a thief than I am. Why, sure youwouldn't ever be so cruel! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Spite goes a far length.There, take an' kill me, do, and then you'll be easy in your mind. Ah,little my poor father thought as ever I should come down to lettinglodgings, and being maltreated this way! I am--""Who is a maltreating of ye? Why, you're dreaming. Have a drop o' gin?""With them as takes the police to my lodger? It would choke me.""Well, have a drop, and we'll see about it.""You're very kind, ma'am, I'm sure. Heaven knows I need it! Here'swishing you a good husband; and toward burying all unkindness.""Which you means drounding of it.""Ah, you're never at a loss for a word, ma'am, and always in goodspirits. But your troubles is to come. _I'm_ a widdy. You will let me seewhat is the matter with my lodger, ma'am?""Why not? We'll go and have a look at him."Accordingly, the three women and the mite proceeded to the little room;Nancy turned the gas on, and then they inspected the imprisoned hand.Mrs. James screamed with dismay, and Nancy asked her dryly whether shewas to blame for seizing a hand which had committed a manifest trespass."You have got the rest of his body," said she, "but this here handbelongs to me.""Lord, ma'am, what could he take out of your chimbley, without 'twas ahandful of soot? Do, pray, let me loose him.""Not till I have said two words to him.""But how can you? He isn't here to speak to--only a morsel of him.""I can go into your house and speak to him."Mrs. James demurred to that; but Nancy stood firm; Mrs. James yielded.Nancy whispered her myrmidons, and, in a few minutes, was standing by theprisoner, a reverend person in dark spectacles, and a gray beard, thatcreated commiseration, or would have done so, but that this stroke ofill-fortune had apparently fallen upon a great philosopher. He hadcontrived to get a seat under him, and was smoking a pipe with admirablesang-froid.At sight of Nancy, however, he made a slight motion, as if he would notobject to follow his imprisoned hand through the party-wall. It was onlyfor a moment; the next, he smoked imperturbably."Well, sir," said Nancy, "I hopes you are comfortable?""Thank ye, miss; yes. I'm at a double sheet-anchor.""Why do you call me miss?""I don't know. Because you are so young and pretty.""That will do. I only wanted to hear the sound of your voice, Joe Wylie."And with the word she snatched his wig off with one hand, and his beardwith the other, and revealed his true features to his astonishedlandlady."There, mum," said she, "I wish you joy of your lodger." She tapped thechimney three times with the poker, and, telling Mr. Wylie she had a fewwords to say to him in private, retired for the present. Mrs. James satdown and mourned the wickedness of mankind, the loss of her lodger (whowould now go bodily next door instead of sending his hand), and thebetter days she had by iteration brought herself to believe she had seen.Wylie soon entered Nancy's house, and her first question was, "The 2,000pounds, how did you get them?""No matter how I got them," said Wylie, sulkily. "What have you done withthem?""Put them away.""That is all right. I'm blest if I didn't think they were gone forever.""I wish they had never come. Ill-gotten money is a curse." Then she taxedhim with scuttling the _Proserpine,_ and asked him whether that money hadnot been the bribe. But Joe was obdurate. "I never split on a friend,"said he. "And you have nobody to blame but yourself, you wouldn't splicewithout 2,000 pounds. I loved you, and I got it how I could. D'ye think apoor fellow like me can make 2,000 pounds in a voyage by hauling inropes, and tying true-lovers' knots in the foretop?"Nancy had her answer ready, but this remembrance pricked her ownconscience and paved the way to a reconciliation. Nancy had no high-flownnotions. She loved money, but it must be got without palpable dishonesty;_per contra,_ she was not going to denounce her sweetheart, but thenagain she would not marry him so long as he differed with her about themeaning of the eighth commandment.This led to many arguments, some of them warm, some affectionate; and sowe leave Mr. Wylie under the slow but salutary influence of love andunpretending probity. He continued to lodge next door. Nancy would onlyreceive him as a visitor.CHAPTER LXVII.HELEN had complained to Arthur, of all people, that she was watched andfollowed; she even asked him whether that was not the act of some enemy.Arthur smiled, and said: "Take my word for it, it is only some foolishadmirer of your beauty; he wants to know your habits, in hopes of fallingin with you; you had better let me go out with you for the next month orso; that sort of thing will soon die away."As a necessary consequence of this injudicious revelation, Helen waswatched with greater skill and subtlety, and upon a plan well calculatedto disarm suspicion; a spy watched the door, and by a signalunintelligible to any but his confederate, whom Helen could not possiblysee, set the latter on her track. They kept this game up unobserved forseveral days, but learned nothing, for Helen was at a standstill. At lastthey got caught, and by a truly feminine stroke of observation. A showilydressed man peeped into a shop where Helen was buying gloves.With one glance of her woman's eye she recognized a large breast-pin inthe worst possible taste; thence her eye went up and recognized thefeatures of her seedy follower, though he was now dressed up to the nine.She withdrew her eye directly, completed her purchase, and went home,brooding defense and vengeance.That evening she dined with a lady who had a large acquaintance withlawyers, and it so happened that Mr. Tollemache and Mr. Hennessy wereboth of the party. Now, when these gentlemen saw Helen in full costume, aqueen in form as well as face, coroneted with her island pearls,environed with a halo of romance, and courted by women as well as men,they looked up to her with astonishment, and made up to her in a verydifferent style from that in which they had received her visit.Tollemache she received coldly; he had defended Robert Penfold feebly,and she hated him for it. Hennessy she received graciously, and,remembering Robert's precept to be supple as a woman, bewitched him. Hewas good-natured, able and vain. By eleven o'clock she had enlisted himin her service. When she had conquered him, she said, slyly, "But I oughtnot to speak of these things to you except through a solicitor.""That is the general rule," said the learned counsel; "but in this caseno dark body must come between me and the sun."In short he entered into Penfold's case with such well-feigned warmth, toplease the beauteous girl, that at last she took him by the horns andconsulted."I am followed," said she."I have no doubt you are; and on a large scale; if there is room foranother, I should be glad to join the train.""Ha! ha! I'll save you the trouble. I'll meet you half way. But, to beserious, I am watched, spied and followed by some enemy to that goodfriend whose sacred cause we have undertaken. Forgive me for saying'we.'""I am too proud of the companionship to let you off. 'We' is the word.""Then advise me what to do. I want to retaliate. I want to discover whois watching me, and why. Can you advise me? Will you?"The counsel reflected a moment, and Helen, who watched him, remarked thepower that suddenly came into his countenance and brow."You must watch the spies. I have influence in Scotland Yard, and willget it done for you. If you went there yourself they would cross-examineyou and decline to interfere. I'll go myself for you and put it in acertain light. An able detective will call on you. Give him ten guineas,and let him into your views in confidence; then he will work the publicmachinery for you.""Oh, Mr. Hennessy, how can I thank you?""By succeeding. I hate to fail. And now your cause is mine."Next day a man with a hooked nose, a keen black eye, and a solitaryfoible (Mosaic), called on Helen Rolleston, and told her he was to takeher instructions. She told him she was watched, and thought it was doneto baffle a mission she had undertaken; but, having got so far, sheblushed and hesitated."The more you tell me, miss, the more use I can be," said Mr. Burt.Thus encouraged, and also remembering Mr. Hennessy's advice, she gave Mr.Burt, as coldly as she could, an outline of Robert Penfold's case, and ofthe exertions she had made, and the small result.Burt listened keenly, and took a note or two; and, when she had done, hetold her something in return."Miss Rolleston," said he, "I am the officer that arrested RobertPenfold. It cost me a grinder that he knocked out.""Oh, dear!" said Helen, "how unfortunate! Then I fear I cannot reckon onyour services.""Why not, miss? What, do you think I hold spite against a poor fellow fordefending himself? Besides, Mr. Penfold wrote me a very proper note.Certainly for a parson the gent is a very quick hitter; but he wrote verysquare; said he hoped I would allow for the surprise and the agitation ofan innocent man; sent me two guineas, too, and said he would make ittwenty but he was poor as well as unfortunate; that letter has stuck inmy gizzard ever since; can't see the color of felony in it. Your felon isnever in a fault; and, if he wears a good coat, he isn't given to showfight.""It was very improper of him to strike you," said Helen, "and very nobleof you to forgive it. Make him still more ashamed of it; lay him under adeep obligation.""If he is innocent, I'll try and prove it," said the detective. He thenasked her if she had taken notes. She said she had a diary. He begged tosee it. She felt inclined to withhold it, because of the comments; but,remembering that this was womanish, and that Robert's orders to her wereto be manly on such occasions, she produced her diary. Mr. Burt read itvery carefully, and told her it was a very promising case. "You have donea great deal more than you thought," he said. _"You have netted thefish."_CHAPTER LXVIII."I NETTED the fish! what fish?""The man who forged the promissory note.""Oh, Mr. Burt!""The same man that forged the newspaper extracts to deceive you forgedthe promissory note years ago, and the man who is setting spies on you isthe man who forged those extracts; so we are sure to nail him. He is inthe net; and very much to your credit. Leave the rest to me. I'll tellyou more about it to-morrow. You must order your carriage at one o'clocktomorrow and drive down to Scotland Yard; go into the Yard, and you willsee me; follow me without a word. When you go back, the other spies willbe so frightened they will go off to their employer, and so we shall nailhim."Helen complied with these instructions strictly, and then returned home,leaving Mr. Burt to work. She had been home about half an hour, when theservant brought her up a message saying that a man wanted to speak toher. "Admit him," said Helen."He is dressed very poor, miss.""Never mind; send him to me."She was afraid to reject anybody now, lest she might turn her back oninformation.A man presented himself in well-worn clothes, with a wash-leather faceand close-shaven chin; a little of his forehead was also shaven."Madam, my name is Hand." Helen started. "I have already had the honor ofwriting to you.""Yes, sir," said Helen, eying him with fear and aversion."Madam, I am come"--(he hesitated)--"I am an unfortunate man. Weigheddown by remorse for a thoughtless act that has ruined an innocent man,and nearly cost my worthy employer his life, I come to expiate as far asin me lies. But let me be brief and hurry over the tale of shame. I was aclerk at Wardlaw's office. A bill-broker called Adams was talking to meand my fellow-clerks, and boasting that nobody could take him in with afeigned signature. Bets were laid; our vanity was irritated by hispretension. It was my fortune to overhear my young master and his friendRobert Penfold speak about a loan of two thousand pounds. In an evil hourI listened to the tempter and wrote a forged note for that amount. I tookit to Mr. Penfold; he presented it to Adams, and it was cashed. Iintended, of course, to call next day, and tell Mr. Penfold, and take himto Adams, and restore the money and get back the note. It was not due forthree months. Alas! that very day it fell under suspicion. Mr. Penfoldwas arrested. My young master was struck down with illness at hisfriend's guilt, though he never could be quite got to believe it; andI--miserable coward!--dared not tell the truth. Ever since that day Ihave been a miserable man. The other day I came into money, and leftWardlaw's service. But I carry my remorse with me. Madam, I am come totell the truth. I dare not tell it to Mr. Wardlaw; I think he would killme. But I will tell it to you, and you can tell it to him; ay, tell it toall the world. Let my shame be as public as his whom I have injured sodeeply, but, Heaven knows, unintentionally. I--I--I--"Mr. Hand sank all in a heap where he sat, and could say no more.Helen's flesh crawled at this confession, and at the sight of thisreptile who owned that he had destroyed Robert Penfold in fear andcowardice. For a long time her wrath so overpowered all sense of pitythat she sat trembling; and, if eyes could kill, Mr. Hand would not haveoutlived his confession.At last she contrived to speak. She turned her head away not to see thewretch and said, sternly:"Are you prepared to make this statement on paper, if called on?"Mr. Hand hesitated, but said, "Yes.""Then write down that Robert Penfold was innocent, and you are ready toprove it whenever you may be called upon.""Write that down?" said Hand."Unless your penitence is feigned, you will.""Sooner than that should be added to my crime I will avow all." He wrotethe few lines she required."Now your address, that I may know where to find you at a moment'snotice." He wrote, "J. Hand, 11 Warwick Street, Pimlico."Helen then dismissed him, and wept bitterly. In that condition she wasfound by Arthur Wardlaw, who comforted her, and, on hearing her report ofHand's confession, burst out into triumph, and reminded her he had alwayssaid Robert Penfold was innocent. "My father," said he, "must yield tothis evidence, and we will lay it before the Secretary of State and gethis pardon.""His pardon! when he is innocent!""Oh, that is the form--the only form. The rest must be done by the warmreception of his friends. I, for one, who all these years have maintainedhis innocence, will be the first to welcome him to my house an honoredguest. What am I saying? Can I? dare I? ought I? when my wife-- Ah! I ammore to be pitied than my poor friend is; my friend, my rival. Well, Ileave it to you whether he can come into your husband's house.""Never.""But, at least, I can send the _Springbok_ out, and bring him home; andthat I will do without one day's delay.""Oh, Arthur!" cried Helen, "you set me an example of unselfishness.""I do what I can," said Arthur. "I am no saint. I hope for a reward."Helen sighed. "What shall I do?""Have pity on _me!_ your faithful lover, and to whom your faith wasplighted before ever you saw or knew my unhappy friend. What can I do orsuffer more than I have done and suffered for you? My sweet Helen, havepity on me, and be my wife.""I will, some day.""Bless you. Bless you. One effort more. What day?""I can't. I can't. My heart is dead.""This day fortnight. Let me speak to your father. Let him name the day."As she made no reply, he kissed her hand devotedly, and did speak to herfather. Sir Edward, meaning all for the best, said, "This day fortnight."CHAPTER LXIX.THE next morning came the first wedding presents from the jubilantbridegroom, who was determined to advance step by step, and give nobreathing time. When Helen saw them laid out by her maid, she trembled atthe consequences of not giving a plump negative to so brisk a wooer.The second post brought two letters; one of them from Mrs. Undercliff.The other contained no words, but only a pearl of uncommon size, andpear-shaped. Helen received this at first as another wedding present, andan attempt on Arthur's part to give her a pearl as large as those she hadgathered on her dear island. But, looking narrowly at the address, shesaw it was not written by Arthur; and, presently, she was struck by thelikeness of this pearl in shape to some of her own. She got out herpearls, laid them side by side, and began to be moved exceedingly. Shehad one of her instincts, and it set every fiber quivering withexcitement. It was some time before she could take her eyes off thepearls, and it was with a trembling hand she opened Mrs. Undercliff'sletter. That missive was not calculated to calm her. It ran thus:"MY DEAR YOUNG LADY--A person called here last night and supplied theclew. If you have the courage to know the truth, you have only to comehere, and to bring your diary, and all the letters you have received fromany person or persons since you landed in England. I am yours obediently,JANE UNDERCLIFF."The courage to know the truth!This mysterious sentence affected Helen considerably. But her faith inRobert was too great to be shaken. She would not wait for the canonicalhour at which young ladies go out, but put on her bonnet directly afterbreakfast. Early as she was, a visitor came before she could start--Mr.Burt, the detective. She received him in the library.Mr. Burt looked at her dress and her little bag, and said, "I'm very gladI made bold to call so early.""You have got information of importance to communicate to me?""I think so, miss;" and he took out his note-book. "The person you arewatched by is Mr. Arthur Wardlaw." The girl stared at him. "Both spiesreport to him twice a day at his house in Russell Square.""Be careful, Mr. Burt; this is a serious thing to say, and may haveserious consequences.""Well, miss, you told me you wanted to know the truth.""Of course I want to know the truth.""Then the truth is that you are watched by order of Mr. Wardlaw."Burt continued his report."A shabby-like man called on you yesterday.""Yes; it was Mr. Hand, Mr. Wardlaw's clerk. And, oh, Mr. Burt, thatwretched creature came and confessed the truth. It was he who forged thenote, out of sport, and for a bet, and then was too cowardly to own it."She then detailed Hand's confession."His penitence comes too late," said she, with a deep sigh."It hasn't come yet," said Burt, dryly. "Of course my lambs followed theman. He went first to his employer, and then he went home. His name isnot Hand. He is not a clerk at all, but a little actor at the CorinthianSaloon. Hand is in America; went three months ago. I ascertained thatfrom another quarter.""Oh, goodness!" cried Helen, "what a wretched world! I can't see my way ayard for stories.""How should you, miss? It is clear enough, for all that. Mr. Wardlawhired this actor to pass for Hand, and tell you a lie that he thoughtwould please you."Helen put her hand to her brow, and thought; but her candid soul gotsadly in the way of her brain. "Mr. Burt," said she, "will you go with meto Mr. Undercliff, the expert?""With pleasure, ma'am; but let me finish my report. Last night there wassomething new. Your house was watched by six persons. Two were Wardlaw's,three were Burt's; but the odd man was there on his own hook; and my mencould not make him out at all; but they think one of Wardlaw's men knewhim; for he went off to Russell Square like the wind and brought Mr.Wardlaw here in disguise. Now, miss, that is all; and shall I call a cab,and we'll hear Undercliff's tale?"The cab was called, and they went to Undercliff. On the way Helenbrooded; but the detective eyed every man and everything on the road withthe utmost keenness.Edward Undercliff was at work at lithographing. He received Helencordially, nodded to Burt, and said she could not have a betterassistant.He then laid his fac-simile of the forged note on the table, with JohnWardlaw's genuine writing and Penfold's indorsement. "Look at that, Mr.Burt."Burt inspected the papers keenly."You know, Burt, I swore at Robert Penfold's trial that he never wrotethat forged note.""I remember," said Burt."The other day this lady instructed me to discover, if I could, who didwrite the forged note. But, unfortunately, the materials she gave me werenot sufficient. But, last night, a young man dropped from the clouds,that I made sure was an agent of yours, Miss Rolleston. Under thatimpression I was rather unguarded, and I let him know how far we had got,and could get no further. 'I think I can help you,' says this young man,and puts a letter on the table. Well, Mr. Burt, a glance at that letterwas enough for me. It was written by the man who forged the note.""A letter!" said Helen."Yes. I'll put the letter by the side of the forged note; and, if youhave any eye for writing at all, you'll see at once that one hand wrotethe forged note and this letter. I am also prepared to swear that theletters signed Hand are forgeries by the same person." He then coolly putupon the table the letter from Arthur Wardlaw that Helen had received onboard the _Proserpine,_ and was proceeding to point out the many pointsof resemblance between the letter and the document, when he wasinterrupted by a scream from Helen."Ah!" she cried, "he is here. Only one man in the world could havebrought that letter. I left it on the island. Robert is here. He gave youthat letter.""You are right," said the expert, "and what a fool I must be! I have noeye except for handwriting. He had a beard; and such a beard!""It is Robert!" cried Helen, in raptures. "He is come just in time.""In time to be arrested," said Burt. "Why, his time is not out. He'll getinto trouble again.""Oh, Heaven forbid!" cried Helen, and turned so faint she had to be laidback on a chair, and salts applied to her nostrils.She soon came to, and cried and trembled, but prepared to defend herRobert with all a woman's wit. Burt and Undercliff were conversing in alow voice, and Burt was saying he felt sure Wardlaw's spies had detectedRobert Penfold, and that Robert would be arrested and put into prison asa runaway convict. "Go to Scotland Yard this minute, Mr. Burt," saidHelen, eagerly."What for?""Why, you must take the commission to arrest him. You are our friend."Burt slapped his thigh with delight."That is first-rate, miss," said he. "I'll take the real felon, first,you may depend. Now, Mr. Undercliff, write your report, and hand it toMiss Helen with fac-similes. It will do no harm if you make a declarationto the same effect before a magistrate. You, Miss Rolleston, keepyourself disengaged, and please don't go out. You will very likely hearfrom me again to-day."He drove off, and Helen, though still greatly agitated by Robert's dangerand the sense of his presence, now sat down, trembling a little, andcompared Arthur's letter with the forged document. The effect of thiscomparison was irresistible. The expert, however, asked her for someletter of Arthur's that had never passed through Robert Penfold's hands.She gave him the short note in which he used the very words, RobertPenfold. He said he would make that note the basis of his report.While he was writing it, Mrs. Undercliff came in, and Helen told her all.She said, "I came to the same conclusion long ago; but when you said hewas to be your husband--""Ah," said Helen, "we women are poor creatures; we can always find somereason for running away from the truth. Now explain about theprayer-book.""Well, miss, I felt sure he would steal it, so I made Ned produce afac-simile. And he did steal it. What you got back was your mother'sprayer-book. Of course I took care of that.""Oh, Mrs. Undercliff," cried Helen, "do let me kiss you."Then they had a nice little cry together, and, by the time they had done,the report was ready in duplicate."I'll declare this before a magistrate," said the expert, "and then I'llsend it you."At four o'clock of this eventful day, Helen got a message from Burt tosay that he had orders to arrest Robert Penfold, and that she must wear amask, and ask Mr. Wardlaw to meet her at old Mr. Penfold's at nineo'clock. But she herself must be there at half-past eight, without fail,and bring Undercliff's declaration and report with her, and theprayer-book, etc.Accordingly Helen went down to old Mr. Penfold's at half-past eight andwas received by Nancy Rouse, and ushered into Mr. Penfold's room; that isto say, Nancy held the door open, and, on her entering the room, shut itsharply and ran down stairs.Helen entered the room; a man rose directly, and came to her; but it wasnot Michael Penfold--it was Robert. A faint scream, a heavenly sigh, andher head was on his shoulder, and her arm round his neck, and both theirhearts panting as they gazed, and then clung to each other, and thengazed again with love unutterable. After a while they got sufficientcomposure to sit down hand in hand and compare notes. And Helen showedhim their weapons of defense, the prayer-book, the expert's report, etc.A discreet tap was heard at the door. It was Nancy Rouse. On beinginvited to enter, she came in and said, "Oh, Miss Helen, I've got apenitent outside, which he done it for love of me, and now he'll make aclean breast, and the fault was partly mine. Come in, Joe, and speak foryourself."On this, Joe Wylie came in, hanging his head, piteously."She is right, sir," said he; "I'm come to ask your pardon and thelady's. Not as I ever meant you any harm; but to destroy the ship, it wasa bad act, and I've never throve since. Nance, she have got the money.I'll give it back to the underwriters; and, if you and the lady willforgive a poor fellow that was tempted with love and money, why, I'llstand to the truth for you, though it's a bitter pill.""I forgive you," said Robert; "and I accept your offer to serve me.""And so do I," said Helen. "Indeed, it is not us you have wronged. Butoh, I _am_ glad, for Nancy's sake, that you repent.""Miss, I'll go through fire and water for you," said Wylie, lifting uphis head.Here old Michael came in to say that Arthur Wardlaw was at the door, witha policeman."Show him in," said Robert."Oh, no, Robert!" said Helen. "He fills me with horror.""Show him in," said Robert, gently. "Sit down, all of you."Now Burt had not told Arthur who was in the house, so he came, ratheruneasy in his mind, but still expecting only to see Helen.Robert Penfold told Helen to face the door, and the rest to sit back; andthis arrangement had not been effected one second, when Arthur came in,with a lover's look, and, taking two steps into the room, saw the threemen waiting to receive him. At sight of Penfold, he started and turnedpale as ashes; but, recovering himself, said: "My dearest Helen, this isindeed an unexpected pleasure. You will reconcile me to one whose worthand innocence I never doubted, and tell him I have had some little handin clearing him."His effrontery was received in dead silence. This struck cold to hisbones, and, being naturally weak, he got violent. He said, "Allow me tosend a message to my servant."He then tore a leaf out of his memorandum-book, wrote on it: "RobertPenfold is here; arrest him directly, and take him away"; and, inclosingthis in an envelope, sent it out to Burt by Nancy.Helen seated herself quietly, and said, "Mr. Wardlaw, when did Mr. Handgo to America?"Arthur stammered out, "I don't know the exact date.""Two or three months ago?""Yes.""Then the person you sent to me to tell me that falsehood was not Mr.Hand?""I sent nobody.""Oh, for shame! for shame! Why have you set spies? Why did you make awaywith my prayer-book; or what you thought was my prayer-book? Here _is_ myprayer-book, that proves you had the _Proserpine_ destroyed; and I shouldhave lost my life but for another, whom you had done your best todestroy. Look Robert Penfold in the face, if you can."Arthur's eyes began to waver. "I can," said he. "I never wronged him. Ialways lamented his misfortune.""You were not the cause?""Never!--so help me Heaven!""Monster!" said Helen, turning away in contempt and horror."Oh, that is it--is it?" said Arthur, wildly. "You break faith with mefor _him?_ You insult me for _him?_ I must bear anything from you, for Ilove you; but, at least, I will sweep _him_ out of the path."He ran to the door, opened it, and there was Burt, listening."Are you an officer?""Yes.""Then arrest that man this moment: he is Robert Penfold, a convictreturned before his time."Burt came into the room, locked the door and put the key in his pocket."Well, sir," said he to Robert Penfold, "I know you are a quick hitter.Don't let us have a row over it this time. If you have got anything tosay, say it quiet and comfortable.""I will go with you on one condition," said Robert. "You must take thefelon as well as the martyr. This is the felon," and he laid his hand onArthur's shoulder, who cowered under the touch at first, but soon beganto act violent indignation."Take the ruffian away at once," he cried."What, before I hear what he has got to say?""Would you listen to him against a merchant of the city of London, a manof unblemished reputation?""Well, sir, you see we have got a hint that you were concerned inscuttling a ship; and that is a felony. So I think I'll just hear what hehas got to say. You need not _fear_ any man's tongue if you areinnocent.""Sit down, if you please, and examine these documents," said RobertPenfold. "As to the scuttling of the ship, here is the deposition of twoseamen, taken on their death-bed, and witnessed by Miss Rolleston andmyself.""And that book he tried to steal," said Helen.Robert continued: "And here is Undercliff's fac-simile of the forgednote. Here are specimens of Arthur Wardlaw's handwriting, and here isUndercliff's report."The detective ran his eye hastily over the report, which we slightlycondense.On comparing the forged note with genuine specimens of John Wardlaw'shandwriting, no less than twelve deviations from his habits of writingstrike the eye; and every one of these twelve deviations is a deviationinto a habit of Arthur Wardlaw, which is an amount of demonstrationrarely attained in cases of forgery.1. THE CAPITAL L.--Compare in London (forged note) with the same letterin London in Wardlaw's letter.2. THE CAPITAL D.--Compare this letter in "Date" with the same letter in"Dearest."3. THE CAPITAL T.--Compare it in "Two" and "Tollemache."4. The word "To"; see "To pay," in forged note and third line of letter.5. Small "o" formed with a loop in the up-stroke.6. The manner of finishing the letter "v."7. Ditto the letter "w."8. The imperfect formation of the small "a." This and the looped "o" runthrough the forged note and Arthur Wardlaw's letter, and are habitsentirely foreign to the style of John Wardlaw.9. See the "th" in connection.10. Ditto the "of" in connection.11. The incautious use of the Greek e. John Wardlaw never uses this e.Arthur Wardlaw never uses any other, apparently. The writer of the forgednote began right, but, at the word Robert Penfold, glided insensibly intohis Greek e, and maintained it to the end of the forgery. This looks asif he was in the habit of writing those two words.12. Compare the words "Robert Penfold" in the forged document with thesame words in the letter. The similarity is so striking that on these twowords alone the writer could be identified beyond a doubt.13. Great pains were taken with the signature, and it is like JohnWardlaw's writing on the surface; but go below the surface, and it is allArthur Wardlaw.The looped o, the small r, the l drooping below the d, the open a, areall Arthur Wardlaw's. The open loop of the final w is a still bolderdeviation into A. W. 's own hand. The final flourish is a curiousmistake. It is executed with skill and freedom; but the writer has madethe lower line the thick one. Yet John Wardlaw never does this.How was the deviation caused? Examine the final flourish in ArthurWardlaw's signature. It contains one stroke only, but then that stroke isa thick one. He thought he had only to prolong his own stroke and bringit round. He did this extremely well, but missed the deepercharacteristic--the thick upper stroke. This is proof of a highcharacter: and altogether I am prepared to testify upon oath that thewriter of the letter to Miss Rolleston, who signs himself Arthur Wardlaw,is the person who forged the promissory note.To these twelve proofs one more was now added. Arthur Wardlaw rose, and,with his knees knocking together, said, "Don't arrest him, Burt; let himgo.""Don't let _him_ go," cried old Penfold. "A villain! I have got thenumber of the notes from Benson. I can prove he bribed this poor man todestroy the ship. Don't let him go. He has ruined my poor boy."At this Arthur Wardlaw began to shriek for mercy. "Oh, Mr. Penfold," saidhe, "you are a father and hate me. But think of my father. I'll sayanything, do anything. I'll clear Robert Penfold at my own expense. Ihave lost _her._ She loathes me now. Have mercy on me, and let me leavethe country!"He cringed and crawled so that he disarmed anger, and substitutedcontempt."Ay," said Burt. "He don't hit like you, Mr. Penfold; this is a chap thatought to have been in Newgate long ago. But take my advice; make himclear you on paper, and then let him go. I'll go downstairs awhile. Imustn't take part in compounding a felony.""Oh, yes, Robert," said Helen "for his father's sake.""Very well," said Robert. "Now, then, reptile, take the pen, and write inyour own hand, if you can."He took the pen, and wrote to dictation--"I, Arthur Wardlaw, confess that I forged the promissory note for 2,000pounds, and sent it to Robert Penfold, and that 1,400 pounds of it was tobe for my own use, and to pay my Oxford debts. And I confess that Ibribed Wylie to scuttle the ship _Proserpine_ in order to cheat theunderwriters."Penfold then turned to Wylie, and asked him the true motive of thisfraud."Why, the gold was aboard the _Shannon,_" said Wylie; "I playedhanky-panky with the metals in White's store.""Put that down," said Penfold. "Now go on.""Make a clean breast," said Wylie. "I have. Say as how you cooked the_Proserpine's_ log, and forged Hiram Hudson's writing.""And the newspaper extracts you sent me," said Helen, "and the lettersfrom Mr. Hand."Arthur groaned. "Must I tell all that?" said he."Every word, or be indicted," said Robert Penfold, sternly.He wrote it all down, and then sat staring stupidly. And the next thingwas, he gave a loud shriek, and fell on the floor in a fit. Theysprinkled water over him, and Burt conveyed him home in a cab, advisinghim to leave the country, but at the same time promising him not toexasperate those he had wronged so deeply, but rather to moderate them,if required. Then he gave Burt fifty guineas.Robert Penfold, at Helen's request, went with her to Mr. Hennessy, andwith the proofs of Arthur's guilt and Robert's innocence; and heundertook that the matter should go in proper form before the Secretaryof State. But, somehow, it transpired that the _Proserpine_ had beenscuttled, and several of the underwriters wrote to the Wardlaws tothreaten proceedings. Wardlaw senior returned but one answer to thesegentlemen: "Bring your proofs to me at my place of business next Mondayat twelve, and let me judge the case, before you go elsewhere.""That is high and mighty," said one or two; but they conferred, andagreed to these terms, so high stood the old merchant's name.They came; they were received with stiff courtesy. The deposition ofCooper and Welch was produced, and Wylie, kept up to the mark by Nancy,told the truth and laid his two thousand pounds intact down on the table."Now that is off my stomach," said he, "and I'm a man again.""Ay, and I'll marry you next week," said Nancy."Well, gentlemen," said old Wardlaw, "my course seems very clear. I willundo the whole transaction, and return you your money less the premiums,but plus five per cent. interest." And this he did on the spot, for thefirm was richer than ever.When they were gone, Robert Penfold came in and said, "I hear, sir, youdevote this day to repairing the wrongs done by your firm: what can youdo for me?" He laid a copy of Arthur's confession before him. The old manwinced a moment where he sat, and the iron passed through his soul. Itwas a long time before he could speak. At last he said, "This wrong isirreparable, I fear."Robert said nothing. Sore as his own heart was, he was not the one tostrike a grand old man, struggling so bravely against dishonor.Wardlaw senior touched his handbell."Request Mr. Penfold to step this way."Michael Penfold came."Gentlemen," said the old merchant, "the house of Wardlaw exists no more.It was built on honesty, and cannot survive a fraud. Wardlaw and Son werepartners at will. I had decided to dissolve that partnership, wind up theaccounts and put up the shutters. But now, if you like, I will value theeffects, and hand the business over to Penfold and Son on easy terms.Robert Penfold has been accused of forging John Wardlaw's name; to provethis was a calumny, I put Penfold over my door instead of Wardlaw. Thecity of London will understand that, gentlemen, believe me.""Mr. Wardlaw," said Robert, "you are a just, a noble--" He could say nomore."Ah, sir," said Michael, "if the young gentleman had only been like you!""Mention his name no more to me. His crime and his punishment have killedme.""Oh," said Robert, hastily, "he shall not be punished for your sake.""Not be punished? It is not in your hands to decide. God has punishedhim. He is insane.""Good Heavens!""Quite mad;--quite mad. Gentlemen, I can no longer support thisinterview. Send me your solicitor's address; the deeds shall be prepared.I wish the new firm success. Probity is the road to it. Good-day."He wound up the affairs, had his name and Arthur's painted out at his ownexpense, and directed the painters to paint the Penfolds' in at theirs;went home to Elmtrees, and died in three days. He died lamented andhonored, and Robert Penfold was much affected. He got it into his headthat he had killed him with Arthur's confession, putting it before him sosuddenly. "I have forgotten who said 'Vengeance is mine,'" said RobertPenfold.The merchant priest left the office to be conducted by his father; heused the credit of the new firm to purchase a living in the Vale of Kent;and thither he retired, grateful to Providence, but not easy in hisconscience. He now accused himself of having often distrusted God, andseen his fellow creatures in too dark a light. He turned toward religionand the care of souls.Past suffering enlightens a man, and makes him tender; and people soonbegan to walk and drive considerable distances to hear the new vicar. Hehad a lake with a peninsula, the shape of which he altered, at a greatexpense, as soon as he came there. He wrote to Helen every day, and sheto him. Neither could do anything _con amore_ till the post came in.One afternoon as he was preaching with great unction, he saw a longpuritanical face looking up at him with a droll expression of amazementand half-irony. The stranger called on him and began at once. "Wal,parson, you are a buster, you air. You ginn it us hot--_you_ did. I'mdarned if I ain't kinder ashamed to talk of this world's goods to a saintupon airth like you. But I never knowed a parson yet as couldn't collarthe dollars."After this preamble he announced that he had got a lease of the islandfrom Chili, dug a lot of silver plate out of the galleon, sold ten tonsof choice coral, and a ship-load of cassia and cocoanuts. He had thendisposed of his lease to a Californian company for a large sum. And hispartner's share of net profits came to 17,247 pounds 13s. 3 1/2 d. whichsum he had paid to Michael, for Robert, Penfold in drafts on Baring, atthirty days after sight.Robert shook his hand, and thanked him sincerely for his ability andprobity. He stayed that night at the Vicarage, and by that means fell inwith another acquaintance. General Rolleston and his daughter drove downto see the parsonage. Helen wanted to surprise Robert; and, as oftenhappens, she surprised herself. She made him show her everything; and sohe took her on to his peninsula. Lo! the edges of it had been cut andaltered, so that it presented a miniature copy of Godsend Island.As soon as she saw this, Helen turned round with a sudden cry of love,"Oh, Robert!" and the lovers were in each other's arms. "What could anyother man ever be to me?""And what could any other woman ever be to me?"They knew that before. But this miniature island made them speak out andsay it. The wedding-day was fixed before she left.Her majesty pardoned this scholar, hero, and worthy, the crime he hadnever committed.Nancy Rouse took the penitent Wylie without the 2,000 pounds. But oldPenfold, who knew the whole story, lent the money at three per cent; sothe Wylies pay a ground-rent of 60 pounds a year for a property which, byMrs. Wylie's industry and judgment, is worth at least 400 pounds. Shepays this very cheerfully, and appeals to Joe whether that is not betterthan the other way."Why, Joe," says she, "to a woman like me, that's a-foot all day, 'tisworth sixty pounds a year to be a good sleeper; and I shouldn't be thatif I had wronged my neighbor."Arthur Wardlaw is in a private lunatic asylum, and is taken great careof. In his lucid intervals he suffers horrible distress of mind; but,though sad to see, these agonies furnish the one hope of his ultimaterecovery. When not troubled by these returns of reason, he is contentedenough. His favorite employment is to get Mr. Undercliff's fac-similes,and to write love-letters to Helen Rolleston which are duly deposited inthe post-office _of the establishment._ These letters are in thehandwriting of Charles I., Paoli, Lord Bacon, Alexander Pope, LordChesterfield, Nelson, Lord Shaftesbury, Addison, the late Duke ofWellington, and so on. And, strange to say, the Greek e never appears inany of them. They are admirably like, though the matter is not alwaysequally consistent with the characters of those personages.Helen Rolleston married Robert Penfold. On the wedding-day, the presentswere laid out, and among them there was a silver box incrusted withcoral. Female curiosity demanded that this box should be opened. Helenobjected, but her bridesmaids rebelled; the whole company sided withthem, and Robert smiled a careless assent. A blacksmith and carpenterwere both enlisted, and with infinite difficulty the poor box was rivenopen.Inside was another box, locked, but with no key. That was opened withcomparative ease, and then handed to the bride. It contained nothing butPapal indulgences and rough stones, and fair throats were opened in somedisappointment. A lady, however, of more experience, examined thecontents, and said, that, in her opinion, many of them were uncut gems ofgreat price; there was certainly a quantity of jaspers and blood-stones,and others of no value at all. "But look at these two pearl-shapeddiamonds," said she; "why, they are a little fortune! and oh!" The stonethat struck this fair creature dumb was a rough ruby as big as ablackbird's egg, and of amazing depth and fire. "No lady in England,"said she, "has a ruby to compare with this."The information proved correct. The box furnished Helen with diamonds andemeralds of great thickness and quality. But the huge ruby placed her ona level with sovereigns. She wears it now and then in London, but notoften. It attracts too much attention, blazing on her fair forehead likea star, and eclipses everything.Well, what her ruby is among stones she is among wives. And he is worthyof her. Through much injustice, suffering, danger, and trouble, they havepassed to health, happiness, and peace, and that entire union of twonoble hearts, in loyal friendship and wedded love, which is the truestbliss this earth affords.End of Project Gutenberg's Foul Play, by Charles Reade and Dion Boucicault*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FOUL PLAY ******** This file should be named 3702.txt or 3702.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/7/0/3702/Produced by James Rusk.

HornungContents  Out of Paradise  The Chest of Silver  The Rest Cure  The Criminologists' Club  The Field of Phillipi  A Bad Night  A Trap to Catch a Cracksman  The Spoils of Sacrilege  The Raffles RelicsOut of ParadiseIf I must tell more tales of Raffles, I can but back to our earliestdays together, and fill in the blanks left by discretion in existingannals.  In so doing I may indeed fill some small part of an infinitelygreater blank, across which you may conceive me to have stretched mycanvas for the first frank portrait of my friend.  The whole truthcannot harm him now.  I shall paint in every wart.  Raffles was avillain, when all is written; it is no service to his memory to glazethe fact; yet I have done so myself before to-day.  I have omittedwhole heinous episodes.  I have dwelt unduly on the redeeming side.And this I may do again, blinded even as I write by the gallant glamourthat made my villain more to me than any hero.  But at least thereshall be no more reservations, and as an earnest I shall make nofurther secret of the greatest wrong that even Raffles ever did me.I pick my words with care and pain, loyal as I still would be to myfriend, and yet remembering as I must those Ides of March when he ledme blindfold into temptation and crime.  That was an ugly office, ifyou will.  It was a moral bagatelle to the treacherous trick he was toplay me a few weeks later.  The second offence, on the other hand, wasto prove the less serious of the two against society, and might initself have been published to the world years ago.  There have beenprivate reasons for my reticence.  The affair was not only toointimately mine, and too discreditable to Raffles.  One other wasinvolved in it, one dearer to me than Raffles himself, one whose nameshall not even now be sullied by association with ours.Suffice it that I had been engaged to her before that mad March deed.True, her people called it "an understanding," and frowned even uponthat, as well they might.  But their authority was not direct; we bowedto it as an act of politic grace; between us, all was well but myunworthiness.  That may be gauged when I confess that this was how thematter stood on the night I gave a worthless check for my losses atbaccarat, and afterward turned to Raffles in my need.  Even after thatI saw her sometimes.  But I let her guess that there was more upon mysoul than she must ever share, and at last I had written to end it all.I remember that week so well!  It was the close of such a May as we hadnever had since, and I was too miserable even to follow the heavyscoring in the papers.  Raffles was the only man who could get a wicketup at Lord's, and I never once went to see him play.  AgainstYorkshire, however, he helped himself to a hundred runs as well; andthat brought Raffles round to me, on his way home to the Albany."We must dine and celebrate the rare event," said he.  "A century takesit out of one at my time of life; and you, Bunny, you look quite asmuch in need of your end of a worthy bottle.  Suppose we make it theCaf? Royal, and eight sharp?   I'll be there first to fix up the tableand the wine."And at the Caf? Royal I incontinently told him of the trouble I was in.It was the first he had ever heard of my affair, and I told him all,though not before our bottle had been succeeded by a pint of the sameexemplary brand.  Raffles heard me out with grave attention.  Hissympathy was the more grateful for the tactful brevity with which itwas indicated rather than expressed.  He only wished that I had toldhim of this complication in the beginning; as I had not, he agreed withme that the only course was a candid and complete renunciation.  It wasnot as though my divinity had a penny of her own, or I could earn anhonest one.  I had explained to Raffles that she was an orphan, whospent most of her time with an aristocratic aunt in the country, andthe remainder under the repressive roof of a pompous politician inPalace Gardens.  The aunt had, I believed, still a sneaking softnessfor me, but her illustrious brother had set his face against me fromthe first."Hector Carruthers!" murmured Raffles, repeating the detested name withhis clear, cold eye on mine.  "I suppose you haven't seen much of him?""Not a thing for ages," I replied.  "I was at the house two or threedays last year, but they've neither asked me since nor been at home tome when I've called.  The old beast seems a judge of men."And I laughed bitterly in my glass."Nice house?" said Raffles, glancing at himself in his silvercigarette-case."Top shelf," said I.  "You know the houses in Palace Gardens, don'tyou?""Not so well as I should like to know them, Bunny.""Well, it's about the most palatial of the lot.  The old ruffian is asrich as Croesus.  It's a country-place in town.""What about the window-fastenings?" asked Raffles casually.I recoiled from the open cigarette-case that he proffered as he spoke.Our eyes met; and in his there was that starry twinkle of mirth andmischief, that sunny beam of audacious devilment, which had been myundoing two months before, which was to undo me as often as he choseuntil the chapter's end.  Yet for once I withstood its glamour; foronce I turned aside that luminous glance with front of steel.  Therewas no need for Raffles to voice his plans.  I read them all betweenthe strong lines of his smiling, eager face.  And I pushed back mychair in the equal eagerness of my own resolve."Not if I know it!" said I.  "A house I've dined in--a house I've seen her in--a house where she stays by the month together!  Don'tput it into words, Raffles, or I'll get up and go.""You mustn't do that before the coffee and liqueur," said Raffleslaughing.  "Have a small Sullivan first: it's the royal road to acigar.  And now let me observe that your scruples would do you honor ifold Carruthers still lived in the house in question.""Do you mean to say he doesn't?"Raffles struck a match, and handed it first to me.  "I mean to say, mydear Bunny, that Palace Gardens knows the very name no more.  You beganby telling me you had heard nothing of these people all this year.That's quite enough to account for our little misunderstanding. I wasthinking of the house, and you were thinking of the people in thehouse.""But who are they, Raffles?  Who has taken the house, if old Carruthershas moved, and how do you know that it is still worth a visit?""In answer to your first question--Lord Lochmaben," replied Raffles,blowing bracelets of smoke toward the ceiling.  "You look as though youhad never heard of him; but as the cricket and racing are the only partof your paper that you condescend to read, you can't be expected tokeep track of all the peers created in your time.  Your other questionis not worth answering.  How do you suppose that I know these things?It's my business to get to know them, and that's all there is to it.As a matter of fact, Lady Lochmaben has just as good diamonds as Mrs.Carruthers ever had; and the chances are that she keeps them where Mrs.Carruthers kept hers, if you could enlighten me on that point."As it happened, I could, since I knew from his niece that it was one onwhich Mr. Carruthers had been a faddist in his time.  He had made quitea study of the cracksman's craft, in a resolve to circumvent it withhis own.  I remembered myself how the ground-floor windows wereelaborately bolted and shuttered, and how the doors of all the roomsopening upon the square inner hall were fitted with extra Yale locks,at an unlikely height, not to be discovered by one within the room.  Ithad been the butler's business to turn and to collect all these keysbefore retiring for the night.  But the key of the safe in the studywas supposed to be in the jealous keeping of the master of the househimself.  That safe was in its turn so ingeniously hidden that I nevershould have found it for myself.  I well remember how one who showed itto me (in the innocence of her heart) laughed as she assured me thateven her little trinkets were solemnly locked up in it every night.  Ithad been let into the wall behind one end of the book-case, expresslyto preserve the barbaric splendor of Mrs. Carruthers; without a doubtthese Lochmabens would use it for the same purpose; and in the alteredcircumstances I had no hesitation in giving Raffles all the informationhe desired.  I even drew him a rough plan of the ground-floor on theback of my menu-card."It was rather clever of you to notice the kind of locks on the innerdoors," he remarked as he put it in his pocket.  "I suppose you don'tremember if it was a Yale on the front door as well?""It was not," I was able to answer quite promptly.  "I happen to knowbecause I once had the key when--when we went to a theatre together.""Thank you, old chap," said Raffles sympathetically.  "That's all Ishall want from you, Bunny, my boy.  There's no night like to-night!"It was one of his sayings when bent upon his worst.  I looked at himaghast.  Our cigars were just in blast, yet already he was signallingfor his bill.  It was impossible to remonstrate with him until we wereboth outside in the street."I'm coming with you," said I, running my arm through his."Nonsense, Bunny!""Why is it nonsense?  I know every inch of the ground, and since thehouse has changed hands I have no compunction.  Besides, 'I have beenthere' in the other sense as well: once a thief, you know!  In for apenny, in for a pound!"It was ever my mood when the blood was up.  But my old friend failed toappreciate the characteristic as he usually did.  We crossed RegentStreet in silence.  I had to catch his sleeve to keep a hand in hisinhospitable arm."I really think you had better stay away," said Raffles as we reachedthe other curb.  "I've no use for you this time.""Yet I thought I had been so useful up to now?""That may be, Bunny, but I tell you frankly I don't want you to-night.""Yet I know the ground and you don't!  I tell you what," said I: "I'llcome just to show you the ropes, and I won't take a pennyweight of theswag."Such was the teasing fashion in which he invariably prevailed upon me;it was delightful to note how it caused him to yield in his turn. ButRaffles had the grace to give in with a laugh, whereas I too often lostmy temper with my point."You little rabbit!" he chuckled.  "You shall have your share, whetheryou come or not; but, seriously, don't you think you might remember thegirl?""What's the use?" I groaned.  "You agree there is nothing for it but togive her up.  I am glad to say that for myself before I asked you, andwrote to tell her so on Sunday.  Now it's Wednesday, and she hasn'tanswered by line or sign.  It's waiting for one word from her that'sdriving me mad.""Perhaps you wrote to Palace Gardens?""No, I sent it to the country.  There's been time for an answer,wherever she may be."We had reached the Albany, and halted with one accord at the Piccadillyportico, red cigar to red cigar."You wouldn't like to go and see if the answer's in your rooms?" heasked."No.  What's the good?  Where's the point in giving her up if I'm goingto straighten out when it's too late?  It is too late, I have given herup, and I am coming with you!"The hand that bowled the most puzzling ball in England (once it foundits length) descended on my shoulder with surprising promptitude."Very well, Bunny!  That's finished; but your blood be on your own pateif evil comes of it.  Meanwhile we can't do better than turn in heretill you have finished your cigar as it deserves, and topped up withsuch a cup of tea as you must learn to like if you hope to get on inyour new profession.  And when the hours are small enough, Bunny, myboy, I don't mind admitting I shall be very glad to have you with me."I have a vivid memory of the interim in his rooms.  I think it musthave been the first and last of its kind that I was called upon tosustain with so much knowledge of what lay before me.  I passed thetime with one restless eye upon the clock, and the other on theTantalus which Raffles ruthlessly declined to unlock.  He admitted thatit was like waiting with one's pads on; and in my slender experience ofthe game of which he was a world's master, that was an ordeal not to beendured without a general quaking of the inner man.  I was, on theother hand, all right when I got to the metaphorical wicket; and halfthe surprises that Raffles sprung on me were doubtless due to his earlyrecognition of the fact.On this occasion I fell swiftly and hopelessly out of love with theprospect I had so gratuitously embraced.  It was not only my repugnanceto enter that house in that way, which grew upon my better judgment asthe artificial enthusiasm of the evening evaporated from my veins.Strong as that repugnance became, I had an even stronger feeling thatwe were embarking on an important enterprise far too much upon the spurof the moment.  The latter qualm I had the temerity to confess toRaffles; nor have I often loved him more than when he freely admittedit to be the most natural feeling in the world.  He assured me,however, that he had had my Lady Lochmaben and her jewels in his mindfor several months; he had sat behind them at first nights; and longago determined what to take or to reject; in fine, he had only beenwaiting for those topographical details which it had been my chanceprivilege to supply.  I now learned that he had numerous houses in asimilar state upon his list; something or other was wanting in eachcase in order to complete his plans.  In that of the Bond Streetjeweller it was a trusty accomplice; in the present instance, a moreintimate knowledge of the house.  And lastly, this was a Wednesdaynight, when the tired legislator gets early to his bed.How I wish I could make the whole world see and hear him, and smell thesmoke of his beloved Sullivan, as he took me into these, the secrets ofhis infamous trade!  Neither look nor language would betray the infamy.As a mere talker, I shall never listen to the like of Raffles on thisside of the sod; and his talk was seldom garnished by an oath, never inmy remembrance by the unclean word. Then he looked like a man who haddressed to dine out, not like one who had long since dined; for hiscurly hair, though longer that another's, was never untidy in itslength; and these were the days when it was still as black as ink.  Norwere there many lines as yet upon the smooth and mobile face; and itsframe was still that dear den of disorder and good taste, with thecarved book-case, the dresser and chests of still older oak, and theWattses and Rossettis hung anyhow on the walls.It must have been one o'clock before we drove in a hansom as far asKensington Church, instead of getting down at the gates of our privateroad to ruin.  Constitutionally shy of the direct approach, Raffles wasfurther deterred by a ball in full swing at the Empress Rooms, whencepotential witnesses were pouring between dances into the cool desertedstreet.  Instead he led me a little way up Church Street, and sothrough the narrow passage into Palace Gardens.  He knew the house aswell as I did.  We made our first survey from the other side of theroad.  And the house was not quite in darkness; there was a dim lightover the door, a brighter one in the stables, which stood still fartherback from the road."That's a bit of a bore," said Raffles.  "The ladies have been outsomewhere--trust them to spoil the show!  They would get to bed beforethe stable folk, but insomnia is the curse of their sex and ourprofession.  Somebody's not home yet; that will be the son of thehouse; but he's a beauty, who may not come home at all.""Another Alick Carruthers," I murmured, recalling the one I liked leastof all the household, as I remembered it."They might be brothers," rejoined Raffles, who knew all the loose fishabout town.  "Well, I'm not sure that I shall want you after all,Bunny.""Why not?""If the front door's only on the latch, and you're right about thelock, I shall walk in as though I were the son of the house myself."And he jingled the skeleton bunch that he carried on a chain as honestmen carry their latchkeys."You forget the inner doors and the safe.""True.  You might be useful to me there.  But I still don't likeleading you in where it isn't absolutely necessary, Bunny.""Then let me lead you, I answered, and forthwith marched across thebroad, secluded road, with the great houses standing back on eitherside in their ample gardens, as though the one opposite belonged to me.I thought Raffles had stayed behind, for I never heard him at my heels,yet there he was when I turned round at the gate."I must teach you the step," he whispered, shaking his head.  "Youshouldn't use your heel at all.  Here's a grass border for you: walk itas you would the plank!  Gravel makes a noise, and flower-beds tell atale.  Wait--I must carry you across this."It was the sweep of the drive, and in the dim light from above thedoor, the soft gravel, ploughed into ridges by the night's wheels,threatened an alarm at every step.  Yet Raffles, with me in his arms,crossed the zone of peril softly as the pard."Shoes in your pocket--that's the beauty of pumps!" he whispered on thestep; his light bunch tinkled faintly; a couple of keys he stooped andtried, with the touch of a humane dentist; the third let us into theporch.  And as we stood together on the mat, as he was graduallyclosing the door, a clock within chimed a half-hour in fashion sothrillingly familiar to me that I caught Raffles by the arm.  Myhalf-hours of happiness had flown to just such chimes! I looked wildlyabout me in the dim light.  Hat-stand and oak settee belonged equallyto my past.  And Raffles was smiling in my face as he held the doorwide for my escape."You told me a lie!" I gasped in whispers."I did nothing of the sort," he replied.  "The furniture's thefurniture of Hector Carruthers; but the house is the house of LordLochmaben.  Look here!"He had stooped, and was smoothing out the discarded envelope of atelegram.  "Lord Lochmaben," I read in pencil by the dim light; and thecase was plain to me on the spot.  My friends had let their house,furnished, as anybody but Raffles would have explained to me in thebeginning."All right," I said.  "Shut the door."And he not only shut it without a sound, but drew a bolt that mighthave been sheathed in rubber.In another minute we were at work upon the study-door, I with the tinylantern and the bottle of rock-oil, he with the brace and the largestbit.  The Yale lock he had given up at a glance.  It was placed high upin the door, feet above the handle, and the chain of holes with whichRaffles had soon surrounded it were bored on a level with his eyes.Yet the clock in the hall chimed again, and two ringing strokesresounded through the silent house before we gained admittance to theroom.Raffle's next care was to muffle the bell on the shuttered window (witha silk handkerchief from the hat-stand) and to prepare an emergencyexit by opening first the shutters and then the window itself.  Luckilyit was a still night, and very little wind came in to embarrass us.  Hethen began operations on the safe, revealed by me behind its foldingscreen of books, while I stood sentry on the threshold.  I may havestood there for a dozen minutes, listening to the loud hall clock andto the gentle dentistry of Raffles in the mouth of the safe behind me,when a third sound thrilled my every nerve.  It was the equallycautious opening of a door in the gallery overhead.I moistened my lips to whisper a word of warning to Raffles.  But hisears had been as quick as mine, and something longer.  His lanterndarkened as I turned my head; next moment I felt his breath upon theback of my neck.  It was now too late even for a whisper, and quite outof the question to close the mutilated door.  There we could onlystand, I on the threshold, Raffles at my elbow, while one carrying acandle crept down the stairs.The study-door was at right angles to the lowest flight, and just tothe right of one alighting in the hall.  It was thus impossible for usto see who it was until the person was close abreast of us; but by therustle of the gown we knew that it was one of the ladies, and dressedjust as she had come from theatre or ball.  Insensibly I drew back asthe candle swam into our field of vision: it had not traversed manyinches when a hand was clapped firmly but silently across my mouth.I could forgive Raffles for that, at any rate!  In another breath Ishould have cried aloud: for the girl with the candle, the girl in herball-dress, at dead of night, the girl with the letter for the post,was the last girl on God's wide earth whom I should have chosen thus toencounter--a midnight intruder in the very house where I had beenreluctantly received on her account!I forgot Raffles.  I forgot the new and unforgivable grudge I hadagainst him now.  I forgot his very hand across my mouth, even beforehe paid me the compliment of removing it.  There was the only girl inall the world: I had eyes and brains for no one and for nothing else.She had neither seen nor heard us, had looked neither to the right handnor the left.  But a small oak table stood on the opposite side of thehall; it was to this table that she went.  On it was one of those boxesin which one puts one's letters for the post; and she stooped to readby her candle the times at which this box was cleared.The loud clock ticked and ticked.  She was standing at her full heightnow, her candle on the table, her letter in both hands, and in herdowncast face a sweet and pitiful perplexity that drew the tears to myeyes.  Through a film I saw her open the envelope so lately sealed andread her letter once more, as though she would have altered it a littleat the last.  It was too late for that; but of a sudden she plucked arose from her bosom, and was pressing it in with her letter when Igroaned aloud.How could I help it?  The letter was for me: of that I was as sure asthough I had been looking over her shoulder.  She was as true astempered steel; there were not two of us to whom she wrote and sentroses at dead of night.  It was her one chance of writing to me. Nonewould know that she had written.  And she cared enough to soften thereproaches I had richly earned, with a red rose warm from her own warmheart.  And there, and there was I, a common thief who had broken in tosteal!  Yet I was unaware that I had uttered a sound until she lookedup, startled, and the hands behind me pinned me where I stood.I think she must have seen us, even in the dim light of the solitarycandle.  Yet not a sound escaped her as she peered courageously in ourdirection; neither did one of us move; but the hall clock went on andon, every tick like the beat of a drum to bring the house about ourears, until a minute must have passed as in some breathless dream.  Andthen came the awakening--with such a knocking and a ringing at thefront door as brought all three of us to our senses on the spot."The son of the house!" whispered Raffles in my ear, as he dragged meback to the window he had left open for our escape.  But as he leapedout first a sharp cry stopped me at the sill.  "Get back! Get back!We're trapped!" he cried; and in the single second that I stood there,I saw him fell one officer to the ground, and dart across the lawn withanother at his heels.  A third came running up to the window.  Whatcould I do but double back into the house?  And there in the hall I metmy lost love face to face.Till that moment she had not recognized me.  I ran to catch her as sheall but fell.  And my touch repelled her into life, so that she shookme off, and stood gasping: "You, of all men!  You, of all men!" until Icould bear it no more, but broke again for the study-window. "Not thatway--not that way!" she cried in an agony at that.  Her hands were uponme now.  "In there, in there," she whispered, pointing and pulling meto a mere cupboard under the stairs, where hats and coats were hung;and it was she who shut the door on me with a sob.Doors were already opening overhead, voices calling, voices answering,the alarm running like wildfire from room to room.  Soft feet patteredin the gallery and down the stairs about my very ears. I do not knowwhat made me put on my own shoes as I heard them, but I think that Iwas ready and even longing to walk out and give myself up.  I need notsay what and who it was that alone restrained me.  I heard her name.  Iheard them crying to her as though she had fainted.  I recognized thedetested voice of my bete noir, Alick Carruthers, thick as might beexpected of the dissipated dog, yet daring to stutter out her name.And then I heard, without catching, her low reply; it was in answer tothe somewhat stern questioning of quite another voice; and from whatfollowed I knew that she had never fainted at all."Upstairs, miss, did he?  Are you sure?"I did not hear her answer.  I conceive her as simply pointing up thestairs.  In any case, about my very ears once more, there now followedsuch a patter and tramp of bare and booted feet as renewed in me a basefear for my own skin.  But voices and feet passed over my head, went upand up, higher and higher; and I was wondering whether or not to make adash for it, when one light pair came running down again, and in verydespair I marched out to meet my preserver, looking as little as Icould like the abject thing I felt."Be quick!" she cried in a harsh whisper, and pointed peremptorily tothe porch.But I stood stubbornly before her, my heart hardened by her hardness,and perversely indifferent to all else.  And as I stood I saw theletter she had written, in the hand with which she pointed, crushedinto a ball."Quickly!" She stamped her foot.  "Quickly--if you ever cared!"This in a whisper, without bitterness, without contempt, but with asudden wild entreaty that breathed upon the dying embers of my poormanhood.  I drew myself together for the last time in her sight.  Iturned, and left her as she wished--for her sake, not for mine.  And asI went I heard her tearing her letter into little pieces, and thelittle pieces falling on the floor.Then I remembered Raffles, and could have killed him for what he haddone.  Doubtless by this time he was safe and snug in the Albany: whatdid my fate matter to him?  Never mind; this should be the end betweenhim and me as well; it was the end of everything, this dark night'swork!  I would go and tell him so.  I would jump into a cab and drivethere and then to his accursed rooms.  But first I must escape from thetrap in which he had been so ready to leave me.  And on the very stepsI drew back in despair.  They were searching the shrubberies betweenthe drive and the road; a policeman's lantern kept flashing in and outamong the laurels, while a young man in evening-clothes directed himfrom the gravel sweep.  It was this young man whom I must dodge, but atmy first step in the gravel he wheeled round, and it was Raffleshimself."Hulloa!" he cried.  "So you've come up to join the dance as well! Hada look inside, have you?  You'll be better employed in helping to drawthe cover in front here.  It's all right, officer--only anothergentleman from the Empress Rooms."And we made a brave show of assisting in the futile search, until thearrival of more police, and a broad hint from an irritable sergeant,gave us an excellent excuse for going off arm-in-arm. But it wasRaffles who had thrust his arm through mine.  I shook him off as weleft the scene of shame behind."My dear Bunny!" he exclaimed.  "Do you know what brought me back?"I answered savagely that I neither knew nor cared."I had the very devil of a squeak for it," he went on.  "I did thehurdles over two or three garden-walls, but so did the flyer who was onmy tracks, and he drove me back into the straight and down to HighStreet like any lamplighter.  If he had only had the breath to sing outit would have been all up with me then; as it was I pulled off my coatthe moment I was round the corner, and took a ticket for it at theEmpress Rooms.""I suppose you had one for the dance that was going on," I growled. Norwould it have been a coincidence for Raffles to have had a ticket forthat or any other entertainment of the London season."I never asked what the dance was," he returned.  "I merely took theopportunity of revising my toilet, and getting rid of that ratherdistinctive overcoat, which I shall call for now.  They're not tooparticular at such stages of such proceedings, but I've no doubt Ishould have seen someone I knew if I had none right in.  I might evenhave had a turn, if only I had been less uneasy about you, Bunny.""It was like you to come back to help me out," said I.  "But to lie tome, and to inveigle me with your lies into that house of allhouses--that was not like you, Raffles--and I never shall forgive it oryou!"Raffles took my arm again.  We were near the High Street gates ofPalace Gardens, and I was too miserable to resist an advance which Imeant never to give him an opportunity to repeat."Come, come, Bunny, there wasn't much inveigling about it," said he. "Idid my level best to leave you behind, but you wouldn't listen to me.""If you had told me the truth I should have listened fast enough," Iretorted.  "But what's the use of talking?  You can boast of your ownadventures after you bolted.  You don't care what happened to me.""I cared so much that I came back to see.""You might have spared yourself the trouble!  The wrong had been done.Raffles--Raffles--don't you know who she was?"It was my hand that gripped his arm once more."I guessed," he answered, gravely enough even for me."It was she who saved me, not you," I said.  "And that is the bitterestpart of all!"Yet I told him that part with a strange sad pride in her whom I hadlost--through him--forever.  As I ended we turned into High Street; inthe prevailing stillness, the faint strains of the band reached us fromthe Empress Rooms; and I hailed a crawling hansom as Raffles turnedthat way."Bunny," said he, "it's no use saying I'm sorry.  Sorrow adds insult ina case like this--if ever there was or will be such another! Onlybelieve me, Bunny, when I swear to you that I had not the smallestshadow of a suspicion that she was in the house."And in my heart of hearts I did believe him; but I could not bringmyself to say the words."You told me yourself that you had written to her in the country," hepursued."And that letter!" I rejoined, in a fresh wave of bitterness: "thatletter she had written at dead of night, and stolen down to post, itwas the one I have been waiting for all these days!  I should have gotit to-morrow.  Now I shall never get it, never hear from her again, norhave another chance in this world or in the next. I don't say it wasall your fault.  You no more knew that she was there than I did.  Butyou told me a deliberate lie about her people, and that I never shallforgive."I spoke as vehemently as I could under my breath.  The hansom waswaiting at the curb."I can say no more than I have said," returned Raffles with a shrug."Lie or no lie, I didn't tell it to bring you with me, but to get youto give me certain information without feeling a beast about it. But,as a matter of fact, it was no lie about old Hector Carruthers and LordLochmaben, and anybody but you would have guessed the truth.""'What is the truth?""I as good as told you, Bunny, again and again.""Then tell me now.""If you read your paper there would be no need; but if you want toknow, old Carruthers headed the list of the Birthday Honors, and LordLochmaben is the title of his choice."And this miserable quibble was not a lie!  My lip curled, I turned myback without a word, and drove home to my Mount Street flat in a newfury of savage scorn.  Not a lie, indeed!  It was the one that is halfa truth, the meanest lie of all, and the very last to which I couldhave dreamt that Raffles would stoop.  So far there had been a degreeof honor between us, if only of the kind understood to obtain betweenthief and thief.  Now all that was at an end. Raffles had cheated me.Raffles had completed the ruin of my life. I was done with Raffles, asshe who shall not be named was done with me.And yet, even while I blamed him most bitterly, and utterly abominatedhis deceitful deed, I could not but admit in my heart that the resultwas put of all proportion to the intent: he had never dreamt of doingme this injury, or indeed any injury at all. Intrinsically the deceithad been quite venial, the reason for it obviously the reason thatRaffles had given me.  It was quite true that he had spoken of thisLochmaben peerage as a new creation, and of the heir to it in a fashiononly applicable to Alick Carruthers.  He had given me hints, which Ihad been too dense to take, and he had certainly made more than oneattempt to deter me from accompanying him on this fatal emprise; had hebeen more explicit, I might have made it my business to deter him.  Icould not say in my heart that Raffles had failed to satisfy such honoras I might reasonably expect to subsist between us.  Yet it seems to meto require a superhuman sanity always and unerringly to separate causefrom effect, achievement from intent.  And I, for one, was never quiteable to do so in this case.I could not be accused of neglecting my newspaper during the next fewwretched days.  I read every word that I could find about the attemptedjewel-robbery in Palace Gardens, and the reports afforded me my solecomfort.  In the first place, it was only an attempted robbery; nothinghad been taken, after all.  And then--and then--the one member of thehousehold who had come nearest to a personal encounter with either ofus was unable to furnish any description of the man--had even expresseda doubt as to the likelihood of identification in the event of anarrest!I will not say with what mingled feelings I read and dwelt on thatannouncement It kept a certain faint glow alive within me until themorning brought me back the only presents I had ever made her.  Theywere books; jewellery had been tabooed by the authorities.  And thebooks came back without a word, though the parcel was directed in herhand.I had made up my mind not to go near Raffles again, but in my heart Ialready regretted my resolve.  I had forfeited love, I had sacrificedhonor, and now I must deliberately alienate myself from the one beingwhose society might yet be some recompense for all that I had lost.The situation was aggravated by the state of my exchequer.  I expectedan ultimatum from my banker by every post. Yet this influence wasnothing to the other.  It was Raffles I loved. It was not the dark lifewe led together, still less its base rewards; it was the man himself,his gayety, his humor, his dazzling audacity, his incomparable courageand resource.  And a very horror of turning to him again in mere needof greed set the seal on my first angry resolution.  But the anger wassoon gone out of me, and when at length Raffles bridged the gap bycoming to me, I rose to greet him almost with a shout.He came as though nothing had happened; and, indeed, not very many dayshad passed, though they might have been months to me.  Yet I fanciedthe gaze that watched me through our smoke a trifle less sunny than ithad been before.  And it was a relief to me when he came with fewpreliminaries to the inevitable point."Did you ever hear from her, Bunny?" he asked."In a way," I answered.  "We won't talk about it, if you don't mind,Raffles.""That sort of way!" he exclaimed.  He seemed both surprised anddisappointed."Yes," I said, "that sort of way.  It's finished.  What did you expect?""I don't know," said Raffles.  "I only thought that the girl who wentso far to get a fellow out of a tight place might go a little fartherto keep him from getting into another.""I don't see why she should," said I, honestly enough, yet with theirritation of a less just feeling deep down in my inmost consciousness."Yet you did hear from her?" he persisted."She sent me back my poor presents, without a word," I said, "if youcall that hearing."I could not bring myself to own to Raffles that I had given her onlybooks.  He asked if I was sure that she had sent them back herself; andthat was his last question.  My answer was enough for him.  And to thisday I cannot say whether it was more in relief than in regret that helaid a hand upon my shoulder."So you are out of Paradise after all!" said Raffles.  "I was not sure,or I should have come round before.  Well, Bunny, if they don't wantyou there, there's a little Inferno in the Albany where you will be aswelcome as ever."And still, with all the magic mischief of his smile, there was thattouch of sadness which I was yet to read aright.The Chest of SilverLike all the tribe of which I held him head, Raffles professed theliveliest disdain for unwieldy plunder of any description; it might beold Sheffield, or it might be solid silver or gold, but if the thingwas not to be concealed about the person, he would none whatever of it.Unlike the rest of us, however, in this as in all else, Raffles wouldnot infrequently allow the acquisitive spirit of the mere collector tosilence the dictates of professional prudence.  The old oak chests, andeven the mahogany wine-cooler, for which he had doubtless paid like anhonest citizen, were thus immovable with pieces of crested plate, whichhe had neither the temerity to use nor the hardihood to melt or sell.He could but gloat over them behind locked doors, as I used to tellhim, and at last one afternoon I caught him at it.  It was in the yearafter that of my novitiate, a halcyon period at the Albany, whenRaffles left no crib uncracked, and I played second-murderer everytime. I had called in response to a telegram in which he stated that hewas going out of town, and must say good-by to me before he went. And Icould only think that he was inspired by the same impulse toward thebronzed salvers and the tarnished teapots with which I found himsurrounded, until my eyes lit upon the enormous silver-chest into whichhe was fitting them one by one."Allow me, Bunny!  I shall take the liberty of locking both doorsbehind you and putting the key in my pocket," said Raffles, when he hadlet me in.  "Not that I mean to take you prisoner, my dear fellow; butthere are those of us who can turn keys from the outside, though it wasnever an accomplishment of mine.""Not Crawshay again?" I cried, standing still in my hat.Raffles regarded me with that tantalizing smile of his which might meannothing, yet which often meant so much; and in a flash I was convincedthat our most jealous enemy and dangerous rival, the doyen of an olderschool, had paid him yet another visit."That remains to be seen," was the measured reply; "and I for one havenot set naked eye on the fellow since I saw him off through that windowand left myself for dead on this very spot.  In fact, I imagined himcomfortably back in jail.""Not old Crawshay!" said I.  "He's far too good a man to be takentwice.  I should call him the very prince of professional cracksmen.""Should you?" said Raffles coldly, with as cold an eye looking intomine.  "Then you had better prepare to repel princes when I'm gone.""But gone where?" I asked, finding a corner for my hat and coat, andhelping myself to the comforts of the venerable dresser which was oneof our friend's greatest treasures.  "Where is it you are off to, andwhy are you taking this herd of white elephants with you?"Raffles bestowed the cachet of his smile on my description of hismotley plate.  He joined me in one of his favorite cigarettes, onlyshaking a superior head at his own decanter."One question at a time, Bunny," said he.  "In the first place, I amgoing to have these rooms freshened up with a potful of paint, theelectric light, and the telephone you've been at me about so long.""Good!" I cried.  "Then we shall be able to talk to each other day andnight!""And get overheard and run in for our pains?  I shall wait till you arerun in, I think," said Raffles cruelly.  "But the rest's a necessity:not that I love new paint or am pining for electric light, but forreasons which I will just breathe in your private ear, Bunny. You mustnot try to take them too seriously; but the fact is, there is just theleast bit of a twitter against me in this rookery of an Albany.  Itmust have been started by that tame old bird, Policeman Mackenzie; itisn't very bad as yet, but it needn't be that to reach my ears.  Well,it was open to me either to clear out altogether, and so confirmwhatever happened to be in the air, or to go off for a time, under somearrangement which would give the authorities ample excuse foroverhauling every inch of my rooms.  Which would you have done, Bunny?""Cleared out, while I could!" said I devoutly."So I should have thought," rejoined Raffles.  "Yet you see the meritof my plan.  I shall leave every mortal thing unlocked.""Except that," said I, kicking the huge oak case with the iron bandsand clamps, and the baize lining fast disappearing under heavy packagesbearing the shapes of urns and candelabra."That," replied Raffles, "is neither to go with me nor to remain here.""Then what do you propose to do with it?""You have your banking account, and your banker," he went on.  This wasperfectly true, though it was Raffles alone who had kept the one open,and enabled me to propitiate the other in moments of emergency."Well?""Well, pay in this bundle of notes this afternoon, and say you have hada great week at Liverpool and Lincoln; then ask them if they can dowith your silver while you run over to Paris for a merry Easter.  Ishould tell them it's rather heavy--a lot of old family stuff thatyou've a good mind to leave with them till you marry and settle down."I winced at this, but consented to the rest after a moment'sconsideration.  After all, and for more reasons that I need enumerate,it was a plausible tale enough.  And Raffles had no banker; it wasquite impossible for him to explain, across any single counter, thelarge sums of hard cash which did sometimes fall into his hands; and itmight well be that he had nursed my small account in view of the veryquandary which had now arisen.  On all grounds, it was impossible forme to refuse him, and I am still glad to remember that my assent wasgiven, on the whole, ungrudgingly."But when will the chest be ready for me," I merely asked, as I stuffedthe notes into my cigarette case.  "And how are we to get it out ofthis, in banking hours, without attracting any amount of attention atthis end?"Raffles gave me an approving nod."I'm glad to see you spot the crux so quickly, Bunny.  I have thoughtof your taking it round to your place first, under cloud of night; butwe are bound to be seen even so, and on the whole it would look farless suspicious in broad daylight.  It will take you some twelve orfifteen minutes to drive to your bank in a growler, so if you are herewith one at a quarter to ten to-morrow morning, that will exactly meetthe case.  But you must have a hansom this minute if you mean toprepare the way with those notes this afternoon!"It was only too like the Raffles of those days to dismiss a subject andmyself in the same breath, with a sudden nod, and a brief grasp of thehand he was already holding out for mine.  I had a great mind to takeanother of his cigarettes instead, for there were one or two points onwhich he had carefully omitted to enlighten me.  Thus, I had still tolearn the bare direction of his journey; and it was all that I could doto drag it from him as I stood buttoning my coat and gloves."Scotland," he vouchsafed at last."At Easter," I remarked."To learn the language," he explained.  "I have no tongue but my own,you see, but I try to make up for it by cultivating every shade ofthat.  Some of them have come in useful even to your knowledge, Bunny:what price my Cockney that night in St.  John's Wood?  I can keep up myend in stage Irish, real Devonshire, very fair Norfolk, and threedistinct Yorkshire dialects.  But my good Galloway Scots might bebetter, and I mean to make it so.""You still haven't told me where to write to you.""I'll write to you first, Bunny.""At least let me see you off," I urged at the door.  "I promise not tolook at your ticket if you tell me the train!""The eleven-fifty from Euston.""Then I'll be with you by quarter to ten."And I left him without further parley, reading his impatience in hisface.  Everything, to be sure, seemed clear enough without that fullerdiscussion which I loved and Raffles hated.  Yet I thought we might atleast have dined together, and in my heart I felt just the least bithurt, until it occurred to me as I drove to count the notes in mycigarette case.  Resentment was impossible after that. The sum ran wellinto three figures, and it was plain that Raffles meant me to have agood time in his absence.  So I told his lie with unction at my bank,and made due arrangements for the reception of his chest next morning.Then I repaired to our club, hoping he would drop in, and that we mightdine together after all.  In that I was disappointed.  It was nothing,however, to the disappointment awaiting me at the Albany, when Iarrived in my four-wheeler at the appointed hour next morning."Mr. Raffles 'as gawn, sir," said the porter, with a note of reproachin his confidential undertone.  The man was a favorite with Raffles,who used him and tipped him with consummate tact, and he knew me onlyless well."Gone!" I echoed aghast.  "Where on earth to?""Scotland, sir.""Already?""By the eleven-fifty lawst night.""Last night!  I thought he meant eleven-fifty this morning!""He knew you did, sir, when you never came, and he told me to tell youthere was no such train."I could have rent my garments in mortification and annoyance withmyself and Raffles.  It was as much his fault as mine.  But for hisindecent haste in getting rid of me, his characteristic abruptness atthe end, there would have been no misunderstanding or mistake."Any other message?" I inquired morosely."Only about the box, sir.  Mr. Raffles said as you was goin' to takechawge of it time he's away, and I've a friend ready to lend a 'and ingetting it on the cab.  It's a rare 'eavy 'un, but Mr. Raffles an' mecould lift it all right between us, so I dessay me an' my friend can."For my own part, I must confess that its weight concerned me less thanthe vast size of that infernal chest, as I drove with it past club andpark at ten o'clock in the morning.  Sit as far back as I might in thefour-wheeler, I could conceal neither myself nor my connection with thehuge iron-clamped case upon the roof: in my heated imagination its woodwas glass through which all the world could see the guilty contents.Once an officious constable held up the traffic at our approach, andfor a moment I put a blood-curdling construction upon the simpleceremony.  Low boys shouted after us--or if it was not after us, Ithought it was--and that their cry was "Stop thief!"  Enough said ofone of the most unpleasant cab-drives I ever had in my life.  Horrescoreferens.At the bank, however, thanks to the foresight and liberality ofRaffles, all was smooth water.  I paid my cabman handsomely, gave aflorin to the stout fellow in livery whom he helped with the chest, andcould have pressed gold upon the genial clerk who laughed like agentleman at my jokes about the Liverpool winners and the latestbetting on the Family Plate.  I was only disconcerted when he informedme that the bank gave no receipts for deposits of this nature.  I amnow aware that few London banks do.  But it is pleasing to believe thatat the time I looked--what I felt--as though all I valued upon earthwere in jeopardy.I should have got through the rest of that day happily enough, such wasthe load off my mind and hands, but for an extraordinary and mostdisconcerting note received late at night from Raffles himself. He wasa man who telegraphed freely, but seldom wrote a letter. Sometimes,however, he sent a scribbled line by special messenger; and overnight,evidently in the train, he had scribbled this one to post in the smallhours at Crewe:  "'Ware Prince of Professors!  He was in the offing when I left.  If slightest cause for uneasiness about bank, withdraw at once  and keep in own rooms Like good chap,                                                    "A. J. R.  "P. S.--Other reasons, as you shall hear."There was a nice nightcap for a puzzled head!  I had made rather anevening of it, what with increase of funds and decrease of anxiety, butthis cryptic admonition spoiled the remainder of my night.  It hadarrived by a late post, and I only wished that I had left it all nightin my letter-box.  What exactly did it mean?  And what exactly must Ido?  These were questions that confronted me with fresh force in themorning.The news of Crawshay did not surprise me.  I was quite sure thatRaffles had been given good reason to bear him in mind before hisjourney, even if he had not again beheld the ruffian in the flesh. Thatruffian and that journey might be more intimately connected than I hadyet supposed.  Raffles never told me all.  Yet the solid fact heldgood--held better than ever--that I had seen his plunder safely plantedin my bank.  Crawshay himself could not follow it there.  I was certainhe had not followed my cab: in the acute self-consciousness induced bythat abominable drive, I should have known it in my bones if he had.  Ithought of the porter's friend who had helped me with the chest.  No, Iremember him as well as I remembered Crawshay; they were quitedifferent types.To remove that vile box from the bank, on top of another cab, with nostronger pretext and no further instructions, was not to be thought offor a moment.  Yet I did think of it, for hours.  I was always anxiousto do my part by Raffles; he had done more than his by me, not once ortwice, to-day or yesterday, but again and again from the very first.  Ineed not state the obvious reasons I had for fighting shy of thepersonal custody of his accursed chest. Yet he had run worse risks forme, and I wanted him to learn that he, too, could depend on a devotionnot unworthy of his own.In my dilemma I did what I have often done when at a loss for light andleading.  I took hardly any lunch, but went to Northumberland Avenueand had a Turkish bath instead.  I know nothing so cleansing to mind aswell as body, nothing better calculated to put the finest possible edgeon such judgment as one may happen to possess.  Even Raffles, withoutan ounce to lose or a nerve to soothe, used to own a sensuousappreciation of the peace of mind and person to be gained in thisfashion when all others failed.  For me, the fun began before the bootswere off one's feet; the muffled footfalls, the thin sound of thefountain, even the spent swathed forms upon the couches, and the wholeclean, warm, idle atmosphere, were so much unction to my simpler soul.The half-hour in the hot-rooms I used to count but a strenuous step toa divine lassitude of limb and accompanying exaltation of intellect.And yet--and yet--it was in the hottest room of all, in a temperatureof 270 deg. Fahrenheit, that the bolt fell from the Pall Mall Gazettewhich I had bought outside the bath.I was turning over the hot, crisp pages, and positively revelling in myfiery furnace, when the following headlines and leaded paragraphs leaptto my eye with the force of a veritable blow:                    BANK ROBBERS IN THE WEST END--                    DARING AND MYSTERIOUS CRIME  An audacious burglary and dastardly assault have been committed  on the premises of the City and Suburban Bank in Sloane Street, W.  From the details so far to hand, the robbery appears to have been  deliberately planned and adroitly executed in the early hours of  this morning.  A night watchman named Fawcett states that between one and two  o'clock he heard a slight noise in the neighborhood of the lower  strong-room, used as a repository for the plate and other  possessions of various customers of the bank.  Going down to  investigate, he was instantly attacked by a powerful ruffian,  who succeeded in felling him to the ground before an alarm could  be raised.  Fawcett is unable to furnish any description of his assailant  or assailants, but is of opinion that more than one were engaged  in the commission of the crime.  When the unfortunate man  recovered consciousness, no trace of the thieves remained, with  the exception of a single candle which had been left burning on  the flags of the corridor.  The strong-room, however, had been  opened, and it is feared the raid on the chests of plate and  other valuables may prove to have been only too successful, in  view of the Easter exodus, which the thieves had evidently taken  into account.  The ordinary banking chambers were not even  visited; entry and exit are believed to have been effected  through the coal cellar, which is also situated in the basement.  Up to the present the police have effected no arrest.I sat practically paralyzed by this appalling news; and I swear that,even in that incredible temperature, it was a cold perspiration inwhich I sweltered from head to heel.  Crawshay, of course!  Crawshayonce more upon the track of Raffles and his ill-gotten gains!  And oncemore I blamed Raffles himself: his warning had come too late: he shouldhave wired to me at once not to take the box to the bank at all.  Hewas a madman ever to have invested in so obvious and obtrusive areceptacle for treasure.  It would serve Raffles right if that and noother was the box which had been broken into by the thieves.Yet, when I considered the character of his treasure, I fairlyshuddered in my sweat.  It was a hoard of criminal relics.  Suppose hischest had indeed been rifled, and emptied of every silver thing butone; that one remaining piece of silver, seen of men, was quite enoughto cast Raffles into the outer darkness of penal servitude! AndCrawshay was capable of it--of perceiving the insidious revenge--oftaking it without compunction or remorse.There was only one course for me.  I must follow my instructions to theletter and recover the chest at all hazards, or be taken myself in theattempt.  If only Raffles had left me some address, to which I couldhave wired some word of warning!  But it was no use thinking of that;for the rest there was time enough up to four o'clock, and as yet itwas not three.  I determined to go through with my bath and make themost of it.  Might it not be my last for years?But I was past enjoying even a Turkish bath.  I had not the patiencefor a proper shampoo, or sufficient spirit for the plunge.  I weighedmyself automatically, for that was a matter near my heart; but I forgotto give my man his sixpence until the reproachful intonation of hisadieu recalled me to myself.  And my couch in the cooling gallery--myfavorite couch, in my favorite corner, which I had secured with gustoon coming in--it was a bed of thorns, with hideous visions of aplank-bed to follow!I ought to be able to add that I heard the burglary discussed onadjacent couches before I left I certainly listened for it, and wasrather disappointed more than once when I had held my breath in vain.But this is the unvarnished record of an odious hour, and it passedwithout further aggravation from without; only, as I drove to SloaneStreet, the news was on all the posters, and on one I read of "a clew"which spelt for me a doom I was grimly resolved to share.Already there was something in the nature of a "run" up on the SloaneStreet branch of the City and Suburban.  A cab drove away with a chestof reasonable dimensions as mine drove up, while in the bank itself alady was making a painful scene.  As for the genial clerk who hadroared at my jokes the day before, he was mercifully in no mood for anymore, but, on the contrary, quite rude to me at sight."I've been expecting you all the afternoon," said he.  "You needn'tlook so pale.""Is it safe?""That Noah's Ark of yours?  Yes, so I hear; they'd just got to it whenthey were interrupted, and they never went back again.""Then it wasn't even opened?""Only just begun on, I believe.""Thank God!""You may; we don't," growled the clerk.  "The manager says he believesyour chest was at the bottom of it all.""How could it be?" I asked uneasily."By being seen on the cab a mile off, and followed," said the clerk."Does the manager want to see me?" I asked boldly."Not unless you want to see him," was the blunt reply.  "He's been atit with others all the afternoon, and they haven't all got off as cheapas you.""Then my silver shall not embarrass you any longer," said I grandly. "Imeant to leave it if it was all right, but after all you have said Icertainly shall not.  Let your man or men bring up the chest at once.I dare say they also have been 'at it with others all the afternoon,'but I shall make this worth their while."I did not mind driving through the streets with the thing this time. Mypresent relief was too overwhelming as yet to admit of pangs and fearsfor the immediate future.  No summer sun had ever shone more brightlythan that rather watery one of early April.  There was a green-and-golddust of buds and shoots on the trees as we passed the park.  I feltgreater things sprouting in my heart.  Hansoms passed with schoolboysjust home for the Easter holidays, four-wheelers outward bound, withbicycles and perambulators atop; none that rode in them were half sohappy as I, with the great load on my cab, but the greater one off myheart.At Mount Street it just went into the lift; that was a stroke of luck;and the lift-man and I between us carried it into my flat. It seemed afeatherweight to me now.  I felt a Samson in the exaltation of thathour.  And I will not say what my first act was when I found myselfalone with my white elephant in the middle of the room; enough that thesiphon was still doing its work when the glass slipped through myfingers to the floor."Bunny!"It was Raffles.  Yet for a moment I looked about me quite in vain. Hewas not at the window; he was not at the open door.  And yet Raffles ithad been, or at all events his voice, and that bubbling over with funand satisfaction, be his body where it might.  In the end I dropped myeyes, and there was his living face in the middle of the lid of thechest, like that of the saint upon its charger.But Raffles was alive, Raffles was laughing as though his vocal cordswould snap--there was neither tragedy nor illusion in the apparition ofRaffles.  A life-size Jack-in-the-box, he had thrust his head through alid within the lid, cut by himself between the two iron bands that ranround the chest like the straps of a portmanteau.  He must have beenbusy at it when I found him pretending to pack, if not far into thatnight, for it was a very perfect piece of work; and even as I staredwithout a word, and he crouched laughing in my face, an arm camesqueezing out, keys in hand; one was turned in either of the two greatpadlocks, the whole lid lifted, and out stepped Raffles like theconjurer he was."So you were the burglar!" I exclaimed at last.  "Well, I am just asglad I didn't know."He had wrung my hand already, but at this he fairly mangled it in his."You dear little brick," he cried, "that's the one thing of all thingsI longed to hear you say!  How could you have behaved as you've done ifyou had known?  How could any living man?  How could you have acted, asthe polar star of all the stages could not have acted in your place?Remember that I have heard a lot, and as good as seen as much as I'veheard.  Bunny, I don't know where you were greatest: at the Albany,here, or at your bank!""I don't know where I was most miserable," I rejoined, beginning to seethe matter in a less perfervid light.  "I know you don't credit me withmuch finesse, but I would undertake to be in the secret and to do quiteas well; the only difference would be in my own peace of mind, which,of course, doesn't count."But Raffles wagged away with his most charming and disarming smile; hewas in old clothes, rather tattered and torn, and more than a littlegrimy as to the face and hands, but, on the surface, wonderfully littlethe worse for his experience.  And, as I say, his smile was the smileof the Raffles I loved best."You would have done your damnedest, Bunny!  There is no limit to yourheroism; but you forget the human equation in the pluckiest of theplucky.  I couldn't afford to forget it, Bunny; I couldn't afford togive a point away.  Don't talk as though I hadn't trusted you!  Itrusted my very life to your loyal tenacity.  What do you suppose wouldhave happened to me if you had let me rip in that strong-room?  Do youthink I would ever have crept out and given myself up?  Yes, I'll havea peg for once; the beauty of all laws is in the breaking, even of thekind we make unto ourselves."I had a Sullivan for him, too; and in another minute he was spread outon my sofa, stretching his cramped limbs with infinite gusto, acigarette between his fingers, a yellow bumper at hand on the chest ofhis triumph and my tribulation."Never mind when it occurred to me, Bunny; as a matter of fact, it wasonly the other day, when I had decided to go away for the real reasonsI have already given you.  I may have made more of them to you than Ido in my own mind, but at all events they exist.  And I really did wantthe telephone and the electric light.""But where did you stow the silver before you went?""Nowhere; it was my luggage--a portmanteau, cricket-bag, and suit-casefull of very little else--and by the same token I left the lot atEuston, and one of us must fetch them this evening.""I can do that," said I.  "But did you really go all the way to Crewe?""Didn't you get my note?  I went all the way to Crewe to post you thosefew lines, my dear Bunny!  It's no use taking trouble if you don't taketrouble enough; I wanted you to show the proper set of faces at thebank and elsewhere, and I know you did.  Besides, there was an up-trainfour minutes after mine got in.  I simply posted my letter in Crewestation, and changed from one train to the other.""At two in the morning!""Nearer three, Bunny.  It was after seven when I slung in with theDaily Mail.  The milk had beaten me by a short can.  But even so I hadtwo very good hours before you were due.""And to think," I murmured, "how you deceived me there!""With your own assistance," said Raffles laughing.  "If you had lookedit up you would have seen there was no such train in the morning, and Inever said there was.  But I meant you to be deceived, Bunny, and Iwon't say I didn't--it was all for the sake of the side!  Well, whenyou carted me away with such laudable despatch, I had rather anuncomfortable half-hour, but that was all just then.  I had my candle,I had matches, and lots to read. It was quite nice in that strong-roomuntil a very unpleasant incident occurred.""Do tell me, my dear fellow!""I must have another Sullivan--thank you--and a match.  The unpleasantincident was steps outside and a key in the lock!  I was disportingmyself on the lid of the trunk at the time.  I had barely time to knockout my light and slip down behind it.  Luckily it was only another boxof sorts; a jewel-case, to be more precise; you shall see the contentsin a moment.  The Easter exodus has done me even better than I dared tohope."His words reminded me of the Pall Mall Gazette, which I had brought inmy pocket from the Turkish bath.  I fished it out, all wrinkled andbloated by the heat of the hottest room, and handed it to Raffles withmy thumb upon the leaded paragraphs."Delightful!" said he when he had read them.  "More thieves than one,and the coal-cellar of all places as a way in!  I certainly tried togive it that appearance.  I left enough candle-grease there to makethose coals burn bravely.  But it looked up into a blind backyard,Bunny, and a boy of eight couldn't have squeezed through the trap. Longmay that theory keep them happy at Scotland Yard!""But what about the fellow you knocked out?" I asked.  "That was notlike you, Raffles."Raffles blew pensive rings as he lay back on my sofa, his black hairtumbled on the cushion, his pale profile as clear and sharp against thelight as though slashed out with the scissors."I know it wasn't, Bunny," he said regretfully.  "But things like that,as the poet will tell you, are really inseparable from victories likemine.  It had taken me a couple of hours to break out of thatstrong-room; I was devoting a third to the harmless task of simulatingthe appearance of having broken in; and it was then I heard thefellow's stealthy step.  Some might have stood their ground and killedhim; more would have bolted into a worse corner than they were inalready.  I left my candle where it was, crept to meet the poor devil,flattened myself against the wall, and let him have it as he passed.  Iacknowledge the foul blow, but here's evidence that it was mercifullystruck.  The victim has already told his tale."As he drained his glass, but shook his head when I wished to replenishit, Raffles showed me the flask which he had carried in his pocket: itwas still nearly full; and I found that he had otherwise provisionedhimself over the holidays.  On either Easter Day or Bank Holiday, had Ifailed him, it had been his intention to make the best escape he could.But the risk must have been enormous, and it filled my glowing skin tothink that he had not relied on me in vain.As for his gleanings from such jewel-cases as were spending the Easterrecess in the strong-room of my bank, (without going into rhapsodies oreven particulars on the point,) I may mention that they realized enoughfor me to join Raffles on his deferred holiday in Scotland, besidesenabling him to play more regularly for Middlesex in the ensuing summerthan had been the case for several seasons.  In fine, this particularexploit entirely justified itself in my eyes, in spite of thesuperfluous (but invariable) secretiveness which I could seldom helpresenting in my heart I never thought less of it than in the presentinstance; and my one mild reproach was on the subject of the phantomCrawshay."You let me think he was in the air again," I said.  "But it wouldn'tsurprise me to find that you had never heard of him since the day ofhis escape through your window.""I never even thought of him, Bunny, until you came to see me the daybefore yesterday, and put him into my head with your first words. Thewhole point was to make you as genuinely anxious about the plate as youmust have seemed all along the line.""Of course I see your point," I rejoined; "but mine is that you laboredit.  You needn't have written me a downright lie about the fellow.""Nor did I, Bunny.""Not about the 'prince of professors' being 'in the offing' when youleft?""My dear Bunny, but so he was!" cried Raffles.  "Time was when I wasnone too pure an amateur.  But after this I take leave to considermyself a professor of the professors.  And I should like to see onemore capable of skippering their side!"The Rest CureI had not seen Raffles for a month or more, and I was sadly in need ofhis advice.  My life was being made a burden to me by a wretch who hadobtained a bill of sale over the furniture in Mount Street, and it wasonly by living elsewhere that I could keep the vulpine villain from mydoor.  This cost ready money, and my balance at the bank was sorely inneed of another lift from Raffles.  Yet, had he been in my shoes, hecould not have vanished more effectually than he had done, both fromthe face of the town and from the ken of all who knew him.It was late in August; he never played first-class cricket after July,when, a scholastic understudy took his place in the Middlesex eleven.And in vain did I scour my Field and my Sportsman for the country-housematches with which he wilfully preferred to wind up the season; thematches were there, but never the magic name of A. J. Raffles.  Nothingwas known of him at the Albany; he had left no instructions about hisletters, either there or at the club.  I began to fear that some evilhad overtaken him.  I scanned the features of captured criminals in theillustrated Sunday papers; on each occasion I breathed again; nor wasanything worthy of Raffles going on.  I will not deny that I was lessanxious on his account than on my own.  But it was a double relief tome when he gave a first characteristic sign of life.I had called at the Albany for the fiftieth time, and returned toPiccadilly in my usual despair, when a street sloucher sidled up to mein furtive fashion and inquired if my name was what it is."'Cause this 'ere's for you," he rejoined to my affirmative, and withthat I felt a crumpled note in my palm.It was from Raffles.  I smoothed out the twisted scrap of paper, and onit were just a couple of lines in pencil:"Meet me in Holland Walk at dark to-night.  Walk up and down till Icome.                                           A.  J.  R."That was all!  Not another syllable after all these weeks, and the fewwords scribbled in a wild caricature of his scholarly and dainty hand!I was no longer to be alarmed by this sort of thing; it was all so likethe Raffles I loved least; and to add to my indignation, when at lengthI looked up from the mysterious missive, the equally mysteriousmessenger had disappeared in a manner worthy of the whole affair.  Hewas, however, the first creature I espied under the tattered trees ofHolland Walk that evening."Seen 'im yet?" he inquired confidentially, blowing a vile cloud fromhis horrid pipe."No, I haven't; and I want to know where you've seen him," I repliedsternly.  "Why did you run away like that the moment you had given mehis note?""Orders, orders," was the reply.  "I ain't such a juggins as to go agena toff as makes it worf while to do as I'm bid an' 'old me tongue.""And who may you be?" I asked jealously.  "And what are you to Mr.Raffles?""You silly ass, Bunny, don't tell all Kensington that I'm in town!"replied my tatterdemalion, shooting up and smoothing out into a merelyshabby Raffles.  "Here, take my arm--I'm not so beastly as I look.  Butneither am I in town, nor in England, nor yet on the face of the earth,for all that's known of me to a single soul but you.""Then where are you," I asked, "between ourselves?""I've taken a house near here for the holidays, where I'm going in fora Rest Cure of my own description.  Why?  Oh, for lots of reasons, mydear Bunny; among others, I have long had a wish to grow my own beard;under the next lamppost you will agree that it's training on verynicely.  Then, you mayn't know it, but there's a canny man at ScotlandYard who has had a quiet eye on me longer than I like.  I thought itabout time to have an eye on him, and I stared him in the face outsidethe Albany this very morning.  That was when I saw you go in, andscribbled a line to give you when you came out.  If he had caught ustalking he would have spotted me at once.""So you are lying low out here!""I prefer to call it my Rest Cure," returned Raffles, "and it's reallynothing else.  I've got a furnished house at a time when no one elsewould have dreamed of taking one in town; and my very neighbors don'tknow I'm there, though I'm bound to say there are hardly any of them athome.  I don't keep a servant, and do everything for myself.  It's thenext best fun to a desert island. Not that I make much work, for I'mreally resting, but I haven't done so much solid reading for years.Rather a joke, Bunny: the man whose house I've taken is one of herMajesty's inspectors of prisons, and his study's a storehouse ofcriminology.  It has been quite amusing to lie on one's back and have agood look at one's self as others fondly imagine they see one.""But surely you get some exercise?" I asked; for he was leading me at agood rate through the leafy byways of Camp den Hill; and his step wasas springy and as light as ever."The best exercise I ever had in my life," said Raffles; "and you wouldnever live to guess what it is.  It's one of the reasons why I went infor this seedy kit.  I follow cabs.  Yes, Bunny, I turn out about duskand meet the expresses at Euston or King's Cross; that is, of course, Iloaf outside and pick my cab, and often run my three or four miles fora bob or less.  And it not only keeps you in the very pink: if you'regood they let you carry the trunks up-stairs; and I've taken notes fromthe inside of more than one commodious residence which will come inuseful in the autumn.  In fact, Bunny, what with these new Rowtonhouses, my beard, and my otherwise well-spent holiday, I hope to havequite a good autumn season before the erratic Raffles turns up in town."I felt it high time to wedge in a word about my own far lesssatisfactory affairs.  But it was not necessary for me to recount halfmy troubles.  Raffles could be as full of himself as many a worse man,and I did not like his society the less for these human outpourings.They had rather the effect of putting me on better terms with myself,through bringing him down to my level for the time being.  But hisegoism was not even skin-deep; it was rather a cloak, which Rafflescould cast off quicker than any man I ever knew, as he did not fail toshow me now."Why, Bunny, this is the very thing!" he cried.  "You must come andstay with me, and we'll lie low side by side.  Only remember it reallyis a Rest Cure.  I want to keep literally as quiet as I was withoutyou.  What do you say to forming ourselves at once into a practicallySilent Order?  You agree?  Very well, then, here's the street andthat's the house."It was ever such a quiet little street, turning out of one of thosewhich climb right over the pleasant hill.  One side was monopolized bythe garden wall of an ugly but enviable mansion standing in its ownground; opposite were a solid file of smaller but taller houses; onneither side were there many windows alight, nor a solitary soul on thepavement or in the road.  Raffles led the way to one of the small tallhouses.  It stood immediately behind a lamppost, and I could not butnotice that a love-lock of Virginia creeper was trailing almost to thestep, and that the bow-window on the ground floor was closelyshuttered.  Raffles admitted himself with his latch-key, and I squeezedpast him into a very narrow hall.  I did not hear him shut the door,but we were no longer in the lamplight, and he pushed softly past me inhis turn."I'll get a light," he muttered as he went; but to let him pass I hadleaned against some electric switches, and while 'his back was turned Itried one of these without thinking.  In an instant hall and staircasewere flooded with light; in another Raffles was upon me in a fury, and,all was dark once more.  He had not said a word, but I heard himbreathing through his teeth.Nor was there anything to tell me now.  The mere flash of electriclight upon a hail of chaos and uncarpeted stairs, and on the face ofRaffles as he sprang to switch it off, had been enough even for me."So this is how you have taken the house," said I in his own undertone."'Taken' is good; 'taken' is beautiful!""Did you think I'd done it through an agent?" he snarled.  "Upon myword, Bunny, I did you the credit of supposing you saw the joke all thetime!""Why shouldn't you take a house," I asked, "and pay for it?""Why should I," he retorted, "within three miles of the Albany?Besides, I should have had no peace; and I meant every word I saidabout my Rest Cure.""You are actually staying in a house where you've broken in to steal?""Not to steal, Bunny!  I haven't stolen a thing.  But staying here Icertainly am, and having the most complete rest a busy man could wish.""There'll be no rest for me!"Raffles laughed as he struck a match.  I had followed him into whatwould have been the back drawing-room in the ordinary little Londonhouse; the inspector of prisons had converted it into a separate studyby filling the folding doors with book-shelves, which I scanned at oncefor the congenial works of which Raffles had spoken.  I was not able tocarry my examination very far.  Raffles had lighted a candle, stuck (byits own grease) in the crown of an opera hat, which he opened themoment the wick caught.  The light thus struck the ceiling in an ovalshaft, which left the rest of the room almost as dark as it had beenbefore."Sorry, Bunny!" said Raffles, sitting on one pedestal of a desk fromwhich the top had been removed, and setting his makeshift lantern onthe other.  "In broad daylight, when it can't be spotted from theoutside, you shall have as much artificial light as you like.  If youwant to do some writing, that's the top of the desk on end against themantlepiece.  You'll never have a better chance so far as interruptiongoes.  But no midnight oil or electricity!  You observe that their lastcare was to fix up these shutters; they appear to have taken the topoff the desk to get at 'em without standing on it; but the beastlythings wouldn't go all the way up, and the strip they leave would giveus away to the backs of the other houses if we lit up after dark.  Mindthat telephone!  If you touch the receiver they will know at theexchange that the house is not empty, and I wouldn't put it past thecolonel to have told them exactly how long he was going to be away.He's pretty particular: look at the strips of paper to keep the dustoff his precious books!""Is he a colonel?" I asked, perceiving that Raffles referred to theabsentee householder."Of sappers," he replied, "and a V.C. into the bargain, confound him!Got it at Rorke's Drift; prison governor or inspector ever since;favorite recreation, what do you think?  Revolver shooting!  You canread all about him in his own Who's Who.  A devil of a chap to tackle,Bunny, when he's at home!""And where is he now?" I asked uneasily.  "And do you know he isn't onhis way home?""Switzerland," replied Raffles, chuckling; "he wrote one too manylabels, and was considerate enough to leave it behind for our guidance.Well, no one ever comes back from Switzerland at the beginning ofSeptember, you know; and nobody ever thinks of coming back before theservants. When they turn up they won't get in.  I keep the latchjammed, but the servants will think it's jammed itself, and whilethey're gone for the locksmith we shall walk out like gentlemen--if wehaven't done so already.""As you walked in, I suppose?"Raffles shook his head in the dim light to which my sight was growinginured."No, Bunny, I regret to say I came in through the dormer window. Theywere painting next door but one.  I never did like ladder work, but ittakes less time than in picking a lock in the broad light of a streetlamp.""So they left you a latch-key as well as everything else!""No, Bunny.  I was just able to make that for myself.  I am playing at'Robinson Crusoe,' not 'The Swiss Family Robinson.'  And now, my dearFriday, if you will kindly take off those boots, we can explore theisland before we turn in for the night."The stairs were very steep and narrow, and they creaked alarmingly asRaffles led the way up, with the single candle in the crown of thecolonel's hat.  He blew it out before we reached the half-landing,where a naked window stared upon the backs of the houses in the nextroad, but lit it again at the drawing-room door.  I just peeped in upona semi-grand swathed in white and a row of water colors mounted ingold.  An excellent bathroom broke our journey to the second floor."I'll have one to-night," said I, taking heart of a luxury unknown inmy last sordid sanctuary."You'll do no such thing," snapped Raffles.  "Have the goodness toremember that our island is one of a group inhabited by hostile tribes.You can fill the bath quietly if you try, but it empties under thestudy window, and makes the very devil of a noise about it.  No, Bunny,I bale out every drop and pour it away through the scullery sink, soyou will kindly consult me before you turn a tap. Here's your room;hold the light outside while I draw the curtains; it's the old chap'sdressing-room.  Now you can bring the glim. How's that for a jollywardrobe?  And look at his coats on their cross-trees inside: dapperold dog, shouldn't you say?  Mark the boots on the shelf above, and thelittle brass rail for his ties! Didn't I tell you he was particular?And wouldn't he simply love to catch us at his kit?""Let's only hope it would give him an apoplexy," said I shuddering."I shouldn't build on it," replied Raffles.  "That's a big man'strouble, and neither you nor I could get into the old chap's clothes.But come into the best bedroom, Bunny.  You won't think me selfish if Idon't give it up to you?  Look at this, my boy, look at this! It's theonly one I use in all the house."I had followed him into a good room, with ample windows closelycurtained, and he had switched on the light in a hanging lamp at thebedside.  The rays fell from a thick green funnel in a plateful ofstrong light upon a table deep in books.  I noticed several volumes ofthe "Invasion of the Crimea.""That's where I rest the body and exercise the brain," said Raffles. "Ihave long wanted to read my Kinglake from A to Z, and I manage about avolume a night.  There's a style for you, Bunny!  I love thepunctilious thoroughness of the whole thing; one can understand itsappeal to our careful colonel.  His name, did you say?  Crutchley,Bunny--Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C.""We'd put his valor to the test!" said I, feeling more valiant myselfafter our tour of inspection."Not so loud on the stairs," whispered Raffles.  "There's only one doorbetween us and--"Raffles stood still at my feet, and well he might!  A deafening doubleknock had resounded through the empty house; and to add to the utterhorror of the moment, Raffles instantly blew out the light. I heard myheart pounding.  Neither of us breathed.  We were on our way down tothe first landing, and for a moment we stood like mice; then Rafflesheaved a deep sigh, and in the depths I heard the gate swing home."Only the postman, Bunny!  He will come now and again, though they haveobviously left instructions at the post-office.  I hope the old colonelwill let them have it when he gets back.  I confess it gave me a turn.""Turn!" I gasped.  "I must have a drink, if I die for it.""My dear Bunny, that's no part of my Rest Cure.""Then good-by!  I can't stand it; feel my forehead; listen to my heart!Crusoe found a footprint, but he never heard a double-knock at thestreet door!""'Better live in the midst of alarms,'" quoted Raffles, "'than dwell inthis horrible place.'  I must confess we get it both ways, Bunny. YetI've nothing but tea in the house.""And where do you make that?  Aren't you afraid of smoke?""There's a gas-stove in the dining-room.""But surely to goodness," I cried, "there's a cellar lower down!""My dear, good Bunny," said Raffles, "I've told you already that Ididn't come in here on business.  I came in for the Cure.  Not a pennywill these people be the worse, except for their washing and theirelectric light, and I mean to leave enough to cover both items.""Then," said I, "since Brutus is such a very honorable man, we willborrow a bottle from the cellar, and replace it before we go."Raffles slapped me softly on the back, and I knew that I had gained mypoint.  It was often the case when I had the presence of heart and mindto stand up to him.  But never was little victory of mine quite sograteful as this.  Certainly it was a very small cellar, indeed a merecupboard under the kitchen stairs, with a most ridiculous lock.  Norwas this cupboard overstocked with wine.  But I made out a jar ofwhiskey, a shelf of Zeltinger, another of claret, and a short one atthe top which presented a little battery of golden-leafed necks andcorks.  Raffles set his hand no lower.  He examined the labels while Iheld folded hat and naked light."Mumm, '84!" he whispered.  "G. H. Mumm, and A.D. 1884!  I am nowine-bibber, Bunny, as you know, but I hope you appreciate thespecifications as I do.  It looks to me like the only bottle, the lastof its case, and it does seem a bit of a shame; but more shame for themiser who hoards in his cellar what was meant for mankind! Come, Bunny,lead the way.  This baby is worth nursing.  It would break my heart ifanything happened to it now!"So we celebrated my first night in the furnished house; and I sleptbeyond belief, slept as I never was to sleep there again.  But it wasstrange to hear the milkman in the early morning, and the postmanknocking his way along the street an hour later, and to be passed overby one destroying angel after another.  I had come down early enough,and watched through the drawing-room blind the cleansing of all thesteps in the street but ours.  Yet Raffles had evidently been up sometime; the house seemed far purer than overnight as though he hadmanaged to air it room by room; and from the one with the gas-stovethere came a frizzling sound that fattened the heart.I only would I had the pen to do justice to the week I spent in-doorson Campden Hill!  It might make amusing reading; the reality for me wasfar removed from the realm of amusement.  Not that I was denied many alaugh of suppressed heartiness when Raffles and I were together.  Buthalf our time we very literally saw nothing of each other.  I need notsay whose fault that was.  He would be quiet; he was in ridiculous andoffensive earnest about his egregious Cure. Kinglake he would read bythe hour together, day and night, by the hanging lamp, lying up-stairson the best bed.  There was daylight enough for me in the drawing-roombelow; and there I would sit immersed in criminous tomes weaklyfascinated until I shivered and shook in my stocking soles.  Often Ilonged to do something hysterically desperate, to rouse Raffles andbring the street about our ears; once I did bring him about mine bystriking a single note on the piano, with the soft pedal down.  Hisneglect of me seemed wanton at the time.  I have long realized that hewas only wise to maintain silence at the expense of perilous amenities,and as fully justified in those secret and solitary sorties which madebad blood in my veins.  He was far cleverer than I at getting in andout; but even had I been his match for stealth and wariness, my companywould have doubled every risk.  I admit now that he treated me withquite as much sympathy as common caution would permit.  But at the timeI took it so badly as to plan a small revenge.What with his flourishing beard and the increasing shabbiness of theonly suit he had brought with him to the house, there was no denyingthat Raffles had now the advantage of a permanent disguise. That wasanother of his excuses for leaving me as he did, and it was the one Iwas determined to remove.  On a morning, therefore, when I awoke tofind him flown again, I proceeded to execute a plan which I had alreadymatured in my mind.  Colonel Crutchley was a married man; there were nosigns of children in the house; on the other hand, there was muchevidence that the wife was a woman of fashion.  Her dresses overflowedthe wardrobe and her room; large, flat, cardboard boxes were to befound in every corner of the upper floors.  She was a tall woman; I wasnot too tall a man.  Like Raffles, I had not shaved on Campden Hill.That morning, however, I did my best with a very fair razor which thecolonel had left behind in my room; then I turned out the lady'swardrobe and the cardboard boxes, and took my choice.I have fair hair, and at the time it was rather long.  With a pair ofMrs. Crutchley's tongs and a discarded hair-net, I was able to producean almost immodest fringe.  A big black hat with a wintry feathercompleted a headdress as unseasonable as my skating skirt and featherboa; of course, the good lady had all her summer frocks away with herin Switzerland.  This was all the more annoying from the fact that wewere having a very warm September; so I was not sorry to hear Rafflesreturn as I was busy adding a layer of powder to my heated countenance.I listened a moment on the landing, but as he went into the study Idetermined to complete my toilet in every detail.  My idea was first togive him the fright he deserved, and secondly to show him that I wasquite as fit to move abroad as he.  It was, however, I confess, a pairof the colonel's gloves that I was buttoning as I slipped down to thestudy even more quietly than usual.  The electric light was on, as itgenerally was by day, and under it stood as formidable a figure as everI encountered in my life of crime.Imagine a thin but extremely wiry man, past middle age, brown andbloodless as any crabapple, but as coolly truculent and as casuallyalert as Raffles at his worst.  It was, it could only be, thefire-eating and prison-inspecting colonel himself!  He was ready forme, a revolver in his hand, taken, as I could see, from one of thoselocked drawers in the pedestal desk with which Raffles had refused totamper; the drawer was open, and a bunch of keys depended from thelock.  A grim smile crumpled up the parchment face, so that one eye waspuckered out of sight; the other was propped open by an eyeglass,which, however, dangled on its string when I appeared."A woman, begad!" the warrior exclaimed.  "And where's the man, youscarlet hussy?"Not a word could I utter.  But, in my horror and my amazement, I haveno sort of doubt that I acted the part I had assumed in a manner Inever should have approached in happier circumstances."Come, come, my lass," cried the old oak veteran, "I'm not going to puta bullet through you, you know!  You tell me all about it, and it'll doyou more good than harm.  There, I'll put the nasty thing away and--Godbless me, if the brazen wench hasn't squeezed into the wife's kit!"A squeeze it happened to have been, and in my emotion it felt more ofone than ever; but his sudden discovery had not heightened theveteran's animosity against me.  On the contrary, I caught a glint ofhumor through his gleaming glass, and he proceeded to pocket hisrevolver like the gentleman he was."Well, well, it's lucky I looked in," he continued.  "I only came roundon the off-chance of letters, but if I hadn't you'd have had anotherweek in clover.  Begad, though, I saw your handwriting the moment I'dgot my nose inside!  Now just be sensible and tell me where your goodman is."I had no man.  I was alone, had broken in alone.  There was not a soulin the affair (much less the house) except myself.  So much I stutteredout in tones too hoarse to betray me on the spot.  But the old man ofthe world shook a hard old head."Quite right not to give away your pal," said he.  "But I'm not one ofthe marines, my dear, and you mustn't expect me to swallow all that.Well, if you won't say, you won't, and we must just send for those whowill."In a flash I saw his fell design.  The telephone directory lay open onone of the pedestals.  He must have been consulting it when he heard meon the stairs; he had another look at it now; and that gave me myopportunity.  With a presence of mind rare enough in me to excuse theboast, I flung myself upon the instrument in the corner and hurled itto the ground with all my might.  I was myself sent spinning into theopposite corner at the same instant.  But the instrument happened to bea standard of the more elaborate pattern, and I flattered myself that Ihad put the delicate engine out of action for the day.Not that my adversary took the trouble to ascertain.  He was looking atme strangely in the electric light, standing intently on his guard, hisright hand in the pocket where he had dropped his revolver.  And I--Ihardly knew it--but I caught up the first thing handy for self-defence,and was brandishing the bottle which Raffles and I had emptied in honorof my arrival on this fatal scene."Be shot if I don't believe you're the man himself!" cried the colonel,shaking an armed fist in my face.  "You young wolf in sheep's clothing.Been at my wine, of course!  Put down that bottle; down with it thisinstant, or I'll drill a tunnel through your middle.  I thought so!Begad, sir, you shall pay for this! Don't you give me an excuse forpotting you now, or I'll jump at the chance!  My last bottle of'84--you miserable blackguard--you unutterable beast!"He had browbeaten me into his own chair in his own corner; he wasstanding over me, empty bottle in one hand, revolver in the other, andmurder itself in the purple puckers of his raging face.  His language Iwill not even pretend to indicate: his skinny throat swelled andtrembled with the monstrous volleys.  He could smile at my appearancein his wife's clothes; he would have had my blood for the last bottleof his best champagne.  His eyes were not hidden now; they needed noeyeglass to prop them open; large with fury, they started from thelivid mask.  I watched nothing else.  I could not understand why theyshould start out as they did.  I did not try. I say I watched nothingelse--until I saw the face of Raffles over the unfortunate officer'sshoulder.Raffles had crept in unheard while our altercation was at its height,had watched his opportunity, and stolen on his man unobserved by eitherof us.  While my own attention was completely engrossed, he had seizedthe colonel's pistol-hand and twisted it behind the colonel's backuntil his eyes bulged out as I have endeavored to describe.  But thefighting man had some fight in him still; and scarcely had I graspedthe situation when he hit out venomously behind with the bottle, whichwas smashed to bits on Raffles's shin. Then I threw my strength intothe scale; and before many minutes we had our officer gagged and boundin his chair.  But it was not one of our bloodless victories.  Raffleshad been cut to the bone by the broken glass; his leg bled wherever helimped; and the fierce eyes of the bound man followed the wet trailwith gleams of sinister satisfaction.I thought I had never seen a man better bound or better gagged.  Butthe humanity seemed to have run out of Raffles with his blood.  He toreup tablecloths, he cut down blind-cords, he brought the dust-sheetsfrom the drawing-room, and multiplied every bond.  The unfortunateman's legs were lashed to the legs of his chair, his arms to its arms,his thighs and back fairly welded to the leather. Either end of his ownruler protruded from his bulging cheeks--the middle was hidden by hismoustache--and the gag kept in place by remorseless lashings at theback of his head.  It was a spectacle I could not bear to contemplateat length, while from the first I found myself physically unable toface the ferocious gaze of those implacable eyes.  But Raffles onlylaughed at my squeamishness, and flung a dust-sheet over man and chair;and the stark outline drove me from the room.It was Raffles at his worst, Raffles as I never knew him before orafter--a Raffles mad with pain and rage, and desperate as any othercriminal in the land.  Yet he had struck no brutal blow, he had utteredno disgraceful taunt, and probably not inflicted a tithe of the pain hehad himself to bear.  It is true that he was flagrantly in the wrong,his victim as laudably in the right.  Nevertheless, granting theoriginal sin of the situation, and given this unforeseen development,even I failed to see how Raffles could have combined greater humanitywith any regard for our joint safety; and had his barbarities endedhere, I for one should not have considered them an extraordinaryaggravation of an otherwise minor offence.  But in the broad daylightof the bathroom, which had a ground-glass window but no blind, I saw atonce the serious nature of his wound and of its effect upon the man."It will maim me for a month," said he; "and if the V.C. comes outalive, the wound he gave may be identified with the wound I've got."The V.C.!  There, indeed, was an aggravation to one illogical mind. Butto cast a moment's doubt upon the certainty of his coming out alive!"Of course he'll come out," said I.  "We must make up our minds tothat.""Did he tell you he was expecting the servants or his wife?  If so, ofcourse we must hurry up.""No, Raffles, I'm afraid he's not expecting anybody.  He told me, if hehadn't looked in for letters, we should have had the place to ourselvesanother week.  That's the worst of it."Raffles smiled as he secured a regular puttee of dust-sheeting. Noblood was coming through."I don't agree, Bunny," said he.  "It's quite the best of it, if youask me.""What, that he should die the death?""Why not?"And Raffles stared me out with a hard and merciless light in his clearblue eyes--a light that chilled the blood."If it's a choice between his life and our liberty, you're entitled toyour decision and I'm entitled to mine, and I took it before I boundhim as I did," said Raffles.  "I'm only sorry I took so much trouble ifyou're going to stay behind and put him in the way of releasing himselfbefore he gives up the ghost.  Perhaps you will go and think it overwhile I wash my bags and dry 'em at the gas stove.  It will take me atleast an hour, which will just give me time to finish the last volumeof Kinglake."Long before he was ready to go, however, I was waiting in the hall,clothed indeed, but not in a mind which I care to recall.  Once ortwice I peered into the dining-room where Raffles sat before the stove,without letting him hear me.  He, too, was ready for the street at amoment's notice; but a steam ascended from his left leg, as he satimmersed in his red volume.  Into the study I never went again; butRaffles did, to restore to its proper shelf this and every other bookhe had taken out and so destroy that clew to the manner of man who hadmade himself at home in the house.  On his last visit I heard him whiskoff the dust-sheet; then he waited a minute; and when he came out itwas to lead the way into the open air as though the accursed housebelonged to him."We shall be seen," I whispered at his heels.  "Raffles, Raffles,there's a policeman at the corner!""I know him intimately," replied Raffles, turning, however, the otherway.  "He accosted me on Monday, when I explained that I was an oldsoldier of the colonel's regiment, who came in every few days to airthe place and send on any odd letters.  You see, I have always carriedone or two about me, redirected to that address in Switzerland, andwhen I showed them to him it was all right.  But after that it was nouse listening at the letter-box for a clear coast, was it?"I did not answer; there was too much to exasperate in these prodigiesof cunning which he could never trouble to tell me at the time.  And Iknew why he had kept his latest feats to himself: unwilling to trust meoutside the house, he had systematically exaggerated the dangers of hisown walks abroad; and when to these injuries he added the insult of apatronizing compliment on my late disguise, I again made no reply."What's the good of your coming with me he asked, when I had followedhim across the main stream of Notting Hill."We may as well sink or swim together," I answered sullenly."Yes?  Well, I'm going to swim into the provinces, have a shave on theway, buy a new kit piecemeal, including a cricket-bag (which I reallywant), and come limping back to the Albany with the same old strain inmy bowling leg.  I needn't add that I have been playing country-housecricket for the last month under an alias; it's the only decent way todo it when one's county has need of one.  That's my itinerary, Bunny,but I really can't see why you should come with me.""We may as well swing together!" I growled."As you will, my dear fellow," replied Raffles.  "But I begin to dreadyour company on the drop!"I shall hold my pen on that provincial tour.  Not that I joined Rafflesin any of the little enterprises with which he beguiled the breaks inour journey; our last deed in London was far too great a weight upon mysoul.  I could see that gallant officer in his chair, see him at everyhour of the day and night, now with his indomitable eyes meeting mineferociously, now a stark outline underneath a sheet.  The visiondarkened my day and gave me sleepless nights.  I was with our victim inall his agony; my mind would only leave him for that gallows of whichRaffles had said true things in jest.  No, I could not face so vile adeath lightly, but I could meet it, somehow, better than I could endurea guilty suspense.  In the watches of the second night I made up mymind to meet it halfway, that very morning, while still there might betime to save the life that we had left in jeopardy.  And I got up earlyto tell Raffles of my resolve.His room in the hotel where we were staying was littered with clothesand luggage new enough for any bridegroom; I lifted the lockedcricket-bag, and found it heavier than a cricket-bag has any right tobe.  But in the bed Raffles was sleeping like an infant, his shavenself once more.  And when I shook him he awoke with a smile."Going to confess, eh, Bunny?  Well, wait a bit; the local police won'tthank you for knocking them up at this hour.  And I bought a lateedition which you ought to see; that must be it on the floor. You havea look in the stop-press column, Bunny."I found the place with a sunken heart, and this is what I read:                 WEST-END OUTRAGE  Colonel Crutchley, R.E., V.C., has been the victim of a dastardly  outrage at his residence, Peter Street, Campden Hill.  Returning  unexpectedly to the house, which had been left untenanted during  the absence of the family abroad, it was found occupied by two  ruffians, who overcame and secured the distinguished officer by  the exercise of considerable violence.  When discovered through  the intelligence of the Kensington police, the gallant victim was  gagged and bound hand and foot, and in an advanced stage of  exhaustion."Thanks to the Kensington police," observed Raffles, as I read the lastwords aloud in my horror.  "They can't have gone when they got myletter.""Your letter?""I printed them a line while we were waiting for our train at Euston.They must have got it that night, but they can't have paid anyattention to it until yesterday morning.  And when they do, they takeall the credit and give me no more than you did, Bunny!"I looked at the curly head upon the pillow, at the smiling, handsomeface under the curls.  And at last I understood."So all the time you never meant it!""Slow murder?  You should have known me better.  A few hours' enforcedRest Cure was the worst I wished him.""'You might have told me, Raffles!""That may be, Bunny, but you ought certainly to have trusted me!"The Criminologists' Club"But who are they, Raffles, and where's their house?  There's no suchclub on the list in Whitaker.""The Criminologists, my dear Bunny, are too few for a local habitation,and too select to tell their name in Gath.  They are merely so manysolemn students of contemporary crime, who meet and dine periodicallyat each other's clubs or houses.""But why in the world should they ask us to dine with them?"And I brandished the invitation which had brought me hotfoot to theAlbany: it was from the Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.; and itrequested the honor of my company at dinner, at Thornaby House, ParkLane, to meet the members of the Criminologists' Club.  That in itselfwas a disturbing compliment: judge then of my dismay on learning thatRaffles had been invited too!"They have got it into their heads," said he, "that the gladiatorialelement is the curse of most modern sport.  They tremble especially forthe professional gladiator.  And they want to know whether myexperience tallies with their theory.""So they say!""They quote the case of a league player, sus per coll., and any numberof suicides.  It really is rather in my public line.""In yours, if you like, but not in mine," said I.  "No, Raffles,they've got their eye on us both, and mean to put us under themicroscope, or they never would have pitched on me."Raffles smiled on my perturbation."I almost wish you were right, Bunny!  It would be even better fun thanI mean to make it as it is.  But it may console you to hear that it wasI who gave them your name.  I told them you were a far keenercriminologist than myself.  I am delighted to hear they have taken myhint, and that we are to meet at their gruesome board.""If I accept," said I, with the austerity he deserved."If you don't," rejoined Raffles, "you will miss some sport after bothour hearts.  Think of it, Bunny!  These fellows meet to wallow in allthe latest crimes; we wallow with them as though we knew more about itthan themselves.  Perhaps we don't, for few criminologists have a soulabove murder; and I quite expect to have the privilege of lifting thediscussion into our own higher walk.  They shall give their morbidminds to the fine art of burgling, for a change; and while we're aboutit, Bunny, we may as well extract their opinion of our noble selves.As authors, as collaborators, we will sit with the flower of ourcritics, and find our own level in the expert eye. It will be a piquantexperience, if not an invaluable one; if we are sailing too near thewind, we are sure to hear about it, and can trim our yards accordingly.Moreover, we shall get a very good dinner into the bargain, or ournoble host will belie a European reputation.""Do you know him?" I asked."We have a pavilion acquaintance, when it suits my lord," repliedRaffles, chuckling.  "But I know all about him.  He was president oneyear of the M.C.C., and we never had a better.  He knows the game,though I believe he never played cricket in his life.  But then heknows most things, and has never done any of them.  He has never evenmarried, and never opened his lips in the House of Lords. Yet they saythere is no better brain in the August assembly, and he certainly madeus a wonderful speech last time the Australians were over.  He has readeverything and (to his credit in these days) never written a line.  Allround he is a whale for theory and a sprat for practice--but he looksquite capable of both at crime!"I now longed to behold this remarkable peer, in the flesh, and with thegreater curiosity since another of the things which he evidently neverdid was to have his photograph published for the benefit of the vulgar.I told Raffles that I would dine with him at Lord Thornaby's, and henodded as though I had not hesitated for a moment. I see now how deftlyhe had disposed of my reluctance.  No doubt he had thought it all outbefore: his little speeches look sufficiently premeditated as I setthem down at the dictates of an excellent memory.  Let it, however, beborne in mind that Raffles did not talk exactly like a Raffles book: hesaid the things, but he did not say them in so many consecutivebreaths.  They were punctuated by puffs from his eternal cigarette, andthe punctuation was often in the nature of a line of asterisks, whilehe took a silent turn up and down his room.  Nor was he ever moredeliberate than when he seemed most nonchalant and spontaneous.  I cameto see it in the end.  But these were early days, in which he was moreplausible to me than I can hope to render him to another human being.And I saw a good deal of Raffles just then; it was, in fact, the oneperiod at which I can remember his coming round to see me morefrequently than I went round to him.  Of course he would come at hisown odd hours, often just as one was dressing to go out and dine, and Ican even remember finding him there when I returned, for I had longsince given him a key of the flat.  It was the inhospitable month ofFebruary, and I can recall more than one cosy evening when we discussedanything and everything but our own malpractices; indeed, there werenone to discuss just then.  Raffles, on the contrary, was showinghimself with some industry in the most respectable society, and by hisadvice I used the club more than ever."There is nothing like it at this time of year," said he.  "In thesummer I have my cricket to provide me with decent employment in thesight of men.  Keep yourself before the public from morning to night,and they'll never think of you in the still small hours."Our behavior, in fine, had so long been irreproachable that I rosewithout misgiving on the morning of Lord Thornaby's dinner to the otherCriminologists and guests.  My chief anxiety was to arrive under theaegis of my brilliant friend, and I had begged him to pick me up on hisway; but at five minutes to the appointed hour there was no sign ofRaffles or his cab.  We were bidden at a quarter to eight for eighto'clock, so after all I had to hurry off alone.Fortunately, Thornaby House is almost at the end of my street that was;and it seemed to me another fortunate circumstance that the house stoodback, as it did and does, in its own August courtyard; for, as I wasabout to knock, a hansom came twinkling in behind me, and I drew back,hoping it was Raffles at the last moment.  It was not, and I knew it intime to melt from the porch, and wait yet another minute in theshadows, since others were as late as I.  And out jumped these others,chattering in stage whispers as they paid their cab."Thornaby has a bet about it with Freddy Vereker, who can't come, Ihear.  Of course, it won t be lost or won to-night.  But the dear manthinks he's been invited as a cricketer!""I don't believe he's the other thing," said a voice as brusque as thefirst was bland.  "I believe it's all bunkum.  I wish I didn't, but Ido!""I think you'll find it's more than that," rejoined the other, as thedoors opened and swallowed the pair.I flung out limp hands and smote the air.  Raffles bidden to what hehad well called this "gruesome board," not as a cricketer but, clearly,as a suspected criminal!  Raffles wrong all the time, and I right foronce in my original apprehension!  And still no Raffles in sight--noRaffles to warn--no Raffles, and the clocks striking eight!Well may I shirk the psychology of such a moment, for my belief is thatthe striking clocks struck out all power of thought and feeling, andthat I played my poor part the better for that blessed surcease ofintellectual sensation.  On the other hand, I was never more alive tothe purely objective impressions of any hour of my existence, and ofthem the memory is startling to this day.  I hear my mad knock at thedouble doors; they fly open in the middle, and it is like somesumptuous and solemn rite.  A long slice of silken-legged lackey isseen on either hand; a very prelate of a butler bows a benediction fromthe sanctuary steps.  I breathe more freely when I reach a book-linedlibrary where a mere handful of men do not overflow the Persian rugbefore the fire.  One of them is Raffles, who is talking to a large manwith the brow of a demi-god and the eyes and jowl of a degeneratebulldog.  And this is our noble host.Lord Thornaby stared at me with inscrutable stolidity as we shookhands, and at once handed me over to a tall, ungainly man whom headdressed as Ernest, but whose surname I never learned.  Ernest in turnintroduced me, with a shy and clumsy courtesy, to the two remainingguests.  They were the pair who had driven up in the hansom; one turnedout to be Kingsmill, Q.C.; the other I knew at a glance from hisphotographs as Parrington, the backwoods novelist. They were admirablefoils to each other, the barrister being plump and dapper, with aNapoleonic cast of countenance, and the author one of the shaggiestdogs I have ever seen in evening-clothes. Neither took much stock ofme, but both had an eye on Raffles as I exchanged a few words with eachin turn.  Dinner, however, was immediately announced, and the six of ushad soon taken our places round a brilliant little table stranded in agreat dark room.I had not been prepared for so small a party, and at first I feltrelieved.  If the worst came to the worst, I was fool enough to say inmy heart, they were but two to one.  But I was soon sighing for thatsafety which the adage associates with numbers.  We were far too fewfor the confidential duologue with one's neighbor in which I, at least,would have taken refuge from the perils of a general conversation.  Andthe general conversation soon resolved itself into an attack, so subtlyconcerted and so artistically delivered that I could not conceive howRaffles should ever know it for an attack, and that against himself, orhow to warn him of his peril. But to this day I am not convinced that Ialso was honored by the suspicions of the club; it may have been so,and they may have ignored me for the bigger game.It was Lord Thornaby himself who fired the first shot, over the verysherry.  He had Raffles on his right hand, and the backwoodsman ofletters on his left.  Raffles was hemmed in by the law on his right,while I sat between Parrington and Ernest, who took the foot of thetable, and seemed a sort of feudatory cadet of the noble house.  But itwas the motley lot of us that my lord addressed, as he sat backblinking his baggy eyes."Mr. Raffles," said he, "has been telling me about that poor fellow whosuffered the extreme penalty last March.  A great end, gentlemen, agreat end!  It is true that he had been unfortunate enough to strike ajugular vein, but his own end should take its place among the mostglorious traditions of the gallows.  You tell them Mr. Raffles: it willbe as new to my friends as it is to me.""I tell the tale as I heard it last time I played at Trent Bridge; itwas never in the papers, I believe," said Raffles gravely.  "You mayremember the tremendous excitement over the Test Matches out inAustralia at the time: it seems that the result of the crucial game wasexpected on the condemned man's last day on earth, and he couldn't restuntil he knew it.  We pulled it off, if you recollect, and he said itwould make him swing happy.""Tell 'em what else he said!" cried Lord Thornaby, rubbing his podgyhands."The chaplain remonstrated with him on his excitement over a game atsuch a time, and the convict is said to have replied: 'Why, it's thefirst thing they'll ask me at the other end of the drop!'"The story was new even to me, but I had no time to appreciate itspoints.  My concern was to watch its effect upon the other members ofthe party.  Ernest, on my left, doubled up with laughter, and titteredand shook for several minutes.  My other neighbor, more impressionableby temperament, winced first, and then worked himself into a state ofenthusiasm which culminated in an assault upon his shirt-cuff with ajoiner's pencil.  Kingsmill, Q.C., beaming tranquilly on Raffles,seemed the one least impressed, until he spoke."I am glad to hear that," he remarked in a high bland voice.  "Ithought that man would die game.""Did you know anything about him, then?" inquired Lord Thornaby."I led for the Crown," replied the barrister, with a twinkle.  "Youmight almost say that I measured the poor man's neck."The point must have been quite unpremeditated; it was not the lesseffective for that.  Lord Thornaby looked askance at the callous silk.It was some moments before Ernest tittered and Parrington felt for hispencil; and in the interim I had made short work of my hock, though itwas Johannisberger.  As for Raffles, one had but to see his horror tofeel how completely he was off his guard."In itself, I have heard, it was not a sympathetic case?" was theremark with which he broke the general silence."Not a bit.""That must have been a comfort to you," said Raffles dryly."It would have been to me," vowed our author, while the barristermerely smiled.  "I should have been very sorry to have had a hand inhanging Peckham and Solomons the other day.""Why Peckham and Solomons?" inquired my lord."They never meant to kill that old lady.""But they strangled her in her bed with her own pillow-case!""I don't care," said the uncouth scribe.  "They didn't break in forthat.  They never thought of scragging her.  The foolish old personwould make a noise, and one of them tied too tight.  I call it jollybad luck on them.""On quiet, harmless, well-behaved thieves," added Lord Thornaby, "inthe unobtrusive exercise of their humble avocation."And, as he turned to Raffles with his puffy smile, I knew that we hadreached that part of the programme which had undergone rehearsal: ithad been perfectly timed to arrive with the champagne, and I was notafraid to signify my appreciation of that small mercy.  But Raffleslaughed so quickly at his lordship's humor, and yet with such a naturalrestraint, as to leave no doubt that he had taken kindly to my own oldpart, and was playing the innocent inimitably in his turn, by reason ofhis very innocence.  It was a poetic judgment on old Raffles, and in mymomentary enjoyment of the novel situation I was able to enjoy some ofthe good things of this rich man's table. The saddle of mutton morethan justified its place in the menu; but it had not spoiled me for mywing of pheasant, and I was even looking forward to a sweet, when afurther remark from the literary light recalled me from the table toits talk."But, I suppose," said he to Kingsmill, "it's many a burglar you'verestored to his friends and his relations'?""Let us say many a poor fellow who has been charged with burglary,"replied the cheery Q.C.  "It's not quite the same thing, you know, noris 'many' the most accurate word.  I never touch criminal work in town.""It's the only kind I should care about," said the novelist, eatingjelly with a spoon."I quite agree with you," our host chimed in.  "And of all thecriminals one might be called upon to defend, give me the enterprisingburglar.""It must be the breeziest branch of the business," remarked Raffles,while I held my breath.But his touch was as light as gossamer, and his artless manner atriumph of even his incomparable art.  Raffles was alive to the dangerat last.  I saw him refuse more champagne, even as I drained my glassagain.  But it was not the same danger to us both.  Raffles had noreason to feel surprise or alarm at such a turn in a conversationfrankly devoted to criminology; it must have been as inevitable to himas it was sinister to me, with my fortuitous knowledge of thesuspicions that were entertained.  And there was little to put him onhis guard in the touch of his adversaries, which was only less lightthan his own."I am not very fond of Mr. Sikes," announced the barrister, like a manwho had got his cue."But he was prehistoric," rejoined my lord.  "A lot of blood has flowedunder the razor since the days of Sweet William.""True; we have had Peace," said Parrington, and launched out into suchglowing details of that criminal's last moments that I began to hopethe diversion might prove permanent.  But Lord Thornaby was not to bedenied."William and Charles are both dead monarchs," said he.  "The reigningking in their department is the fellow who gutted poor Danby's place inBond Street."There was a guilty silence on the part of the three conspirators--for Ihad long since persuaded myself that Ernest was not in theirsecret--and then my blood froze."I know him well," said Raffles, looking up.Lord Thornaby stared at him in consternation.  The smile on theNapoleonic countenance of the barrister looked forced and frozen forthe first time during the evening.  Our author, who was nibbling cheesefrom a knife, left a bead of blood upon his beard.  The futile Ernestalone met the occasion with a hearty titter."What!" cried my lord.  "You know the thief?""I wish I did," rejoined Raffles, chuckling.  "No, Lord Thornaby, Ionly meant the jeweller, Danby.  I go to him when I want a weddingpresent."I heard three deep breaths drawn as one before I drew my own."Rather a coincidence," observed our host dryly, "for I believe youalso know the Milchester people, where Lady Melrose had her necklacestolen a few months afterward.""I was staying there at the time," said Raffles eagerly.  No snob wasever quicker to boast of basking in the smile of the great."We believe it to be the same man," said Lord Thornaby, speakingapparently for the Criminologists' Club, and with much less severity ofvoice."I only wish I could come across him," continued Raffles heartily."He's a criminal much more to my mind than your murderers who swear onthe drop or talk cricket in the condemned cell!""He might be in the house now," said Lord Thornaby, looking Raffles inthe face.  But his manner was that of an actor in an unconvincing partand a mood to play it gamely to the bitter end; and he seemedembittered, as even a rich man may be in the moment of losing a bet."What a joke if he were!" cried the Wild West writer."Absit omen!" murmured Raffles, in better taste."Still, I think you'll find it's a favorite time," argued Kingsmill,Q.C.  "And it would be quite in keeping with the character of this man,so far as it is known, to pay a little visit to the president of theCriminologists' Club, and to choose the evening on which he happens tobe entertaining the other members."There was more conviction in this sally than in that of our noble host;but this I attributed to the trained and skilled dissimulation of thebar.  Lord Thornaby, however, was not to be amused by the elaborationof his own idea, and it was with some asperity that he called upon thebutler, now solemnly superintending the removal of the cloth."Leggett!  Just send up-stairs to see if all the doors are open and therooms in proper order.  That's an awful idea of yours, Kingsmill, or ofmine!" added my lord, recovering the courtesy of his order by an effortthat I could follow.  "We should look fools.  I don't know which of usit was, by the way, who seduced the rest from the main stream of bloodinto this burglarious backwater.  Are you familiar with De Quincey'smasterpiece on 'Murder as a Fine Art,' Mr. Raffles?""I believe I once read it," replied Raffles doubtfully."You must read it again," pursued the earl.  "It is the last word on agreat subject; all we can hope to add is some baleful illustration orbloodstained footnote, not unworthy of De Quincey's text.  Well,Leggett?"The venerable butler stood wheezing at his elbow.  I had not hithertoobserved that the man was an asthmatic."I beg your lordship's pardon, but I think your lordship must haveforgotten."The voice came in rude gasps, but words of reproach could scarcely haveachieved a finer delicacy."Forgotten, Leggett!  Forgotten what, may I ask?""Locking your lordship's dressing-room door behind your lordship, mylord," stuttered the unfortunate Leggett, in the short spurts of awinded man, a few stertorous syllables at a time.  "Been up myself, mylord.  Bedroom door--dressing-room door--both locked inside!"But by this time the noble master was in worse case than the man. Hisfine forehead was a tangle of livid cords; his baggy jowl filled outlike a balloon.  In another second he had abandoned his place as ourhost and fled the room; and in yet another we had forgotten ours as hisguests and rushed headlong at his heels.Raffles was as excited as any of us now: he outstripped us all.  Thecherubic little lawyer and I had a fine race for the last place butone, which I secured, while the panting butler and his satellitesbrought up a respectful rear.  It was our unconventional author,however, who was the first to volunteer his assistance and advice."No use pushing, Thornaby!" cried he.  "If it's been done with a wedgeand gimlet, you may smash the door, but you'll never force it. Is therea ladder in the place?""There's a rope-ladder somewhere, in case of fire, I believe," said mylord vaguely, as he rolled a critical eye over our faces.  "Where is itkept, Leggett?""'William will fetch it, my lord."And a pair of noble calves went flashing to the upper regions."What's the good of bringing it down," cried Parrington, who had thrownback to the wilds in his excitement.  "Let him hang it out of thewindow above your own, and let me climb down and do the rest!  I'llundertake to have one or other of these doors open in two twos!"The fastened doors were at right angles on the landing which we filledbetween us.  Lord Thornaby smiled grimly on the rest of us, when he hadnodded and dismissed the author like a hound from the leash."It's a good thing we know something about our friend Parrington," saidmy lord.  "He takes more kindly to all this than I do, I can tell you.""It's grist to his mill," said Raffles charitably."Exactly!  We shall have the whole thing in his next book.""I hope to have it at the Old Bailey first," remarked Kingsmill, Q.C."Refreshing to find a man of letters such a man of action too!"It was Raffles who said this, and the remark seemed rather trite forhim, but in the tone there was a something that just caught my privateear.  And for once I understood: the officious attitude of Parrington,without being seriously suspicious in itself, was admirably calculatedto put a previously suspected person in a grateful shade.  Thisliterary adventurer had elbowed Raffles out of the limelight, andgratitude for the service was what I had detected in Raffles's voice.No need to say how grateful I felt myself.  But my gratitude was shotwith flashes of unwonted insight. Parrington was one of those whosuspected Raffles, or, at all events, one who was in the secret ofthose suspicions.  What if he had traded on the suspect's presence inthe house?  What if he were a deep villain himself, and the villain ofthis particular piece? I had made up my mind about him, and that in atithe of the time I take to make it up as a rule, when we heard my manin the dressing-room.  He greeted us with an impudent shout; in a fewmoments the door was open, and there stood Parrington, flushed anddishevelled, with a gimlet in one hand and a wedge in the other.Within was a scene of eloquent disorder.  Drawers had been pulled out,and now stood on end, their contents heaped upon the carpet. Wardrobedoors stood open; empty stud-cases strewed the floor; a clock, tied upin a towel, had been tossed into a chair at the last moment.  But along tin lid protruded from an open cupboard in one corner.  And onehad only to see Lord Thornaby's wry face behind the lid to guess thatit was bent over a somewhat empty tin trunk."What a rum lot to steal!" said he, with a twitch of humor at thecorners of his canine mouth.  "My peer's robes, with coronet complete!"We rallied round him in a seemly silence.  I thought our scribe wouldput in his word.  But even he either feigned or felt a proper awe."You may say it was a rum place to keep 'em," continued Lord Thornaby."But where would you gentlemen stable your white elephants?  And thesewere elephants as white as snow; by Jove, I'll job them for the future!"And he made merrier over his loss than any of us could have imaginedthe minute before; but the reason dawned on me a little later, when weall trooped down-stairs, leaving the police in possession of thetheatre of crime.  Lord Thornaby linked arms with Raffles as he led theway.  His step was lighter, his gayety no longer sardonic; his verylooks had improved.  And I divined the load that had been lifted fromthe hospitable heart of our host."I only wish," said he, "that this brought us any nearer to theidentity of the gentleman we were discussing at dinner, for, of course,we owe it to all our instincts to assume that it was he.""I wonder!" said old Raffles, with a foolhardy glance at me."But I'm sure of it, my dear sir," cried my lord.  "The audacity is hisand his alone.  I look no further than the fact of his honoring me onthe one night of the year when I endeavor to entertain my brotherCriminologists.  That's no coincidence, sir, but a deliberate irony,which would have occurred to no other criminal mind in England.""You may be right," Raffles had the sense to say this time, though Iflattered myself it was my face that made him."What is still more certain," resumed our host, "is that no othercriminal in the world would have crowned so delicious a conception withso perfect an achievement.  I feel sure the inspector will agree withus."The policeman in command had knocked and been admitted to the libraryas Lord Thornaby spoke."I didn't hear what you said, my lord.""Merely that the perpetrator of this amusing outrage can be no otherthan the swell mobsman who relieved Lady Melrose of her necklace andpoor Danby of half his stock a year or two ago.""I believe your lordship has hit the nail on the head.""The man who took the Thimblely diamonds and returned them to LordThimblely, you know.""Perhaps he'll treat your lordship the same.""Not he!  I don't mean to cry over my spilt milk.  I only wish thefellow joy of all he had time to take.  Anything fresh up-stain by theway?""Yes, my lord: the robbery took place between a quarter past eight andthe half-hour.""How on earth do you know?""The clock that was tied up in the towel had stopped at twenty past.""Have you interviewed my man?""I have, my lord.  He was in your lordship's room until close on thequarter, and all was as it should be when he left it.""Then do you suppose the burglar was in hiding in the house?""It's impossible to say, my lord.  He's not in the house now, for hecould only be in your lordship's bedroom or dressing-room, and we havesearched every inch of both."Lord Thornaby turned to us when the inspector had retreated, caressinghis peaked cap."I told him to clear up these points first," he explained, jerking hishead toward the door.  "I had reason to think my man had beenneglecting his duties up there.  I am glad to find myself mistaken."I ought to have been no less glad to see my own mistake.  My suspicionsof our officious author were thus proved to have been as wild ashimself.  I owed the man no grudge, and yet in my human heart I feltvaguely disappointed.  My theory had gained color from his behaviorever since he had admitted us to the dressing-room; it had changed allat once from the familiar to the morose; and only now was I just enoughto remember that Lord Thornaby, having tolerated those familiarities aslong as they were connected with useful service, had administered arelentless snub the moment that service had been well and trulyperformed.But if Parrington was exonerated in my mind, so also was Rafflesreinstated in the regard of those who had entertained a far graver andmore dangerous hypothesis.  It was a miracle of good luck, acoincidence among coincidences, which had white-washed him in theirsight at the very moment when they were straining the expert eye tosift him through and through.  But the miracle had been performed, andits effect was visible in every face and audible in every voice. Iexcept Ernest, who could never have been in the secret; moreover, thatgay Criminologist had been palpably shaken by his first littleexperience of crime.  But the other three vied among themselves to dohonor where they had done injustice.  I heard Kingsmill, Q.C., tellingRaffles the best time to catch him at chambers, and promising a seat incourt for any trial he might ever like to hear. Parrington spoke of apresentation set of his books, and in doing homage to Raffles made hispeace with our host.  As for Lord Thornaby, I did overhear the name ofthe Athenaeum Club, a reference to his friends on the committee, and awhisper (as I thought) of Rule II.The police were still in possession when we went our several ways, andit was all that I could do to drag Raffles up to my rooms, though, as Ihave said, they were just round the corner.  He consented at last as alesser evil than talking of the burglary in the street; and in my roomsI told him of his late danger and my own dilemma, of the few words Ihad overheard in the beginning, of the thin ice on which he had cutfancy figures without a crack.  It was all very well for him.  He hadnever realized his peril.  But let him think of me--listening,watching, yet unable to lift a finger--unable to say one warning word.Raffles suffered me to finish, but a weary sigh followed the lastsymmetrical whiff of a Sullivan which he flung into my fire before hespoke."No, I won't have another, thank you.  I'm going to talk to you, Bunny.Do you really suppose I didn't see through these wiseacres from thefirst?"I flatly refused to believe he had done so before that evening.  Whyhad he never mentioned his idea to me?  It had been quite the otherway, as I indignantly reminded Raffles.  Did he mean me to believe hewas the man to thrust his head into the lion's mouth for fun? And whatpoint would there be in dragging me there to see the fun?"I might have wanted you, Bunny.  I very nearly did.""For my face?""It has been my fortune before to-night, Bunny.  It has also given memore confidence than you are likely to believe at this time of day.You stimulate me more than you think.""Your gallery and your prompter's box in one?""Capital, Bunny!  But it was no joking matter with me either, my dearfellow; it was touch-and-go at the time.  I might have called on you atany moment, and it was something to know I should not have called invain.""But what to do, Raffles?""Fight our way out and bolt!" he answered, with a mouth that meant it,and a fine gay glitter of the eyes.I shot out of my chair."You don't mean to tell me you had a hand in the job?""I had the only hand in it, my dear Bunny.""Nonsense!  You were sitting at table at the time.  No, but you mayhave taken some other fellow into the show.  I always thought youwould!""One's quite enough, Bunny," said Raffles dryly; he leaned back in hischair and took out another cigarette.  And I accepted of yet anotherfrom his case; for it was no use losing one's temper with Raffles; andhis incredible statement was not, after all, to be ignored."Of course," I went on, "if you really had brought off this thing onyour own, I should be the last to criticise your means of reaching suchan end.  You have not only scored off a far superior force, which hadlaid itself out to score off you, but you have put them in the wrongabout you, and they'll eat out of your hand for the rest of their days.But don't ask me to believe that you've done all this alone!  ByGeorge," I cried, in a sudden wave of enthusiasm, "I don't care howyou've done it or who has helped you. It's the biggest thing you everdid in your life!"And certainly I had never seen Raffles look more radiant, or betterpleased with the world and himself, or nearer that elation which heusually left to me."Then you shall hear all about it, Bunny, if you'll do what I ask you.""Ask away, old chap, and the thing's done.""Switch off the electric lights.""All of them?""I think so.""There, then.""Now go to the back window and up with the blind.""Well?""I'm coming to you.  Splendid!  I never had a look so late as this.It's the only window left alight in the house!"His cheek against the pane, he was pointing slightly downward and verymuch aslant through a long lane of mews to a little square light like ayellow tile at the end.  But I had opened the window and leaned outbefore I saw it for myself."You don't mean to say that's Thornaby House?"I was not familiar with the view from my back windows."Of course I do, you rabbit!  Have a look through your own race-glass.It has been the most useful thing of all."But before I had the glass in focus more scales had fallen from myeyes; and now I knew why I had seen so much of Raffles these last fewweeks, and why he had always come between seven and eight o'clock inthe evening, and waited at this very window, with these very glasses athis eyes.  I saw through them sharply now.  The one lighted windowpointed out by Raffles came tumbling into the dark circle of my vision.I could not see into the actual room, but the shadows of those withinwere quite distinct on the lowered blind.  I even thought a blackthread still dangled against the square of light.  It was, it must be,the window to which the intrepid Parrington had descended from the oneabove."Exactly!" said Raffles in answer to my exclamation.  "And that's thewindow I have been watching these last few weeks.  By daylight you cansee the whole lot above the ground floor on this side of the house; andby good luck one of them is the room in which the master of the housearrays himself in all his nightly glory.  It was easily spotted bywatching at the right time.  I saw him shaved one morning before youwere up!  In the evening his valet stays behind to put things straight;and that has been the very mischief. In the end I had to find outsomething about the man, and wire to him from his girl to meet heroutside at eight o'clock.  Of course he pretends he was at his post atthe time: that I foresaw, and did the poor fellow's work before my own.I folded and put away every garment before I permitted myself to ragthe room.""I wonder you had time!""It took me one more minute, and it put the clock on exactly fifteen.By the way, I did that literally, of course, in the case of the clockthey found.  It's an old dodge, to stop a clock and alter the time; butyou must admit that it looked as though one had wrapped it up all readyto cart away.  There was thus any amount of prima-fade evidence of therobbery having taken place when we were all at table.  As a matter offact, Lord Thornaby left his dressing-room one minute, his valetfollowed him the minute after, and I entered the minute after that.""Through the window?""To be sure.  I was waiting below in the garden.  You have to pay foryour garden in town, in more ways than one.  You know the wall, ofcourse, and that jolly old postern?  The lock was beneath contempt.""But what about the window?  It's on the first floor, isn't it?"Raffles took up the cane which he had laid down with his overcoat. Itwas a stout bamboo with a polished ferule.  He unscrewed the ferule,and shook out of the cane a diminishing series of smaller canes,exactly like a child's fishing-rod, which I afterward found to havebeen their former state.  A double hook of steel was now produced andquickly attached to the tip of the top joint; then Raffles undid threebuttons of his waistcoat; and lapped round and round his waist was thefinest of Manila ropes, with the neatest of foot-loops at regularintervals."Is it necessary to go any further?" asked Raffles when he had unwoundthe rope.  "This end is made fast to that end of the hook, the otherhalf of the hook fits over anything that comes its way, and you leaveyour rod dangling while you swarm up your line.  Of course, you mustknow what you've got to hook on to; but a man who has had a porcelainbath fixed in his dressing-room is the man for me.  The pipes were alloutside, and fixed to the wall in just the right place.  You see I hadmade a reconnaissance by day in addition to many by night; it wouldhardly have been worth while constructing my ladder on chance.""So you made it on purpose!""My dear Bunny," said Raffles, as he wound the hemp girdle round hiswaist once more, "I never did care for ladder work, but I always saidthat if I ever used a ladder it should be the best of its kind yetinvented.  This one may come in useful again.""But how long did the whole thing take you?""From mother earth, to mother earth?  About five minutes, to-night, andone of those was spent in doing another man's work.""What!" I cried.  "You mean to tell me you climbed up and down, in andout, and broke into that cupboard and that big tin box, and wedged upthe doors and cleared out with a peer's robes and all the rest of it infive minutes?""Of course I don't, and of course I didn't.""Then what do you mean, and what did you do?""Made two bites at the cherry, Bunny!  I had a dress rehearsal in thedead of last night, and it was then I took the swag.  Our noble friendwas snoring next door all the time, but the effort may still stand highamong my small exploits, for I not only took all I wanted, but left thewhole place exactly as I found it, and shut things after me like a goodlittle boy.  All that took a good deal longer; to-night I had simply torag the room a bit, sweep up some studs and links, and leave ampleevidence of having boned those rotten robes to-night.  That, if youcome to think of it, was what you writing chaps would call thequintessential Q.E.F.  I have not only shown these dear Criminologiststhat I couldn't possibly have done this trick, but that there's someother fellow who could and did, and whom they've been perfect asses toconfuse with me."You may figure me as gazing on Raffles all this time in mute and raptamazement.  But I had long been past that pitch.  If he had told me nowthat he had broken into the Bank of England, or the Tower, I should nothave disbelieved him for a moment.  I was prepared to go home with himto the Albany and find the regalia under his bed.  And I took down myovercoat as he put on his.  But Raffles would not hear of myaccompanying him that night."No, my dear Bunny, I am short of sleep and fed up with excitement. Youmayn't believe it--you may look upon me as a plaster devil--but thosefive minutes you wot of were rather too crowded even for my taste.  Thedinner was nominally at a quarter to eight, and I don't mind tellingyou now that I counted on twice as long as I had. But no one came untiltwelve minutes to, and so our host took his time.  I didn't want to bethe last to arrive, and I was in the drawing-room five minutes beforethe hour.  But it was a quicker thing than I care about, when all issaid."And his last word on the matter, as he nodded and went his way, maywell be mine; for one need be no criminologist, much less a member ofthe Criminologists' Club, to remember what Raffles did with the robesand coronet of the Right Hon. the Earl of Thornaby, K.G.  He did withthem exactly what he might have been expected to do by the gentlemenwith whom he had foregathered; and he did it in a manner socharacteristic of himself as surely to remove from their minds the lastaura of the idea that he and himself were the same person. CarterPaterson was out of the question, and any labelling or addressing to beavoided on obvious grounds.  But Raffles stabled the white elephants inthe cloak-room at Charing Cross--and sent Lord Thornaby the ticket.The Field of PhillipiNipper Nasmyth had been head of our school when Raffles was captain ofcricket. I believe he owed his nickname entirely to the popularprejudice against a day-boy; and in view of the special reproach whichthe term carried in my time, as also of the fact that his father wasone of the school trustees, partner in a banking firm of fourresounding surnames, and manager of the local branch, there can belittle doubt that the stigma was undeserved.  But we did not think sothen, for Nasmyth was unpopular with high and low, and appeared toglory in the fact.  A swollen conscience caused him to see and heareven more than was warranted by his position, and his uncompromisingnature compelled him to act on whatsoever he heard or saw: a savagecustodian of public morals, he had in addition a perverse enthusiasmfor lost causes, loved a minority for its own sake, and untenabletenets for theirs.  Such, at all events, was my impression of NipperNasmyth, after my first term, which was also his last I had neverspoken to him, but I had heard him speak with extraordinary force andfervor in the school debates.  I carried a clear picture of his unkempthair, his unbrushed coat, his dominant spectacles, his dogmatic jaw.And it was I who knew the combination at a glance, after years andyears, when the fateful whim seized Raffles to play once more in theOld Boys' Match, and his will took me down with him to participate inthe milder festivities of Founder's Day.It was, however, no ordinary occasion.  The bicentenary loomed but ayear ahead, and a movement was on foot to mark the epoch with anadequate statue of our pious founder.  A special meeting was to be heldat the school-house, and Raffles had been specially invited by the newhead master, a man of his own standing, who had been in the eleven withhim up at Cambridge.  Raffles had not been near the old place foryears; but I had never gone down since the day I left; and I will notdwell on the emotions which the once familiar journey awakened in myunworthy bosom.  Paddington was alive with Old Boys of all ages--butvery few of ours--if not as lively as we used to make it when we alllanded back for the holidays.  More of us had moustaches and cigarettesand "loud" ties.  That was all.  Yet of the throng, though two or threelooked twice and thrice at Raffles, neither he nor I knew a soul untilwe had to change at the junction near our journey's end, when, as Isay, it was I who recognized Nipper Nasmyth at sight.The man was own son of the boy we both remembered.  He had grown aragged beard and a moustache that hung about his face like a neglectedcreeper.  He was stout and bent and older than his years. But hespurned the platform with a stamping stride which even I remembered inan instant, and which was enough for Raffles before he saw the man'sface."The Nipper it is!" he cried.  "I could swear to that walk in apantomime procession!  See the independence in every step: that's hisheel on the neck of the oppressor: it's the nonconformist conscience inbaggy breeches.  I must speak to him, Bunny.  There was a lot of goodin the old Nipper, though he and I did bar each other."And in a moment he had accosted the man by the boy's nickname,obviously without thinking of an affront which few would have read inthat hearty open face and hand."My name's Nasmyth," snapped the other, standing upright to glare."Forgive me," said Raffles undeterred.  "One remembers a nickname andforgets all it never used to mean.  Shake hands, my dear fellow! I'mRaffles.  It must be fifteen years since we met.""At least," replied Nasmyth coldly; but he could no longer refuseRaffles his hand.  "So you are going down," he sneered, "to this greatgathering?"  And I stood listening at my distance, as though still inthe middle fourth."Rather!" cried Raffles.  "I'm afraid I have let myself lose touch, butI mean to turn over a new leaf.  I suppose that isn't necessary in yourcase, Nasmyth?"He spoke with an enthusiasm rare indeed in him: it had grown uponRaffles in the train; the spirit of his boyhood had come rushing backat fifty miles an hour.  He might have been following some honorablecalling in town; he might have snatched this brief respite from adistinguished but exacting career.  I am convinced that it was I alonewho remembered at that moment the life we were really leading at thattime.  With me there walked this skeleton through every waking hourthat was to follow.  I shall endeavor not to refer to it again.  Yet itshould not be forgotten that my skeleton was always there."It certainly is not necessary in my case," replied Nasmyth, still asstiff as any poker.  "I happen to be a trustee.""Of the school?""Like my father before me.""I congratulate you, my dear fellow!" cried the hearty Raffles--ayounger Raffles than I had ever known in town."I don't know that you need," said Nasmyth sourly."But it must be a tremendous interest.  And the proof is that you'regoing down to this show, like all the rest of us.""No, I'm not.  I live there, you see."And I think the Nipper recalled that name as he ground his heel upon anunresponsive flagstone."But you're going to this meeting at the school-house, surely?""I don't know.  If I do there may be squalls.  I don't know what youthink about this precious scheme Raffles, but I..."The ragged beard stuck out, set teeth showed through the wildmoustache, and in a sudden outpouring we had his views.  They werenarrow and intemperate and perverse as any I had heard him advocate asthe firebrand of the Debating Society in my first term.  But they werestated with all the old vim and venom.  The mind of Nasmyth had notbroadened with the years, but neither had its natural force abated, northat of his character either.  He spoke with great vigor at the top ofhis voice; soon we had a little crowd about us; but the tall collarsand the broad smiles of the younger Old Boys did not deter our dowdydemagogue.  Why spend money on a man who had been dead two hundredyears?  What good could it do him or the school?  Besides, he was onlytechnically our founder.  He had not founded a great public school.  Hehad founded a little country grammar school which had pottered alongfor a century and a half.  The great public school was the growth ofthe last fifty years, and no credit to the pillar of piety. Besides, hewas only nominally pious.  Nasmyth had made researches, and he knew.And why throw good money after a bad man?"Are there many of your opinion?" inquired Raffles, when the agitatorpaused for breath.  And Nasmyth beamed on us with flashing eyes."Not one to my knowledge as yet," said he.  "But we shall see afterto-morrow night.  I hear it's to be quite an exceptional gathering thisyear; let us hope it may contain a few sane men.  There are none on thepresent staff, and I only know of one among the trustees!"Raffles refrained from smiling as his dancing eye met mine."I can understand your view," he said.  "I am not sure that I don'tshare it to some extent.  But it seems to me a duty to support ageneral movement like this even if it doesn't take the direction or theshape of our own dreams.  I suppose you yourself will give something,Nasmyth?""Give something?  I?  Not a brass farthing!" cried the implacablebanker.  "To do so would be to stultify my whole position.  I cordiallyand conscientiously disapprove of the whole thing, and shall use all myinfluence against it.  No, my good sir, I not only don't subscribemyself, but I hope to be the means of nipping a good many subscriptionsin the bud."I was probably the only one who saw the sudden and yet subtle change inRaffles--the hard mouth, the harder eye.  I, at least, might haveforeseen the sequel then and there.  But his quiet voice betrayednothing, as he inquired whether Nasmyth was going to speak at nextnight's meeting.  Nasmyth said he might, and certainly warned us whatto expect.  He was still fulminating when our train came in."Then we meet again at Philippi," cried Raffles in gay adieu.  "For youhave been very frank with us all, Nasmyth, and I'll be frank enough inmy turn to tell you that I've every intention of speaking on the otherside!"It happened that Raffles had been asked to speak by his old collegefriend, the new head master.  Yet it was not at the school-house thathe and I were to stay, but at the house that we had both been in asboys.  It also had changed hands: a wing had been added, and the doubletier of tiny studies made brilliant with electric light. But the quadand the fives-courts did not look a day older; the ivy was no thickerround the study windows; and in one boy's castle we found thetraditional print of Charing Cross Bridge which had knocked about ourstudies ever since a son of the contractor first sold it when he left.Nay, more, there was the bald remnant of a stuffed bird which had beenmy own daily care when it and I belonged to Raffles.  And when we allfiled in to prayers, through the green baize door which still separatedthe master's part of the house from that of the boys, there was a smallboy posted in the passage to give the sign of silence to the restassembled in the hall, quite identically as in the dim old days; thepicture was absolutely unchanged; it was only we who were out of it inbody and soul.On our side of the baize door a fine hospitality and a finer flow ofspirits were the order of the night.  There was a sound representativeassortment of quite young Old Boys, to whom ours was a prehistorictime, and in the trough of their modern chaff and chat we old stagersmight well have been left far astern of the fun.  Yet it was Raffleswho was the life and soul of the party, and that not by meretriciousvirtue of his cricket.  There happened not to be another cricketeramong us, and it was on their own subjects that Raffles laughed withthe lot in turn and in the lump.  I never knew him in quite such form.I will not say he was a boy among them, but he was that rarer being,the man of the world who can enter absolutely into the fun and fervorof the salad age.  My cares and my regrets had never been more acute,but Raffles seemed a man without either in his life.He was not, however, the hero of the Old Boys' Match, and that wasexpected of him by all the school.  There was a hush when he went in, agroan when he came out.  I had no reason to suppose he was not trying;these things happen to the cricketer who plays out of his class; butwhen the great Raffles went on to bowl, and was hit all over the field,I was not so sure.  It certainly failed to affect his spirits; he wasmore brilliant than ever at our hospitable board; and after dinner camethe meeting at which he and Nasmyth were to speak.It was a somewhat frigid gathering until Nasmyth rose.  We had alldined with our respective hosts, and then repaired to this business incold blood.  Many were lukewarm about it in their hearts; there was acertain amount of mild prejudice, and a greater amount of animalindifference, to be overcome in the opening speech.  It is not for meto say whether this was successfully accomplished.  I only know how thetemperature of that meeting rose with Nipper Nasmyth.And I dare say, in all the circumstances of the case, his really was arather vulgar speech.  But it was certainly impassioned, and probablyas purely instinctive as his denunciation of all the causes whichappeal to the gullible many without imposing upon the cantankerous few.His arguments, it is true, were merely an elaboration of those withwhich he had favored some of us already; but they were pointed by aconcise exposition of the several definite principles they represented,and barbed with a caustic rhetoric quite admirable in itself.  In aword, the manner was worthy of the very foundation it sought to shake,or we had never swallowed such matter without a murmur.  As it was,there was a demonstration in the wilderness when the voice ceasedcrying.  But we sat in the deeper silence when Raffles rose to reply.I leaned forward not to lose a word.  I knew my Raffles so well that Ifelt almost capable of reporting his speech before I heard it.  Neverwas I more mistaken, even in him!  So far from a gibe for a gibe and ataunt for a taunt, there never was softer answer than that which A. J.Raffles returned to Nipper Nasmyth before the staring eyes and startledears of all assembled.  He courteously but firmly refused to believe aword his old friend Nasmyth had said--about himself.  He had knownNasmyth for twenty years, and never had he met a dog who barked so loudand bit so little.  The fact was that he had far too kind a heart tobite at all.  Nasmyth might get up and protest as loud as he liked: thespeaker declared he knew him better than Nasmyth knew himself.  He hadthe necessary defects of his great qualities.  He was only too good asportsman.  He had a perfect passion for the weaker side.  That aloneled Nasmyth into such excesses of language as we had all heard from hislips that night.  As for Raffles, he concluded his far too genialremarks by predicting that, whatever Nasmyth might say or think of thenew fund, he would subscribe to it as handsomely as any of us, like"the generous good chap" that we all knew him to be.Even so did Raffles disappoint the Old Boys in the evening as he haddisappointed the school by day.  We had looked to him for a nobleraillery, a lofty and loyal disdain, and he had fobbed us off withfriendly personalities not even in impeccable taste. Nevertheless, thislight treatment of a grave offence went far to restore the naturalamenities of the occasion.  It was impossible even for Nasmyth to replyto it as he might to a more earnest onslaught.  He could but smilesardonically, and audibly undertake to prove Raffles a false prophet;and though subsequent speakers were less merciful the note was struck,and there was no more bad blood in the debate.  There was plenty,however, in the veins of Nasmyth, as I was to discover for myselfbefore the night was out.You might think that in the circumstances he would not have attendedthe head master's ball with which the evening ended; but that would besadly to misjudge so perverse a creature as the notorious Nipper. Hewas probably one of those who protest that there is "nothing personal"in their most personal attacks.  Not that Nasmyth took this tone aboutRaffles when he and I found ourselves cheek by jowl against theballroom wall; he could forgive his franker critics, but not thefriendly enemy who had treated him so much more gently than he deserved."I seem to have seen you with this great man Raffles," began Nasmyth,as he overhauled me with his fighting eye.  "Do you know him well?""Intimately.""I remember now.  You were with him when he forced himself upon me onthe way down yesterday.  He had to tell me who he was.  Yet he talks asthough we were old friends.""You were in the upper sixth together," I rejoined, nettled by his tone."What does that matter?  I am glad to say I had too much self-respect,and too little respect for Raffles, ever to be a friend of his then. Iknew too many of the things he did," said Nipper Nasmyth.His fluent insults had taken my breath.  But in a lucky flash I saw myretort."You must have had special opportunities of observation, living in thetown," said I; and drew first blood between the long hair and theragged beard; but that was all."So he really did get out at nights?" remarked my adversary.  "Youcertainly give your friend away.  What's he doing now?"I let my eyes follow Raffles round the room before replying.  He waswaltzing with a master's wife--waltzing as he did everything else.Other couples seemed to melt before them.  And the woman on his armlooked a radiant girl."I meant in town, or wherever he lives his mysterious life," explainedNasmyth, when I told him that he could see for himself. But his clevertone did not trouble me; it was his epithet that caused me to prick myears.  And I found some difficulty in following Raffles right round theroom."I thought everybody knew what he was doing; he's playing cricket mostof his time," was my measured reply; and if it bore an extra touch ofinsolence, I can honestly ascribe that to my nerves."And is that all he does for a living?" pursued my inquisitor keenly."You had better ask Raffles himself," said I to that.  "It's a pity youdidn't ask him in public, at the meeting!"But I was beginning to show temper in my embarrassment, and of coursethat made Nasmyth the more imperturbable."Really, he might be following some disgraceful calling, by the mysteryyou make of it!" he exclaimed.  "And for that matter I call first-classcricket a disgraceful calling, when it's followed by men who ought tobe gentlemen, but are really professionals in gentlemanly clothing.The present craze for gladiatorial athleticism I regard as one of thegreat evils of the age; but the thinly veiled professionalism of theso-called amateur is the greatest evil of that craze.  Men play for thegentlemen and are paid more than the players who walk out of anothergate.  In my time there was none of that.  Amateurs were amateurs andsport was sport; there were no Raffleses in first-class cricket then.I had forgotten Raffles was a modern first-class cricketer: thatexplains him.  Rather than see my son such another, do you know whatI'd prefer to see him?"I neither knew nor cared: yet a wretched premonitory fascination heldme breathless till I was told."I'd prefer to see him a thief!" said Nasmyth savagely; and when hiseyes were done with me, he turned upon his heel.  So that ended thatstage of my discomfiture.It was only to give place to a worse.  Was all this accident or felldesign?  Conscience had made a coward of me, and yet what reason had Ito disbelieve the worst?  We were pirouetting on the edge of an abyss;sooner or later the false step must come and the pit swallow us.  Ibegan to wish myself back in London, and I did get back to my room inour old house.  My dancing days were already over; there I had takenthe one resolution to which I remained as true as better men to bettervows; there the painful association was no mere sense of personalunworthiness.  I fell to thinking in my room of other dances ... andwas still smoking the cigarette which Raffles had taught me toappreciate when I looked up to find him regarding me from the door.  Hehad opened it as noiselessly as only Raffles could open doors, and nowhe closed it in the same professional fashion."I missed Achilles hours ago," said he.  "And still he's sulking in histent!""I have been," I answered, laughing as he could always make me, "butI'll chuck it if you'll stop and smoke.  Our host doesn't mind; there'san ash-tray provided for the purpose.  I ought to be sulking betweenthe sheets, but I'm ready to sit up with you till morning.""We might do worse; but, on the other hand, we might do still better,"rejoined Raffles, and for once he resisted the seductive Sullivan.  "Asa matter of fact, it's morning now; in another hour it will be dawn;and where could day dawn better than in Warfield Woods, or along theStockley road, or even on the Upper or the Middle?  I don't want toturn in, any more than you do.  I may as well confess that the wholeshow down here has exalted me more than anything for years.  But if wecan't sleep, Bunny, let's have some fresh air instead.""Has everybody gone to bed?" I asked."Long ago.  I was the last in.  Why?""Only it might sound a little odd, our turning out again, if they wereto hear us."Raffles stood over me with a smile made of mischief and cunning; but itwas the purest mischief imaginable, the most innocent and comic cunning."They shan't hear us at all, Bunny," said he.  "I mean to get out as Idid in the good old nights.  I've been spoiling for the chance eversince I came down.  There's not the smallest harm in it now; and ifyou'll come with me I'll show you how it used to be done.""But I know," said I.  "Who used to haul up the rope after you, and letit down again to the minute?"Raffles looked down on me from lowered lids, over a smile too humorousto offend."My dear good Bunny!  And do you suppose that even then I had only oneway of doing a thing?  I've had a spare loophole all my life, and whenyou're ready I'll show you what it was when I was here. Take off thoseboots, and carry your tennis-shoes; slip on another coat; put out yourlight; and I'll meet you on the landing in two minutes."He met me with uplifted finger, and not a syllable; and down-stairs heled me, stocking soles close against the skirting, two feet to eachparticular step.  It must have seemed child's play to Raffles; the oldprecautions were obviously assumed for my entertainment; but I confessthat to me it was all refreshingly exciting--for once without a risk ofdurance if we came to grief!  With scarcely a creak we reached thehall, and could have walked out of the street door without danger ordifficulty.  But that would not do for Raffles.  He must needs lead meinto the boys' part, through the green baize door.  It took a deal ofopening and shutting, but Raffles seemed to enjoy nothing better thanthese mock obstacles, and in a few minutes we were resting with sharpears in the boys' hall."Through these windows?" I whispered, when the clock over the piano hadhad matters its own way long enough to make our minds quite easy."How else?" whispered Raffles, as he opened the one on whose ledge ourletters used to await us of a morning."And then through the quad--""And over the gates at the end.  No talking, Bunny; there's a dormitoryjust overhead; but ours was in front, you remember, and if they hadever seen me I should have nipped back this way while they werewatching the other."His finger was on his lips as we got out softly into the starlight. Iremember how the gravel hurt as we left the smooth flagged margin ofthe house for the open quad; but the nearer of two long green seats(whereon you prepared your construe for the second-school in the summerterm) was mercifully handy; and once in our rubber soles we had nodifficulty in scaling the gates beyond the fives-courts. Moreover, wedropped into a very desert of a country road, nor saw a soul when wedoubled back beneath the outer study windows, nor heard a footfall inthe main street of the slumbering town.  Our own fell like thenight-dews and the petals of the poet; but Raffles ran his arm throughmine, and would chatter in whispers as we went."So you and Nipper had a word--or was it words?  I saw you out of thetail of my eye when I was dancing, and I heard you out of the tail ofmy ear.  It sounded like words, Bunny, and I thought I caught my name.He's the most consistent man I know, and the least altered from a boy.But he'll subscribe all right, you'll see, and be very glad I made him."I whispered back that I did not believe it for a moment.  Raffles hadnot heard all Nasmyth had said of him.  And neither would he listen tothe little I meant to repeat to him; he would but reiterate aconviction so chimerical to my mind that I interrupted in my turn toask him what ground he had for it."I've told you already," said Raffles.  "I mean to make him.""But how?" I asked.  "And when, and where?""At Philippi, Bunny, where I said I'd see him.  What a rabbit you areat a quotation!  "'And I think that the field of Philippi     Was where Caesar came to an end;       But who gave old Brutus the tip, I          Can't comprehend!'"You may have forgotten your Shakespeare, Bunny, but you ought toremember that."And I did, vaguely, but had no idea what it or Raffles meant, as Iplainly told him."The theatre of war," he answered--"and here we are at the stage door!"Raffles had stopped suddenly in his walk.  It was the last dark hour ofthe summer night, but the light from a neighboring lamppost showed methe look on his face as he turned."I think you also inquired when," he continued.  "Well, then, thisminute--if you will give me a leg up!"And behind him, scarcely higher than his head, and not even barred, wasa wide window with a wire blind, and the name of Nasmyth among otherslettered in gold upon the wire."You're never going to break in?""This instant, if you'll, help me; in five or ten minutes, if youwon't.""Surely you didn't bring the--the tools?"He jingled them gently in his pocket."Not the whole outfit, Bunny.  But you never know when you mayn't wantone or two.  I'm only thankful I didn't leave the lot behind this time.I very nearly did.""I must say I thought you would, coming down here," I saidreproachfully."But you ought to be glad I didn't," he rejoined with a smile. "It'sgoing to mean old Nasmyth's subscription to the Founder's Fund, andthat's to be a big one, I promise you!  The lucky thing is that I wentso far as to bring my bunch of safekeys.  Now, are you going to help meuse them, or are you not?  If so, now's your minute; if not, clear outand be--""Not so fast, Raffles," said I testily.  "You must have planned thisbefore you came down, or you would never have brought all those thingswith you.""My dear Bunny, they're a part of my kit!  I take them wherever I takemy evening-clothes.  As to this potty bank, I never even thought of it,much less that it would become a public duty to draw a hundred or sowithout signing for it.  That's all I shall touch, Bunny--I'm not onthe make to-night.  There's no risk in it either.  If I am caught Ishall simply sham champagne and stand the racket; it would be anobvious frolic after what happened at that meeting.  And they willcatch me, if I stand talking here: you run away back to bed--unlessyou're quite determined to 'give old Brutus the tip!'"Now we had barely been a minute whispering where we stood, and thewhole street was still as silent as the tomb.  To me there seemed leastdanger in discussing the matter quietly on the spot.  But even as hegave me my dismissal Raffles turned and caught the sill above him,first with one hand and then with the other.  His legs swung like apendulum as he drew himself up with one arm, then shifted the positionof the other hand, and very gradually worked himself waist-high withthe sill.  But the sill was too narrow for him; that was as far as hecould get unaided; and it was as much as I could bear to see of a featwhich in itself might have hardened my conscience and softened myheart.  But I had identified his doggerel verse at last.  I am ashamedto say that it was part of a set of my very own writing in the schoolmagazine of my time.  So Raffles knew the stuff better than I didmyself, and yet scorned to press his flattery to win me over!  He hadwon me: in a second my rounded shoulders were a pedestal for thosedangling feet.  And before many more I heard the old metallic snap,followed by the raising of a sash so slowly and gently as to be almostinaudible to me listening just below.Raffles went through hands first, disappeared for an instant, thenleaned out, lowering his hands for me."Come on, Bunny!  You're safer in than out.  Hang on to the sill andlet me get you under the arms.  Now all together--quietly does it--andover you come!"No need to dwell on our proceedings in the bank.  I myself had smallpart in the scene, being posted rather in the wings, at the foot of thestairs leading to the private premises in which the manager had hisdomestic being.  But I made my mind easy about him, for in the silenceof my watch I soon detected a nasal note overhead, and it was resonantand aggressive as the man himself.  Of Raffles, on the contrary, Iheard nothing, for he had shut the door between us, and I was to warnhim if a single sound came through.  I need scarcely add that nowarning was necessary during the twenty minutes we remained in thebank.  Raffles afterward assured me that nineteen of them had beenspent in filing one key; but one of his latest inventions was a littlethick velvet bag in which he carried the keys; and this bag had twoelastic mouths, which closed so tightly about either wrist that hecould file away, inside, and scarcely hear it himself.  As for thesekeys, they were clever counterfeits of typical patterns by two greatsafe-making firms.  And Raffles had come by them in a manner all hisown, which the criminal world may discover for itself.When he opened the door and beckoned to me, I knew by his face that hehad succeeded to his satisfaction, and by experience better than toquestion him on the point.  Indeed, the first thing was to get out ofthe bank; for the stars were drowning in a sky of ink and water, and itwas a comfort to feel that we could fly straight to our beds.  I saidso in whispers as Raffles cautiously opened our window and peeped out.In an instant his head was in, and for another I feared the worst."What was that, Bunny?  No, you don't, my son!  There's not a soul insight that I can see, but you never know, and we may as well lay ascent while we're about it.  Ready?  Then follow me, and never mind thewindow."With that he dropped softly into the street, and I after him, turningto the right instead of the left, and that at a brisk trot instead ofthe innocent walk which had brought us to the bank. Like mice wescampered past the great schoolroom, with its gable snipping a palersky than ever, and the shadows melting even in the colonnadeunderneath.  Masters' houses flitted by on the left, lesser landmarkson either side, and presently we were running our heads into the dawn,one under either hedge of the Stockley road."Did you see that light in Nab's just now?" cried Raffles as he led."No; why?" I panted, nearly spent."It was in Nab's dressing-room."Yes?""I've seen it there before," continued Raffles.  "He never was a goodsleeper, and his ears reach to the street.  I wouldn't like to say howoften I was chased by him in the small hours!  I believe he knew who itwas toward the end, but Nab was not the man to accuse you of what hecouldn't prove."I had no breath for comment.  And on sped Raffles like a yacht beforethe wind, and on I blundered like a wherry at sea, making heavy weatherall the way, and nearer foundering at every stride. Suddenly, to mydeep relief, Raffles halted, but only to tell me to stop my pipes whilehe listened."It's all right, Bunny," he resumed, showing me a glowing face in thedawn.  "History's on its own tracks once more, and I'll bet you it'sdear old Nab on ours!  Come on, Bunny; run to the last gasp, and leavethe rest to me."I was past arguing, and away he went.  There was no help for it but tofollow as best I could.  Yet I had vastly preferred to collapse on thespot, and trust to Raffles's resource, as before very long I must.  Ihad never enjoyed long wind and the hours that we kept in town may wellhave aggravated the deficiency.  Raffles, however, was in first-classtraining from first-class cricket, and he had no mercy on Nab or me.But the master himself was an old Oxford miler, who could still bear itbetter than I; nay, as I flagged and stumbled, I heard him poundingsteadily behind."Come on, come on, or he'll do us!" cried Raffles shrilly over hisshoulder; and a gruff sardonic laugh came back over mine.  It waspearly morning now, but we had run into a shallow mist that took me bythe throat and stabbed me to the lungs.  I coughed and coughed, andstumbled in my stride, until down I went, less by accident than to getit over, and so lay headlong in my tracks.  And old Nab dealt me averbal kick as he passed."You beast!" he growled, as I have known him growl it in form.But Raffles himself had abandoned the flight on hearing my downfall,and I was on hands and knees just in time to see the meeting betweenhim and old Nab.  And there stood Raffles in the silvery mist, laughingwith his whole light heart, leaning back to get the full flavor of hismirth; and, nearer me, sturdy old Nab, dour and grim, with beads of dewon the hoary beard that had been lamp-black in our time."So I've caught you at last!" said he.  "After more years than I meanto count!""Then you're luckier than we are, sir," answered Raffles, "for I fearour man has given us the slip.""Your man!" echoed Nab.  His bushy eyebrows had shot up: it was as muchas I could do to keep my own in their place."We were indulging in the chase ourselves," explained Raffles, "and oneof us has suffered for his zeal, as you can see.  It is even possiblethat we, too, have been chasing a perfectly innocent man.""Not to say a reformed character," said our pursuer dryly. "I supposeyou don't mean a member of the school?" he added, pinking his mansuddenly as of yore, with all the old barbed acumen.  But Raffles wasnow his match."That would be carrying reformation rather far, sir.  No, as I say, Imay have been mistaken in the first instance; but I had put out mylight and was looking out of the window when I saw a fellow behavingquite suspiciously.  He was carrying his boots and creeping along inhis socks--which must be why you never heard him, sir. They make lessnoise than rubber soles even--that is, they must, you know!  Well,Bunny had just left me, so I hauled him out and we both crept down toplay detective.  No sign of the fellow!  We had a look in thecolonnade--I thought I heard him--and that gave us no end of a hunt fornothing.  But just as we were leaving he came padding past under ournoses, and that's where we took up the chase.  Where he'd been in themeantime I have no idea; very likely he'd done no harm; but it seemedworth while finding out.  He had too good a start, though, and poorBunny had too bad a wind.""You should have gone on and let me rip," said I, climbing to my feetat last."As it is, however, we will all let the other fellow do so," said oldNab in a genial growl.  "And you two had better turn into my house andhave something to keep the morning cold out."You may imagine with what alacrity we complied; and yet I am bound toconfess that I had never liked Nab at school.  I still remember my termin his form.  He had a caustic tongue and  fine assortment of damagingepithets, most of which were levelled at my devoted skull during thosethree months.  I now discovered that he also kept a particularly mellowScotch whiskey, an excellent cigar, and a fund of anecdote of which amordant wit was the worthy bursar. Enough to add that he kept uslaughing in his study until the chapel bells rang him out.As for Raffles, he appeared to me to feel far more compunction for thefable which he had been compelled to foist upon one of the old mastersthan for the immeasurably graver offence against society and anotherOld Boy.  This, indeed, did not worry him at all; and the story wasreceived next day with absolute credulity on all sides.  Nasmythhimself was the first to thank us both for our spirited effort on hisbehalf; and the incident had the ironic effect of establishing animmediate entente cordiale between Raffles and his very latest victim.I must confess, however, that for my own part I was thoroughly uneasyduring the Old Boys' second innings, when Raffles made a selfish score,instead of standing by me to tell his own story in his own way.  Therewas never any knowing with what new detail he was about to embellishit: and I have still to receive full credit for the tact that itrequired to follow his erratic lead convincingly.  Seldom have I beenmore thankful than when our train started next morning, and the poor,unsuspecting Nasmyth himself waved us a last farewell from the platform."Lucky we weren't staying at Nab's," said Raffles, as he lit a Sullivanand opened his Daily Mail at its report of the robbery. "There was onething Nab would have spotted like the downy old bird he always was andwill be.""What was that?""The front door must have been found duly barred and bolted in themorning, and yet we let them assume that we came out that way.  Nabwould have pounced on the point, and by this time we might have beennabbed ourselves."It was but a little over a hundred sovereigns that Raffles had taken,and, of course, he had resolutely eschewed any and every form of papermoney.  He posted his own first contribution of twenty-five pounds tothe Founder's Fund immediately on our return to town, before rushingoff to more first-class cricket, and I gathered that the rest wouldfollow piecemeal as he deemed it safe. By an odd coincidence, however,a mysterious but magnificent donation of a hundred guineas was almostsimultaneously received in notes by the treasurer of the Founder'sFund, from one who simply signed himself "Old Boy."  The treasurerhappened to be our late host, the new man at our old house, and hewrote to congratulate Raffles on what he was pleased to consider adirect result of the latter's speech.  I did not see the letter thatRaffles wrote in reply, but in due course I heard the name of themysterious contributor.  He was said to be no other than Nipper Nasmythhimself. I asked Raffles if it was true.  He replied that he would askold Nipper point-blank if he came up as usual to the Varsity match, andif they had the luck to meet.  And not only did this happen, but I hadthe greater luck to be walking round the ground with Raffles when weencountered our shabby friend in front of the pavilion."My dear fellow," cried Raffles, "I hear it was you who gave thathundred guineas by stealth to the very movement you denounced. Don'tdeny it, and don't blush to find it fame.  Listen to me. There was agreat lot in what you said; but it's the kind of thing we ought all toback, whether we strictly approve of it in our hearts or not.""Exactly, Raffles, but the fact is--""I know what you're going to say.  Don't say it.  There's not one in athousand who would do as you've done, and not one in a million whowould do it anonymously.""But what makes you think I did it, Raffles?""Everybody is saying so.  You will find it all over the place when youget back.  You will find yourself the most popular man down there,Nasmyth!"I never saw a nobler embarrassment than that of this awkward, ungainly,cantankerous man: all his angles seemed to have been smoothed away:there was something quite human in the flushed, undecided, wistful face."I never was popular in my life," he said.  "I don't want to buy mypopularity now.  To be perfectly candid with you, Raffles--""Don't!  I can't stop to hear.  They're ringing the bell.  But youshouldn't have been angry with me for saying you were a generous goodchap, Nasmyth, when you were one all the time.  Good-by, old fellow!"But Nasmyth detained us a second more.  His hesitation was at an end.There was a sudden new light in his face."Was I?" he cried.  "Then I'll make it two hundred, and damn the odds!"Raffles was a thoughtful man as we went to our seats.  He saw nobody,would acknowledge no remark.  Neither did he attend to the cricket forthe first half-hour after lunch; instead, he eventually invited me tocome for a stroll on the practice ground, where, however, we found twochairs aloof from the fascinating throng."I am not often sorry, Bunny, as you know," he began.  "But I have beensorry since the interval.  I've been sorry for poor old Nipper Nasmyth.Did you see the idea of being popular dawn upon him for the first timein his life?""I did; but you had nothing to do with that, my dear man."Raffles shook his head over me as our eyes met.  "I had everything todo with it.  I tried to make him tell the meanest lie.  I made sure hewould, and for that matter he nearly did.  Then, at the last moment, hesaw how to hedge things with his conscience.  And his second hundredwill be a real gift.""You mean under his own name--""And with his own free-will.  My good Bunny, is it possible you don'tknow what I did with the hundred we drew from that bank!""I knew what you were going to do with it," said I.  "I didn't know youhad actually got further than the twenty-five you told me you weresending as your own contribution."Raffles rose abruptly from his chair."And you actually thought that came out of his money?""Naturally.""In my name?""I thought so."Raffles stared at me inscrutably for some moments, and for some more atthe great white numbers over the grand-stand."We may as well have another look at the cricket," said he.  "It'sdifficult to see the board from here, but I believe there's another manout."A Bad NightThere was to be a certain little wedding in which Raffles and I took asurreptitious interest.  The bride-elect was living in some retirement,with a recently widowed mother and an asthmatical brother, in a mellowhermitage on the banks of the Mole.  The bridegroom was a prosperousson of the same suburban soil which had nourished both families forgenerations.  The wedding presents were so numerous as to fill severalrooms at the pretty retreat upon the Mole, and of an intrinsic valuecalling for a special transaction with the Burglary Insurance Companyin Cheapside.  I cannot say how Raffles obtained all this information.I only know that it proved correct in each particular.  I was notindeed deeply interested before the event, since Raffles assured methat it was "a one-man job," and naturally intended to be the one manhimself. It was only at the eleventh hour that our positions wereinverted by the wholly unexpected selection of Raffles for the Englishteam in the Second Test Match.In a flash I saw the chance of my criminal career.  It was some yearssince Raffles had served his country in these encounters; he had neverthought to be called upon again, and his gratification was only lessthan his embarrassment.  The match was at Old Trafford, on the thirdThursday, Friday, and Saturday in July; the other affair had been allarranged for the Thursday night, the night of the wedding at EastMolesey.  It was for Raffles to choose between the two excitements, andfor once I helped him to make up his mind.  I duly pointed out to himthat in Surrey, at all events, I was quite capable of taking his place.Nay, more, I insisted at once on my prescriptive right and on hispatriotic obligation in the matter.  In the country's name and in myown, I implored him to give it and me a chance; and for once, as I say,my arguments prevailed.  Raffles sent his telegram--it was the daybefore the match.  We then rushed down to Esher, and over every inch ofthe ground by that characteristically circuitous route which heenjoined on me for the next night.  And at six in the evening I wasreceiving the last of my many instructions through a window of therestaurant car."Only promise me not to take a revolver," said Raffles in a whisper."Here are my keys; there's an old life-preserver somewhere in thebureau; take that, if you like--though what you take I rather fear youare the chap to use!""Then the rope be round my own neck!" I whispered back.  "Whatever elseI may do, Raffles, I shan't give you away; and you'll find I do betterthan you think, and am worth trusting with a little more to do, or I'llknow the reason why!"And I meant to know it, as he was borne out of Euston with raisedeyebrows, and I turned grimly on my heel.  I saw his fears for me; andnothing could have made me more fearless for myself.  Raffles had beenwrong about me all these years; now was my chance to set him right.  Itwas galling to feel that he had no confidence in my coolness or mynerve, when neither had ever failed him at a pinch. I had been loyal tohim through rough and smooth.  In many an ugly corner I had stood asfirm as Raffles himself.  I was his right hand, and yet he neverhesitated to make me his catspaw.  This time, at all events, I shouldbe neither one nor the other; this time I was the understudy playinglead at last; and I wish I could think that Raffles ever realized withwhat gusto I threw myself into his part.Thus I was first out of a crowded theatre train at Esher next night,and first down the stairs into the open air.  The night was close andcloudy; and the road to Hampton Court, even now that the suburbanbuilder has marked much of it for his own, is one of the darkest Iknow.  The first mile is still a narrow avenue, a mere tunnel of leavesat midsummer; but at that time there was not a lighted pane or crannyby the way.  Naturally, it was in this blind reach that I fancied I wasbeing followed.  I stopped in my stride; so did the steps I made sure Ihad heard not far behind; and when I went on, they followed suit.  Idried my forehead as I walked, but soon brought myself to repeat theexperiment when an exact repetition of the result went to convince methat it had been my own echo all the time.  And since I lost it ongetting quit of the avenue, and coming out upon the straight and openroad, I was not long in recovering from my scare.  But now I could seemy way, and found the rest of it without mishap, though not withoutanother semblance of adventure. Over the bridge across the Mole, whenabout to turn to the left, I marched straight upon a policeman inrubber soles.  I had to call him "officer" as I passed, and to pass myturning by a couple of hundred yards, before venturing back another way.At last I had crept through a garden gate, and round by black windowsto a black lawn drenched with dew.  It had been a heating walk, and Iwas glad to blunder on a garden seat, most considerately placed under acedar which added its own darkness to that of the night.  Here I resteda few minutes, putting up my feet to keep them dry, untying my shoes tosave time, and generally facing the task before me with a coolnesswhich I strove to make worthy of my absent chief.  But mine was aself-conscious quality, as far removed from the original as any otherdeliberate imitation of genius.  I actually struck a match on mytrousers, and lit one of the shorter Sullivans.  Raffles himself wouldnot have done such a thing at such a moment.  But I wished to tell himthat I had done it; and in truth I was not more than pleasurablyafraid; I had rather that impersonal curiosity as to the issue whichhas been the saving of me in still more precarious situations.  I evengrew impatient for the fray, and could not after all sit still as longas I had intended.  So it happened that I was finishing my cigarette onthe edge of the wet lawn, and about to slip off my shoes beforestepping across the gravel to the conservatory door, when a mostsingular sound arrested me in the act.  It was a muffled gaspingsomewhere overhead.  I stood like stone; and my listening attitude musthave been visible against the milky sheen of the lawn, for a laboredvoice hailed me sternly from a window."Who on earth are you?" it wheezed."A detective officer," I replied, "sent down by the Burglary InsuranceCompany."Not a moment had I paused for my precious fable.  It had all beenprepared for me by Raffles, in case of need.  I was merely repeating alesson in which I had been closely schooled.  But at the window therewas pause enough, filled only by the uncanny wheezing of the man Icould not see."I don't see why they should have sent you down," he said at length."We are being quite well looked after by the local police; they'regiving us a special call every hour.""I know that, Mr. Medlicott," I rejoined on my own account.  "I met oneof them at the corner just now, and we passed the time of night."My heart was knocking me to bits.  I had started for myself at last."Did you get my name from him?" pursued my questioner, in a suspiciouswheeze."No; they gave me that before I started," I replied.  "But I'm sorryyou saw me, sir; it's a mere matter of routine, and not intended toannoy anybody.  I propose to keep a watch on the place all night, but Iown it wasn't necessary to trespass as I've done.  I'll take myself offthe actual premises, if you prefer it."This again was all my own; and it met with a success that might havegiven me confidence."Not a bit of it," replied young Medlicott, with a grim geniality."I've just woke up with the devil of an attack of asthma, and may haveto sit up in my chair till morning.  You'd better come up and see methrough, and kill two birds while you're about it.  Stay where you are,and I'll come down and let you in."Here was a dilemma which Raffles himself had not foreseen!  Outside, inthe dark, my audacious part was not hard to play; but to carry theimprovisation in-doors was to double at once the difficulty and therisk.  It was true that I had purposely come down in a true detective'sovercoat and bowler; but my personal appearance was hardly of thedetective type.  On the other hand as the soi-disant guardian of thegifts one might only excite suspicion by refusing to enter the housewhere they were.  Nor could I forget that it was my purpose to effectsuch entry first or last.  That was the casting consideration.  Idecided to take my dilemma by the horns.There had been a scraping of matches in the room over the conservatory;the open window had shown for a moment, like an empty picture-frame, agigantic shadow wavering on the ceiling; and in the next half-minute Iremembered to tie my shoes.  But the light was slow to reappear throughthe leaded glasses of an outer door farther along the path.  And whenthe door opened, it was a figure of woe that stood within and held anunsteady candle between our faces.I have seen old men look half their age, and young men look doubletheirs; but never before or since have I seen a beardless boy bent intoa man of eighty, gasping for every breath, shaken by every gasp,swaying, tottering, and choking, as if about to die upon his feet.  Yetwith it all, young Medlicott overhauled me shrewdly, and it was severalmoments before he would let me take the candle from him."I shouldn't have come down--made me worse," he began whispering inspurts.  "Worse still going up again.  You must give me an arm. Youwill come up?  That's right!  Not as bad as I look, you know. Got somegood whiskey, too.  Presents are all right; but if they aren't you'llhear of it in-doors sooner than out.  Now I'm ready--thanks!  Mustn'tmake more noise than we can help--wake my mother."It must have taken us minutes to climb that single flight of stairs.There was just room for me to keep his arm in mine; with the other hehauled on the banisters; and so we mounted, step by step, a pantingpause on each, and a pitched battle for breath on the half-landing.  Inthe end we gained a cosey library, with an open door leading to abedroom beyond.  But the effort had deprived my poor companion of allpower of speech; his laboring lungs shrieked like the wind; he couldjust point to the door by which we had entered, and which I shut inobedience to his gestures, and then to the decanter and its accessorieson the table where he had left them overnight.  I gave him nearly halfa glassful, and his paroxysm subsided a little as he sat hunched up ina chair."I was a fool ... to turn in," he blurted in more whispers betweenlonger pauses.  "Lying down is the devil ... when you're in for a realbad night.  You might get me the brown cigarettes ... on the table inthere.  That's right ... thanks awfully ... and now a match!"The asthmatic had bitten off either end of the stramonium cigarette,and was soon choking himself with the crude fumes, which he inhaled indesperate gulps, to exhale in furious fits of coughing.  Never was moreheroic remedy; it seemed a form of lingering suicide; but by degreessome slight improvement became apparent, and at length the sufferer wasable to sit upright, and to drain his glass with a sigh of rare relief.I sighed also, for I had witnessed a struggle for dear life by a man inthe flower of his youth, whose looks I liked, whose smile came like thesun through the first break in his torments, and whose first words wereto thank me for the little I had done in bare humanity.That made me feel the thing I was.  But the feeling put me on my guard.And I was not unready for the remark which followed a more exhaustivescrutiny than I had hitherto sustained."Do you know," said young Medlicott, "that you aren't a bit like thedetective of my dreams?""Only to proud to hear it," I replied.  "There would be no point in mybeing in plain clothes if I looked exactly what I was."My companion reassured me with a wheezy laugh."There's something in that," said he, "although I do congratulate theinsurance people on getting a man of your class to do their dirty work.And I congratulate myself," he was quick enough to add, "on having youto see me through as bad a night as I've had for a long time.  You'relike flowers in the depths of winter.  Got a drink?  That's right!  Isuppose you didn't happen to bring down an evening paper?"I said I had brought one, but had unfortunately left it in the train."What about the Test Match?" cried my asthmatic, shooting forward inhis chair."I can tell you that," said I.  "We went in first--""Oh, I know all about that," he interrupted.  "I've seen the miserablescore up to lunch.  How many did we scrape altogether?""We're scraping them still.""No!  How many?""Over two hundred for seven wickets.""Who made the stand?""Raffles, for one.  He was 62 not out at close of play!"And the note of admiration rang in my voice, though I tried in myself-consciousness to keep it out.  But young Medlicott's enthusiasmproved an ample cloak for mine; it was he who might have been thepersonal friend of Raffles; and in his delight he chuckled till hepuffed and blew again."Good old Raffles!" he panted in every pause.  "After being chosenlast, and as a bowler-man!  That's the cricketer for me, sir; by Jove,we must have another drink in his honor!  Funny thing, asthma; yourliquor affects your head no more than it does a man with a snake-bite;but it eases everything else, and sees you through.  Doctors will tellyou so, but you've got to ask 'em first; they're no good for asthma!I've only known one who could stop an attack, and he knocked mesideways with nitrite of amyl.  Funny complaint in other ways; raisesyour spirits, if anything.  You can't look beyond the next breath.Nothing else worries you.  Well, well, here's luck to A. J. Raffles,and may he get his century in the morning!"And he struggled to his feet for the toast; but I drank it sittingdown.  I felt unreasonably wroth with Raffles, for coming into theconversation as he had done--for taking centuries in Test Matches as hewas doing, without bothering his head about me.  A failure would havebeen in better taste; it would have shown at least some imagination,some anxiety on one's account I did not reflect that even Raffles couldscarcely be expected to picture me in my cups with the son of the housethat I had come to rob; chatting with him, ministering to him; admiringhis cheery courage, and honestly attempting to lighten his load!  Trulyit was an infernal position: how could I rob him or his after this?And yet I had thrust myself into it; and Raffles would never, neverunderstand!Even that was not the worst.  I was not quite sure that young Medlicottwas sure of me.  I had feared this from the beginning, and now (overthe second glass that could not possibly affect a man in his condition)he practically admitted as much to me. Asthma was such a funny thing(he insisted) that it would not worry him a bit to discover that I hadcome to take the presents instead of to take care of them!  I showed asufficiently faint appreciation of the jest.  And it was presentlypunished as it deserved, by the most violent paroxysm that had seizedthe sufferer yet: the fight for breath became faster and more furious,and the former weapons of no more avail.  I prepared a cigarette, butthe poor brute was too breathless to inhale.  I poured out yet morewhiskey, but he put it from him with a gesture."Amyl--get me amyl!" he gasped.  "The tin on the table by my bed."I rushed into his room, and returned with a little tin of tinycylinders done up like miniature crackers in scraps of calico; thespent youth broke one in his handkerchief, in which he immediatelyburied his face.  I watched him closely as a subtle odor reached mynostrils; and it was like the miracle of oil upon the billows.  Hisshoulders rested from long travail; the stertorous gasping died away toa quick but natural respiration; and in the sudden cessation of thecruel contest, an uncanny stillness fell upon the scene. Meanwhile thehidden face had flushed to the ears, and, when at length it was raisedto mine, its crimson calm was as incongruous as an optical illusion."It takes the blood from the heart," he murmured, "and clears the wholeshow for the moment.  If it only lasted!  But you can't take twowithout a doctor; one's quite enough to make you smell the brimstone...I say, what's up?  You're listening to something! If it's the policemanwe'll have a word with him."It was not the policeman; it was no out-door sound that I had caught inthe sudden cessation of the bout for breath.  It was a noise, afootstep, in the room below us.  I went to the window and leaned out:right underneath, in the conservatory, was the faintest glimmer of alight in the adjoining room."One of the rooms where the presents are!" whispered Medlicott at myelbow.  And as we withdrew together, I looked him in the face as I hadnot done all night.I looked him in the face like an honest man, for a miracle was to makeme one once more.  My knot was cut--my course inevitable. Mine, afterall, to prevent the very thing that I had come to do! My gorge had longsince risen at the deed; the unforeseen circumstances had rendered itimpossible from the first; but now I could afford to recognize theimpossibility, and to think of Raffles and the asthmatic alike withouta qualm.  I could play the game by them both, for it was one and thesame game.  I could preserve thieves' honor, and yet regain some shredof that which I had forfeited as a man!So I thought as we stood face to face, our ears straining for the leastmovement below, our eyes locked in a common anxiety.  Another muffledfoot-fall--felt rather than heard--and we exchanged grim nods ofsimultaneous excitement.  But by this time Medlicott was as helpless ashe had been before; the flush had faded from his face, and hisbreathing alone would have spoiled everything.  In dumb show I had toorder him to stay where he was, to leave my man to me.  And then it wasthat in a gusty whisper, with the same shrewd look that haddisconcerted me more than once during our vigil, young Medlicott frozeand fired my blood by turns."I've been unjust to you," he said, with his right hand in hisdressing-gown pocket.  "I thought for a bit--never mind what Ithought--I soon saw I was wrong.  But--I've had this thing in my pocketall the time!"And he would have thrust his revolver upon me as a peace-offering, butI would not even take his hand, as I tapped the life-preserver in mypocket, and crept out to earn his honest grip or to fall in theattempt.  On the landing I drew Raffles's little weapon, slipped myright wrist through the leathern loop, and held it in readiness over myright shoulder.  Then, down-stairs I stole, as Raffles himself hadtaught me, close to the wall, where the planks are nailed.  Nor had Imade a sound, to my knowledge; for a door was open, and a light wasburning, and the light did not flicker as I approached the door.  Iclenched my teeth and pushed it open; and here was the veriest villainwaiting for me, his little lantern held aloft."You blackguard!" I cried, and with a single thwack I felled theruffian to the floor.There was no question of a foul blow.  He had been just as ready topounce on me; it was simply my luck to have got the first blow home.Yet a fellow-feeling touched me with remorse, as I stood over thesenseless body, sprawling prone, and perceived that I had struck anunarmed man.  The lantern only had fallen from his hands; it lay on oneside, smoking horribly; and a something in the reek caused me to set itup in haste and turn the body over with both hands.Shall I ever forget the incredulous horror of that moment?It was Raffles himself!How it was possible, I did not pause to ask myself; if one man on earthcould annihilate space and time, it was the man lying senseless at myfeet; and that was Raffles, without an instant's doubt.  He was invillainous guise, which I knew of old, now that I knew the unhappywearer.  His face was grimy, and dexterously plastered with a growth ofreddish hair; his clothes were those in which he had followed cabs fromthe London termini; his boots were muffled in thick socks; and I hadlaid him low with a bloody scalp that filled my cup of horror.  Igroaned aloud as I knelt over him and felt his heart.  And I wasanswered by a bronchial whistle from the door."Jolly well done!" cheered my asthmatical friend.  "I heard the wholething--only hope my mother didn't.  We must keep it from her if we can."I could have cursed the creature's mother from my full heart; yet evenwith my hand on that of Raffles, as I felt his feeble pulse, I toldmyself that this served him right.  Even had I brained him, the faulthad been his, not mine.  And it was a characteristic, an inveteratefault, that galled me for all my anguish: to trust and yet distrust meto the end, to race through England in the night, to spy upon me at hiswork--to do it himself after all!"Is he dead?" wheezed the asthmatic coolly."Not he," I answered, with an indignation that I dared not show."You must have hit him pretty hard," pursued young Medlicott, "but Isuppose it was a case of getting first knock.  And a good job you gotit, if this was his," he added, picking up the murderous littlelife-preserver which poor Raffles had provided for his own destruction."Look here," I answered, sitting back on my heels.  "He isn't dead, Mr.Medlicott, and I don't know how long he'll be as much as stunned. He'sa powerful brute, and you're not fit to lend a hand.  But thatpoliceman of yours can't be far away.  Do you think you could struggleout and look for him?""I suppose I am a bit better than I was," he replied doubtfully. "Theexcitement seems to have done me good.  If you like to leave me onguard with my revolver, I'll undertake that he doesn't escape me."I shook my head with an impatient smile."I should never hear the last of it," said I.  "No, in that case all Ican do is to handcuff the fellow and wait till morning if he won't goquietly; and he'll be a fool if he does, while there's a fightingchance."Young Medlicott glanced upstairs from his post on the threshold. Irefrained from watching him too keenly, but I knew what was in his mind."I'll go," he said hurriedly.  "I'll go as I am, before my mother isdisturbed and frightened out of her life.  I owe you something, too,not only for what you've done for me, but for what I was fool enough tothink about you at the first blush.  It's entirely through you that Ifeel as fit as I do for the moment.  So I'll take your tip, and go justas I am, before my poor old pipes strike up another tune."I scarcely looked up until the good fellow had turned his back upon thefinal tableau of watchful officer and prostrate prisoner and gone outwheezing into the night.  But I was at the door to hear the last of himdown the path and round the corner of the house. And when I rushed backinto the room, there was Raffles sitting cross-legged on the floor, andslowly shaking his broken head as he stanched the blood."Et tu, Bunny!" he groaned.  "Mine own familiar friend!""Then you weren't even stunned!" I exclaimed.  "Thank God for that!""Of course I was stunned," he murmured, "and no thanks to you that Iwasn't brained.  Not to know me in the kit you've seen scores of times!You never looked at me, Bunny; you didn't give me time to open mymouth.  I was going to let you run me in so prettily!  We'd have walkedoff arm-in-arm; now it's as tight a place as ever we were in, thoughyou did get rid of old blow-pipes rather nicely. But we shall have thedevil's own run for our money!"Raffles had picked himself up between his mutterings, and I hadfollowed him to the door into the garden, where he stood busy with thekey in the dark, having blown out his lantern and handed it to me.  Butthough I followed Raffles, as my nature must, I was far too embitteredto answer him again.  And so it was for some minutes that might furnishforth a thrilling page, but not a novel one to those who know theirRaffles and put up with me.  Suffice it that we left a locked doorbehind us, and the key on the garden wall, which was the first of halfa dozen that we scaled before dropping into a lane that led to afoot-bridge higher up the backwater.  And when we paused upon thefoot-bridge, the houses along the bank were still in peace and darkness.Knowing my Raffles as I did, I was not surprised when he dived underone end of this bridge, and came up with his Inverness cape and operahat, which he had hidden there on his way to the house. The thick sockswere peeled from his patent-leathers, the ragged trousers stripped froman evening pair, bloodstains and Newgate fringe removed at the water'sedge, and the whole sepulchre whited in less time than the thing takesto tell.  Nor was that enough for Raffles, but he must alter me aswell, by wearing my overcoat under his cape, and putting his Zingariscarf about my neck."And now," said he, "you may be glad to hear there's a 3:12 fromSurbiton, which we could catch on all fours.  If you like we'll goseparately, but I don't think there's the slightest danger now, and I begin to wonder what's happening to old blow-pipes."So, indeed, did I, and with no small concern, until I read of hisadventures (and our own) in the newspapers.  It seemed that he had madea gallant spurt into the road, and there paid the penalty of hisrashness by a sudden incapacity to move another inch.  It hadeventually taken him twenty minutes to creep back to locked doors, andanother ten to ring up the inmates.  His description of my personalappearance, as reported in the papers, is the only thing thatreconciles me to the thought of his sufferings during that half-hour.But at the time I had other thoughts, and they lay too deep for idlewords, for to me also it was a bitter hour.  I had not only failed inmy self-sought task; I had nearly killed my comrade into the bargain.I had meant well by friend and foe in turn, and I had ended in doingexecrably by both.  It was not all my fault, but I knew how much myweakness had contributed to the sum.  And I must walk with the manwhose fault it was, who had travelled two hundred miles to obtain thislast proof of my weakness, to bring it home to me, and to make ourintimacy intolerable from that hour.  I must walk with him to Surbiton,but I need not talk; all through Thames Ditton I had ignored hissallies; nor yet when he ran his arm through mine, on the river front,when we were nearly there, would I break the seal my pride had set uponmy lips."Come, Bunny," he said at last, "I have been the one to suffer most,when all's said and done, and I'll be the first to say that I deservedit.  You've broken my head; my hair's all glued up in my gore; and whatyarn I'm to put up at Manchester, or how I shall take the field at all,I really don't know.  Yet I don't blame you, Bunny, and I do blamemyself.  Isn't it rather hard luck if I am to go unforgiven into thebargain?  I admit that I made a mistake; but, my dear fellow, I made itentirely for your sake.""For my sake!" I echoed bitterly.Raffles was more generous; he ignored my tone."I was miserable about you--frankly--miserable!" he went on.  "Icouldn't get it out of my head that somehow you would be laid by theheels.  It was not your pluck that I distrusted, my dear fellow, but itwas your very pluck that made me tremble for you.  I couldn't get youout of my head.  I went in when runs were wanted, but I give you myword that I was more anxious about you; and no doubt that's why Ihelped to put on some runs.  Didn't you see it in the paper, Bunny?It's the innings of my life, so far.""Yes," I said, "I saw that you were in at close of play.  But I don'tbelieve it was you--I believe you have a double who plays your cricketfor you!"And at the moment that seemed less incredible than the fact."I'm afraid you didn't read your paper very carefully," said Raffles,with the first trace of pique in his tone.  "It was rain that closedplay before five o'clock.  I hear it was a sultry day in town, but atManchester we got the storm, and the ground was under water in tenminutes.  I never saw such a thing in my life.  There was absolutelynot the ghost of a chance of another ball being bowled. But I hadchanged before I thought of doing what I did.  It was only when I wason my way back to the hotel, by myself, because I couldn't talk to asoul for thinking of you, that on the spur of the moment I made the mantake me to the station instead, and was under way in the restaurant carbefore I had time to think twice about it.  I am not sure that of allthe mad deeds I have ever done, this was not the maddest of the lot!""It was the finest," I said in a low voice; for now I marvelled more atthe impulse which had prompted his feat, and at the circumstancessurrounding it, than even at the feat itself."Heaven knows," he went on, "what they are saying and doing inManchester!  But what can they say?  'What business is it of theirs?  Iwas there when play stopped, and I shall be there when it starts again.We shall be at Waterloo just after half-past three, and that's going togive me an hour at the Albany on my way to Euston, and another hour atOld Trafford before play begins. What's the matter with that?  I don'tsuppose I shall notch any more, but all the better if I don't; if wehave a hot sun after the storm, the sooner they get in the better; andmay I have a bowl at them while the ground bites!""I'll come up with you," I said, "and see you at it.""My dear fellow," replied Raffles, "that was my whole feeling aboutyou.  I wanted to 'see you at it'--that was absolutely all.  I wantedto be near enough to lend a hand if you got tied up, as the best of uswill at times.  I knew the ground better than you, and I simplycouldn't keep away from it.  But I didn't mean you to know that I wasthere; if everything had gone as I hoped it might, I should havesneaked back to town without ever letting you know I had been up.  Youshould never have dreamt that I had been at your elbow; you would havebelieved in yourself, and in my belief in you, and the rest would havebeen silence till the grave.  So I dodged you at Waterloo, and I triednot to let you know that I was following you from Esher station.  Butyou suspected somebody was; you stopped to listen more than once; afterthe second time I dropped behind, but gained on you by taking the shortcut by Imber Court and over the foot-bridge where I left my coat andhat.  I was actually in the garden before you were.  I saw you smokeyour Sullivan, and I was rather proud of you for it, though you mustnever do that sort of thing again.  I heard almost every word betweenyou and the poor devil upstairs.  And up to a certain point, Bunny, Ireally thought you played the scene to perfection."The station lights were twinkling ahead of us in the fading velvet ofthe summer's night.  I let them increase and multiply before I spoke."And where," I asked, "did you think I first went wrong?""In going in-doors at all," said Raffles.  "If I had done that, Ishould have done exactly what you did from that point on.  You couldn'thelp yourself, with that poor brute in that state.  And I admired youimmensely, Bunny, if that's any comfort to you now."Comfort!  It was wine in every vein, for I knew that Raffles meant whathe said, and with his eyes I soon saw myself in braver colors. I ceasedto blush for the vacillations of the night, since he condoned them.  Icould even see that I had behaved with a measure of decency, in a trulytrying situation, now that Raffles seemed to think so.  He had changedmy whole view of his proceedings and my own, in every incident of thenight but one.  There was one thing, however, which he might forgiveme, but which I felt that I could forgive neither Raffles nor myself.And that was the contused scalp wound over which I shuddered in thetrain."And to think that I did that," I groaned, "and that you laid yourselfopen to it, and that we have neither of us got another thing to showfor our night's work!  That poor chap said it was as bad a night as hehad ever had in his life; but I call it the very worst that you and Iever had in ours."Raffles was smiling under the double lamps of the first-classcompartment that we had to ourselves."I wouldn't say that, Bunny.  We have done worse.""Do you mean to tell me that you did anything at all?""My dear Bunny," replied Raffles, "you should remember how long I hadbeen maturing felonious little plan, what a blow it was to me to haveto turn it over to you, and how far I had travelled to see that you didit and yourself as well as might be.  You know what I did see, and howwell I understood.  I tell you again that I should have done the samething myself, in your place.  But I was not in your place, Bunny.  Myhands were not tied like yours. Unfortunately, most of the jewels havegone on the honeymoon with the happy pair; but these emerald links areall right, and I don't know what the bride was doing to leave thisdiamond comb behind. Here, too, is the old silver skewer I've beenwanting for years--they make the most charming paper-knives in theworld--and this gold cigarette-case will just do for your smallerSullivans."Nor were these the only pretty things that Raffles set out in twinklingarray upon the opposite cushions.  But I do not pretend that this wasone of our heavy hauls, or deny that its chief interest still residesin the score of the Second Test Match of that Australian tour.A Trap to Catch a CracksmanI was just putting out my light when the telephone rang a furioustocsin in the next room.  I flounced out of bed more asleep than awake;in another minute I should have been past ringing up.  It was oneo'clock in the morning, and I had been dining with Swigger Morrison athis club."Hulloa!""That you, Bunny?""Yes--are you Raffles?""What's left of me!  Bunny, I want you--quick."And even over the wire his voice was faint with anxiety andapprehension."What on earth has happened?""Don't ask!  You never know--""I'll come at once.  Are you there, Raffles?""What's that?""Are you there, man?""Ye--e--es.""At the Albany?""No, no; at Maguire's.""You never said so.  And where's Maguire?""In Half-moon Street.""I know that.  Is he there now?""No--not come in yet--and I'm caught.""Caught!""In that trap he bragged about.  It serves me right.  I didn't believein it.  But I'm caught at last ... caught ... at last!""When he told us he set it every night!  Oh, Raffles, what sort of atrap is it?  What shall I do?  What shall I bring?"But his voice had grown fainter and wearier with every answer, and nowthere was no answer at all.  Again and again I asked Raffles if he wasthere; the only sound to reach me in reply was the low metallic hum ofthe live wire between his ear and mine.  And then, as I sat gazingdistractedly at my four safe walls, with the receiver still pressed tomy head, there came a single groan, followed by the dull and dreadfulcrash of a human body falling in a heap.In utter panic I rushed back into my bedroom, and flung myself into thecrumpled shirt and evening clothes that lay where I had cast them off.But I knew no more what I was doing than what to do next I afterwardfound that I had taken out a fresh tie, and tied it rather better thanusual; but I can remember thinking of nothing but Raffles in somediabolical man-trap, and of a grinning monster stealing in to strikehim senseless with one murderous blow.  I must have looked in the glassto array myself as I did; but the mind's eye was the seeing eye, and itwas filled with this frightful vision of the notorious pugilist knownto fame and infamy as Barney Maguire.It was only the week before that Raffles and I had been introduced tohim at the Imperial Boxing Club.  Heavy-weight champion of the UnitedStates, the fellow was still drunk with his sanguinary triumphs on thatside, and clamoring for fresh conquests on ours. But his reputation hadcrossed the Atlantic before Maguire himself; the grandiose hotels hadclosed their doors to him; and he had already taken and sumptuouslyfurnished the house in Half-moon Street which does not re-let to thisday.  Raffles had made friends with the magnificent brute, while I tooktimid stock of his diamond studs, his jewelled watch-chain, hiseighteen-carat bangle, and his six-inch lower jaw.  I had shuddered tosee Raffles admiring the gewgaws in his turn, in his own brazenfashion, with that air of the cool connoisseur which had its doublemeaning for me.  I for my part would as lief have looked a tiger in theteeth.  And when we finally went home with Maguire to see his othertrophies, it seemed to me like entering the tiger's lair.  But anastounding lair it proved, fitted throughout by one eminent firm, andringing to the rafters with the last word on fantastic furniture.The trophies were a still greater surprise.  They opened my eyes to therosier aspect of the noble art, as presently practised on the rightside of the Atlantic.  Among other offerings, we were permitted tohandle the jewelled belt presented to the pugilist by the State ofNevada, a gold brick from the citizens of Sacramento, and a model ofhimself in solid silver from the Fisticuff Club in New York.  I stillremember waiting with bated breath for Raffles to ask Maguire if hewere not afraid of burglars, and Maguire replying that he had a trap tocatch the cleverest cracksman alive, but flatly refusing to tell uswhat it was.  I could not at the moment conceive a more terrible trapthan the heavy-weight himself behind a curtain.  Yet it was easy to seethat Raffles had accepted the braggart's boast as a challenge.  Nor didhe deny it later when I taxed him with his mad resolve; he merelyrefused to allow me to implicate myself in its execution.  Well, therewas a spice of savage satisfaction in the thought that Raffles had beenobliged to turn to me in the end.  And, but for the dreadful thud whichI had heard over the telephone, I might have extracted some genuinecomfort from the unerring sagacity with which he had chosen his night.Within the last twenty-four hours Barney Maguire had fought his firstgreat battle on British soil.  Obviously, he would no longer be the manthat he had been in the strict training before the fight; never, as Igathered, was such a ruffian more off his guard, or less capable ofprotecting himself and his possessions, than in these first hours ofrelaxation and inevitable debauchery for which Raffles had waited withcharacteristic foresight.  Nor was the terrible Barney likely to bemore abstemious for signal punishment sustained in a far from bloodlessvictory.  Then what could be the meaning of that sickening and mostsuggestive thud?  Could it be the champion himself who had received thecoup de grace in his cups? Raffles was the very man to administerit--but he had not talked like that man through the telephone.And yet--and yet--what else could have happened?  I must have askedmyself the question between each and all of the above reflections, madepartly as I dressed and partly in the hansom on the way to Half-moonStreet.  It was as yet the only question in my mind.  You must knowwhat your emergency is before you can decide how to cope with it; andto this day I sometimes tremble to think of the rashly direct method bywhich I set about obtaining the requisite information.  I drove everyyard of the way to the pugilist's very door.  You will remember that Ihad been dining with Swigger Morrison at his club.Yet at the last I had a rough idea of what I meant to say when the doorwas opened.  It seemed almost probable that the tragic end of our talkover the telephone had been caused by the sudden arrival and as suddenviolence of Barney Maguire.  In that case I was resolved to tell himthat Raffles and I had made a bet about his burglar trap, and that Ihad come to see who had won.  I might or might not confess that Raffleshad rung me out of bed to this end. If, however, I was wrong aboutMaguire, and he had not come home at all, then my action would dependupon the menial who answered my reckless ring.  But it should result inthe rescue of Raffles by hook or crook.I had the more time to come to some decision, since I rang and rang invain.  The hall, indeed, was in darkness; but when I peeped through theletter-box I could see a faint beam of light from the back room.  Thatwas the room in which Maguire kept his trophies and set his trap.  Allwas quiet in the house: could they have haled the intruder to VineStreet in the short twenty minutes which it had taken me to dress andto drive to the spot?  That was an awful thought; but even as I hopedagainst hope, and rang once more, speculation and suspense were cutshort in the last fashion to be foreseen.A brougham was coming sedately down the street from Piccadilly; to myhorror, it stopped behind me as I peered once more through theletter-box, and out tumbled the dishevelled prizefighter and twocompanions.  I was nicely caught in my turn.  There was a lamp-postright opposite the door, and I can still see the three of themregarding me in its light.  The pugilist had been at least a finefigure of a bully and a braggart when I saw him before his fight; nowhe had a black eye and a bloated lip, hat on the back of his head, andmade-up tie under one ear.  His companions were his sallow littleYankee secretary, whose name I really forget, but whom I met withMaguire at the Boxing Club, and a very grand person in a second skin ofshimmering sequins.I can neither forget nor report the terms in which Barney Maguire askedme who I was and what I was doing there.  Thanks, however, to SwiggerMorrison's hospitality, I readily reminded him of our former meeting,and of more that I only recalled as the words were in my mouth."You'll remember Raffles," said I, "if you don't remember me.  Youshowed us your trophies the other night, and asked us both to look youup at any hour of the day or night after the fight."I was going on to add that I had expected to find Raffles there beforeme, to settle a wager that we had made about the man-trap. But theindiscretion was interrupted by Maguire himself, whose dreadful fistbecame a hand that gripped mine with brute fervor, while with the otherhe clouted me on the back."You don't say!" he cried.  "I took you for some darned crook, but nowI remember you perfectly.  If you hadn't've spoke up slick I'd havebu'st your face in, sonny.  I would, sure!  Come right in, and have adrink to show there's--Jeehoshaphat!"The secretary had turned the latch-key in the door, only to be hauledback by the collar as the door stood open, and the light from the innerroom was seen streaming upon the banisters at the foot of the narrowstairs."A light in my den," said Maguire in a mighty whisper, "and the blameddoor open, though the key's in my pocket and we left it locked!  Talkabout crooks, eh?  Holy smoke, how I hope we've landed one alive!  Youladies and gentlemen, lay round where you are, while I see."And the hulking figure advanced on tiptoe, like a performing elephant,until just at the open door, when for a second we saw his leftrevolving like a piston and his head thrown back at its fighting angle.But in another second his fists were hands again, and Maguire wasrubbing them together as he stood shaking with laughter in the light ofthe open door."Walk up!" he cried, as he beckoned to us three.  "Walk up and see oneo' their blamed British crooks laid as low as the blamed carpet, andnailed as tight!"Imagine my feelings on the mat!  The sallow secretary went first; thesequins glittered at his heels, and I must own that for one base momentI was on the brink of bolting through the street door.  It had neverbeen shut behind us.  I shut it myself in the end.  Yet it was smallcredit to me that I actually remained on the same side of the door asRaffles."Reel home-grown, low-down, unwashed Whitechapel!"  I had heard Maguireremark within.  "Blamed if our Bowery boys ain't cock-angels to scumlike this.  Ah, you biter, I wouldn't soil my knuckles on your uglyface; but if I had my thick boots on I'd dance the soul out of yourcarcass for two cents!"After this it required less courage to join the others in the innerroom; and for some moments even I failed to identify the trulyrepulsive object about which I found them grouped.  There was no falsehair upon the face, but it was as black as any sweep's.  The clothes,on the other hand, were new to me, though older and more pestiferous inthemselves than most worn by Raffles for professional purposes.  And atfirst, as I say, I was far from sure whether it was Raffles at all; butI remembered the crash that cut short our talk over the telephone; andthis inanimate heap of rags was lying directly underneath a wallinstrument, with the receiver dangling over him."Think you know him?" asked the sallow secretary, as I stooped andpeered with my heart in my boots."Good Lord, no!  I only wanted to see if he was dead," I explained,having satisfied myself that it was really Raffles, and that Raffleswas really insensible.  "But what on earth has happened?"  I asked inmy turn."That's what I want to know," whined the person in sequins, who hadcontributed various ejaculations unworthy of report, and finallysubsided behind an ostentatious fan."I should judge," observed the secretary, "that it's for Mr. Maguire tosay, or not to say, just as he darn pleases."But the celebrated Barney stood upon a Persian hearth-rug, beaming uponus all in a triumph too delicious for immediate translation into words.The room was furnished as a study, and most artistically furnished, ifyou consider outlandish shapes in fumed oak artistic. There was nothingof the traditional prize-fighter about Barney Maguire, except hisvocabulary and his lower jaw.  I had seen over his house already, andit was fitted and decorated throughout by a high-art firm whichexhibits just such a room as that which was the scene of ourtragedietta.  The person in the sequins lay glistening like a landedsalmon in a quaint chair of enormous nails and tapestry compact.  Thesecretary leaned against an escritoire with huge hinges of beatenmetal.  The pugilist's own background presented an elaborate scheme ofoak and tiles, with inglenooks green from the joiner, and a chinacupboard with leaded panes behind his bullet head.  And his bloodshoteyes rolled with rich delight from the decanter and glasses on theoctagonal table to another decanter in the quaintest and craftiest ofrevolving spirit tables."Isn't it bully?" asked the prize-fighter, smiling on us each in turn,with his black and bloodshot eyes and his bloated lip.  "To think thatI've only to invent a trap to catch a crook, for a blamed crook to walkright into!  You, Mr. Man," and he nodded his great head at me, "you'llrecollect me telling you that I'd gotten one when you come in thatnight with the other sport?  Say, pity he's not with you now; he was agood boy, and I liked him a lot; but he wanted to know too much, and Iguess he'd got to want.  But I'm liable to tell you now, or else bu'st.See that decanter on the table?""I was just looking at it," said the person in sequins.  "You don'tknow what a turn I've had, or you'd offer me a little something.""You shall have a little something in a minute," rejoined Maguire. "Butif you take a little anything out of that decanter, you'll collapselike our friend upon the floor.""Good heavens!" I cried out, with involuntary indignation, and his fellscheme broke upon me in a clap."Yes, sir!" said Maguire, fixing me with his bloodshot orbs.  "My trapfor crooks and cracksmen is a bottle of hocussed whiskey, and I guessthat's it on the table, with the silver label around its neck. Now lookat this other decanter, without any label at all; but for that they'rethe dead spit of each other.  I'll put them side by side, so you cansee.  It isn't only the decanters, but the liquor looks the same inboth, and tastes so you wouldn't know the difference till you woke upin your tracks.  I got the poison from a blamed Indian away west, andit's ruther ticklish stuff.  So I keep the label around thetrap-bottle, and only leave it out nights. That's the idea, and that'sall there is to it," added Maguire, putting the labelled decanter backin the stand.  "But I figure it's enough for ninety-nine crooks out ofa hundred, and nineteen out of twenty 'll have their liquor before theygo to work.""I wouldn't figure on that," observed the secretary, with a downwardglance as though at the prostrate Raffles.  "Have you looked to see ifthe trophies are all safe?""Not yet," said Maguire, with a glance at the pseudo-antique cabinet inwhich he kept them.  "Then you can save yourself the trouble," rejoinedthe secretary, as he dived under the octagonal table, and came up witha small black bag that I knew at a glance.  It was the one that Raffleshad used for heavy plunder ever since I had known him.The bag was so heavy now that the secretary used both hands to get iton the table.  In another moment he had taken out the jewelled beltpresented to Maguire by the State of Nevada, the solid silver statuetteof himself, and the gold brick from the citizens of Sacramento.Either the sight of his treasures, so nearly lost, or the feeling thatthe thief had dared to tamper with them after all, suddenly infuriatedMaguire to such an extent that he had bestowed a couple of brutal kicksupon the senseless form of Raffles before the secretary and I couldinterfere."Play light, Mr. Maguire!" cried the sallow secretary.  "The man'sdrugged, as well as down.""He'll be lucky if he ever gets up, blight and blister him!""I should judge it about time to telephone for the police.""Not till I've done with him.  Wait till he comes to!  I guess I'llpunch his face into a jam pudding!  He shall wash down his teeth withhis blood before the coppers come in for what's left!""You make me feel quite ill," complained the grand lady in the chair."I wish you'd give me a little something, and not be more vulgar thanyou can 'elp.""Help yourself," said Maguire, ungallantly, "and don't talk throughyour hat.  Say, what's the matter with the 'phone?"The secretary had picked up the dangling receiver."It looks to me," said he, "as though the crook had rung up somebodybefore he went off."I turned and assisted the grand lady to the refreshment that she craved."Like his cheek!" Maguire thundered.  "But who in blazes should he ringup?""It'll all come out," said the secretary.  "They'll tell us at thecentral, and we shall find out fast enough.""It don't matter now," said Maguire.  "Let's have a drink and thenrouse the devil up."But now I was shaking in my shoes.  I saw quite clearly what thismeant.  Even if I rescued Raffles for the time being, the police wouldpromptly ascertain that it was I who had been rung up by the burglar,and the fact of my not having said a word about it would be directlydamning to me, if in the end it did not incriminate us both.  It mademe quite faint to feel that we might escape the Scylla of our presentperil and yet split on the Charybdis of circumstantial evidence.  Yet Icould see no middle course of conceivable safety, if I held my tongueanother moment.  So I spoke up desperately, with the rash resolutionwhich was the novel feature of my whole conduct on this occasion.  Butany sheep would be resolute and rash after dining with Swigger Morrisonat his club."I wonder if he rang me up?" I exclaimed, as if inspired."You, sonny?" echoed Maguire, decanter in hand.  "What in hell could heknow about you?""Or what could you know about him?" amended the secretary, fixing mewith eyes like drills."Nothing," I admitted, regretting my temerity with all my heart. "Butsome one did ring me up about an hour ago.  I thought it was Raffles.I told you I expected to find him here, if you remember.""But I don't see what that's got to do with the crook," pursued thesecretary, with his relentless eyes boring deeper and deeper into mine."No more do I," was my miserable reply.  But there was a certaincomfort in his words, and some simultaneous promise in the quantity ofspirit which Maguire splashed into his glass."Were you cut off sudden?" asked the secretary, reaching for thedecanter, as the three of us sat round the octagonal table."So suddenly," I replied, "that I never knew who it was who rang me up.No, thank you--not any for me.""What!" cried Maguire, raising a depressed head suddenly.  "You won'thave a drink in my house?  Take care, young man.  That's not being agood boy!""But I've been dining out," I expostulated, "and had my whack.  Ireally have."Barney Maguire smote the table with terrific"Say, sonny, I like you a lot," said he.  "But I shan't like you any ifyou're not a good boy!""Very well, very well," I said hurriedly.  "One finger, if I must."And the secretary helped me to not more than two."Why should it have been your friend Raffles?" he inquired, returningremorselessly to the charge, while Maguire roared "Drink up!" and thendrooped once more."I was half asleep," I answered, "and he was the first person whooccurred to me.  We are both on the telephone, you see.  And we hadmade a bet--"The glass was at my lips, but I was able to set it down untouched.Maguire's huge jaw had dropped upon his spreading shirt-front, andbeyond him I saw the person in sequins fast asleep in the artisticarmchair."What bet?" asked a voice with a sudden start in it.  The secretary wasblinking as he drained his glass."About the very thing we've just had explained to us," said I, watchingmy man intently as I spoke.  "I made sure it was a man-trap. Rafflesthought it must be something else.  We had a tremendous argument aboutit.  Raffles said it wasn't a man-trap.  I said it was.  We had a betabout it in the end.  I put my money on the man-trap.  Raffles put hisupon the other thing.  And Raffles was right--it wasn't a man-trap.But it's every bit as good--every little bit--and the whole boiling ofyou are caught in it except me!"I sank my voice with the last sentence, but I might just as well haveraised it instead.  I had said the same thing over and over again tosee whether the wilful tautology would cause the secretary to open hiseyes.  It seemed to have had the very opposite effect. His head fellforward on the table, with never a quiver at the blow, never a twitchwhen I pillowed it upon one of his own sprawling arms.  And there satMaguire bolt upright, but for the jowl upon his shirt-front, while thesequins twinkled in a regular rise and fall upon the reclining form ofthe lady in the fanciful chair.  All three were sound asleep, by whataccident or by whose design I did not pause to inquire; it was enoughto ascertain the fact beyond all chance of error.I turned my attention to Raffles last of all.  There was the other sideof the medal.  Raffles was still sleeping as sound as the enemy--or soI feared at first I shook him gently: he made no sign.  I introducedvigor into the process: he muttered incoherently. I caught and twistedan unresisting wrist--and at that he yelped profanely.  But it was manyand many an anxious moment before his blinking eyes knew mine."Bunny!" he yawned, and nothing more until his position came back tohim.  "So you came to me," he went on, in a tone that thrilled me withits affectionate appreciation, "as I knew you would!  Have they turnedup yet?  They will any minute, you know; there's not one to lose.""No, they won't, old man!" I whispered.  And he sat up and saw thecomatose trio for himself.Raffles seemed less amazed at the result than I had been as a puzzledwitness of the process; on the other hand, I had never seen anythingquite so exultant as the smile that broke through his blackenedcountenance like a light.  It was all obviously no great surprise, andno puzzle at all, to Raffles."How much did they have, Bunny?" were his first whispered words."Maguire a good three fingers, and the others at least two.""Then we needn't lower our voices, and we needn't walk on our toes.Eheu!  I dreamed somebody was kicking me in the ribs, and I believe itmust have been true."He had risen with a hand to his side and a wry look on his sweep's face."You can guess which of them it was," said I.  "The beast is jolly wellserved!"And I shook my fist in the paralytic face of the most brutal bruiser ofhis time."He is safe till the forenoon, unless they bring a doctor to him," saidRaffles.  "I don't suppose we could rouse him now if we tried. How muchof the fearsome stuff do you suppose I took?  About a tablespoonful!  Iguessed what it was, and couldn't resist making sure; the minute I wassatisfied, I changed the label and the position of the two decanters,little thinking I should stay to see the fun; but in another minute Icould hardly keep my eyes open. I realized then that I was fairlypoisoned with some subtle drug. If I left the house at all in thatstate, I must leave the spoil behind, or be found drunk in the gutterwith my head on the swag itself.  In any case I should have been pickedup and run in, and that might have led to anything.""So you rang me up!""It was my last brilliant inspiration--a sort of flash in the brain-panbefore the end--and I remember very little about it.  I was more asleepthan awake at the time.""You sounded like it, Raffles, now that one has the clue.""I can't remember a word I said, or what was the end of it, Bunny.""You fell in a heap before you came to the end.""You didn't hear that through the telephone?""As though we had been in the same room: only I thought it was Maguirewho had stolen a march on you and knocked you out."I had never seen Raffles more interested and impressed; but at thispoint his smile altered, his eyes softened, and I found my hand in his."You thought that, and yet you came like a shot to do battle for mybody with Barney Maguire!  Jack-the-Giant-killer wasn't in it with you,Bunny!""It was no credit to me--it was rather the other thing," said I,remembering my rashness and my luck, and confessing both in a breath."You know old Swigger Morrison?" I added in final explanation.  "I hadbeen dining with him at his club!"Raffles shook his long old head.  And the kindly light in his eyes wasstill my infinite reward."I don't care," said he, "how deeply you had been dining: in vinoveritas, Bunny, and your pluck would always out!  I have never doubtedit, and I never shall.  In fact, I rely on nothing else to get us outof this mess."My face must have fallen, as my heart sank at these words.  I had saidto myself that we were out of the mess already--that we had merely tomake a clean escape from the house--now the easiest thing in the world.But as I looked at Raffles, and as Raffles looked at me, on thethreshold of the room where the three sleepers slept on without soundor movement, I grasped the real problem that lay before us.  It wastwofold; and the funny thing was that I had seen both horns of thedilemma for myself, before Raffles came to his senses.  But withRaffles in his right mind, I had ceased to apply my own, or to carry myshare of our common burden another inch.  It had been an unconsciouswithdrawal on my part, an instinctive tribute to my leader; but, I wassufficiently ashamed of it as we stood and faced the problem in eachother's eyes."If we simply cleared out," continued Raffles, "you would beincriminated in the first place as my accomplice, and once they had youthey would have a compass with the needle pointing straight to me.They mustn't have either of us, Bunny, or they will get us both.  Andfor my part they may as well!"I echoed a sentiment that was generosity itself in Raffles, but in mycase a mere truism."It's easy enough for me," he went on.  "I am a common house-breaker,and I escape.  They don't know me from Noah.  But they do know you; andhow do you come to let me escape?  What has happened to you, Bunny?That's the crux.  What could have happened after they all dropped off?"And for a minute Raffles frowned and smiled like a sensation novelistworking out a plot; then the light broke, and transfigured him throughhis burnt cork.  "I've got it, Bunny!" he exclaimed.  "You took some ofthe stuff yourself, though of course not nearly so much as they did."Splendid!" I cried.  "They really were pressing it upon me at the end,and I did say it must be very little.""You dozed off in your turn, but you were naturally the first to cometo yourself.  I had flown; so had the gold brick, the jewelled belt,and the silver statuette.  You tried to rouse the others.  You couldn'tsucceed; nor would you if you did try.  So what did you do? What's theonly really innocent thing you could do in the circumstances?""Go for the police," I suggested dubiously, little relishing theprospect."There's a telephone installed for the purpose," said Raffles.  "Ishould ring them up, if I were you.  Try not to look blue about it,Bunny.  They're quite the nicest fellows in the world, and what youhave to tell them is a mere microbe to the camels I've made themswallow without a grain of salt.  It's really the most convincing storyone could conceive; but unfortunately there's another point which willtake more explaining away."And even Raffles looked grave enough as I nodded."You mean that they'll find out you rang me up?""They may," said Raffles.  "I see that I managed to replace thereceiver all right.  But still--they may.""I'm afraid they will," said I, uncomfortably.  "I'm very much afraid Igave something of the kind away.  You see, you had not replaced thereceiver; it was dangling over you where you lay. This very questioncame up, and the brutes themselves seemed so quick to see itspossibilities that I thought best to take the bull by the horns and ownthat I had been rung up by somebody. To be absolutely honest, I evenwent so far as to say I thought it was Raffles!""You didn't, Bunny!""What could I say?  I was obliged to think of somebody, and I saw theywere not going to recognize you.  So I put up a yarn about a wager wehad made about this very trap of Maguire's.  You see, Raffles, I'venever properly told you how I got in, and there's no time now; but thefirst thing I had said was that I half expected to find you here beforeme.  That was in case they spotted you at once.  But it made all thatpart about the telephone fit in rather well.""I should think it did, Bunny," murmured Raffles, in a tone that addedsensibly to my reward.  "I couldn't have done better myself, and youwill forgive my saying that you have never in your life done half sowell.  Talk about that crack you gave me on the head! You have made itup to me a hundredfold by all you have done to-night.  But the botherof it is that there's still so much to do, and to hit upon, and soprecious little time for thought as well as action."I took out my watch and showed it to Raffles without a word.  It wasthree o'clock in the morning, and the latter end of March.  In littlemore than an hour there would be dim daylight in the streets. Rafflesroused himself from a reverie with sudden decision."There's only one thing for it, Bunny," said he.  "We must trust eachother and divide the labor.  You ring up the police, and leave the restto me.""You haven't hit upon any reason for the sort of burglar they think youwere, ringing up the kind of man they know I am?""Not yet, Bunny, but I shall.  It may not be wanted for a day or so,and after all it isn't for you to give the explanation.  It would behighly suspicious if you did.""So it would," I agreed."Then will you trust me to hit on something--if possible beforemorning--in any case by the time it's wanted?  I won't fail you, Bunny.You must see how I can never, never fail you after to-night!"That settled it.  I gripped his hand without another word, and remainedon guard over the three sleepers while Raffles stole upstairs.  I havesince learned that there were servants at the top of the house, and inthe basement a man, who actually heard some of our proceedings!  But hewas mercifully too accustomed to nocturnal orgies, and those of a farmore uproarious character, to appear unless summoned to the scene.  Ibelieve he heard Raffles leave.  But no secret was made of his exit: helet himself out and told me afterward that the first person heencountered in the street was the constable on the beat.  Raffleswished him good-morning, as well he might; for he had been upstairs towash his face and hands; and in the prize-fighter's great hat and furcoat he might have marched round Scotland Yard itself, in spite of hishaving the gold brick from Sacramento in one pocket, the silverstatuette of Maguire in the other, and round his waist the jewelledbelt presented to that worthy by the State of Nevada.My immediate part was a little hard after the excitement of those smallhours.  I will only say that we had agreed that it would be wisest forme to lie like a log among the rest for half an hour, before staggeringto my feet and rousing house and police; and that in that half-hourBarney Maguire crashed to the floor, without waking either himself orhis companions, though not without bringing my beating heart into thevery roof of my mouth.It was daybreak when I gave the alarm with bell and telephone.  In afew minutes we had the house congested with dishevelled domestics,irascible doctors, and arbitrary minions of the law.  If I told mystory once, I told it a dozen times, and all on an empty stomach. Butit was certainly a most plausible and consistent tale, even withoutthat confirmation which none of the other victims was as yetsufficiently recovered to supply. And in the end I was permitted toretire from the scene until required to give further information, or toidentify the prisoner whom the good police confidently expected to makebefore the day was out.I drove straight to the flat.  The porter flew to help me out of myhansom.  His face alarmed me more than any I had left in Half-moonStreet.  It alone might have spelled my ruin."Your flat's been entered in the night, sir," he cried.  "The thieveshave taken everything they could lay hands on.""Thieves in my flat!" I ejaculated aghast.  There were one or twoincriminating possessions up there, as well as at the Albany."The door's been forced with a jimmy," said the porter.  "It was themilkman who found it out.  There's a constable up there now."A constable poking about in my flat of all others!  I rushed upstairswithout waiting for the lift.  The invader was moistening his pencilbetween laborious notes in a fat pocketbook; he had penetrated nofurther than the forced door.  I dashed past him in a fever.  I kept mytrophies in a wardrobe drawer specially fitted with a Bramah lock.  Thelock was broken--the drawer void."Something valuable, sir?" inquired the intrusive constable at my heels."Yes, indeed--some old family silver," I answered.  It was quite true.But the family was not mine.And not till then did the truth flash across my mind.  Nothing else ofvalue had been taken.  But there was a meaningless litter in all therooms.  I turned to the porter, who had followed me up from the street;it was his wife who looked after the flat."Get rid of this idiot as quick as you can," I whispered.  "I'm goingstraight to Scotland Yard myself.  Let your wife tidy the place whileI'm gone, and have the lock mended before she leaves. I'm going as Iam, this minute!"And go I did, in the first hansom I could find--but not straight toScotland Yard.  I stopped the cab in Picadilly on the way.Old Raffles opened his own door to me.  I cannot remember finding himfresher, more immaculate, more delightful to behold in every way.Could I paint a picture of Raffles with something other than my pen, itwould be as I saw him that bright March morning, at his open door inthe Albany, a trim, slim figure in matutinal gray, cool and gay andbreezy as incarnate spring."What on earth did you do it for?" I asked within."It was the only solution," he answered, handing me the cigarettes. "Isaw it the moment I got outside.""I don't see it yet.""Why should a burglar call an innocent gentleman away from home?""That's what we couldn't make out.""I tell you I got it directly I had left you.  He called you away inorder to burgle you too, of course!"And Raffles stood smiling upon me in all his incomparable radiance andaudacity."But why me?" I asked.  "Why on earth should he burgle me?""My dear Bunny, we must leave something to the imagination of thepolice.  But we will assist them to a fact or two in due season. It wasthe dead of night when Maguire first took us to his house; it was atthe Imperial Boxing Club we met him; and you meet queer fish at theImperial Boxing Club.  You may remember that he telephoned to his manto prepare supper for us, and that you and he discussed telephones andtreasure as we marched through the midnight streets.  He was certainlybucking about his trophies, and for the sake of the argument you willbe good enough to admit that you probably bucked about yours.  Whathappens?  You are overheard; you are followed; you are worked into thesame scheme, and robbed on the same night.""And you really think this will meet the case?""I am quite certain of it, Bunny, so far as it rests wit us to meet thecase at all.""Then give me another cigarette, my dear fellow, and let me push on toScotland Yard."Raffles held up both hands in admiring horror.  "Scotland Yard!""To give a false description of what you took from that drawer in mywardrobe.""A false description!  Bunny, you have no more to learn from me. Timewas when I wouldn't have let you go there without me to retrieve a lostumbrella--let alone a lost cause!"And for once I was not sorry for Raffles to have the last unworthyword, as he stood once more at his outer door and gayly waved me downthe stairs.The Spoils of SacrilegeThere was one deed of those days which deserved a place in our originalannals.  It is the deed of which I am personally most ashamed.  I havetraced the course of a score of felonies, from their source in thebrain of Raffles to their issue in his hands. I have omitted allmention of the one which emanated from my own miserable mind.  But inthese supplementary memoirs, wherein I pledged myself to extenuatenothing more that I might have to tell of Raffles, it is only fair thatI should make as clean a breast of my own baseness.  It was I, then,and I alone, who outraged natural sentiment, and trampled the expiringembers of elementary decency, by proposing and planning the raid uponmy own old home.I would not accuse myself the more vehemently by making excuses at thispoint.   Yet I feel bound to state that it was already many years sincethe place had passed from our possession into that of an utter alien,against whom I harbored a prejudice which was some excuse in itself.He had enlarged and altered the dear old place out of knowledge;nothing had been good enough for him as it stood in our day.  The manwas a hunting maniac, and where my dear father used to grow prizepeaches under glass, this vandal was soon stabling his hothousethoroughbreds, which took prizes in their turn at all the countryshows.  It was a southern county, and I never went down there withoutmissing another greenhouse and noting a corresponding extension to thestables.  Not that I ever set foot in the grounds from the day we left;but for some years I used to visit old friends in the neighborhood, andcould never resist the temptation to reconnoiter the scenes of mychildhood.  And so far as could be seen from the road--which it stoodtoo near--the house itself appeared to be the one thing that the horseypurchaser had left much as he found it.My only other excuse may be none at all in any eyes but mine.  It wasmy passionate desire at this period to "keep up my end" with Raffles inevery department of the game felonious.  He would insist upon an equaldivision of all proceeds; it was for me to earn my share.  So far I hadbeen useful only at a pinch; the whole credit of any real successbelonged invariably to Raffles.  It had always been his idea.  That wasthe tradition which I sought to end, and no means could compare withthat of my unscrupulous choice.  There was the one house in England ofwhich I knew every inch, and Raffles only what I told him.  For once Imust lead, and Raffles follow, whether he liked it or not.  He saw thathimself; and I think he liked it better than he liked me for thedesecration in view; but I had hardened my heart, and his feelings weretoo fine for actual remonstrance on such a point.I, in my obduracy, went to foul extremes.  I drew plans of all thefloors from memory.  I actually descended upon my friends in theneighborhood, with the sole object of obtaining snap-shots over our ownold garden wall.  Even Raffles could not keep his eyebrows down when Ishowed him the prints one morning in the Albany.  But he confined hisopen criticisms to the house."Built in the late 'sixties, I see," said Raffles, "or else very earlyin the 'seventies.""Exactly when it was built," I replied.  "But that's worthy of asixpenny detective, Raffles!  How on earth did you know?""That slate tower bang over the porch, with the dormer windows and theiron railing and flagstaff atop makes us a present of the period. Yousee them on almost every house of a certain size built about thirtyyears ago.  They are quite the most useless excrescences I know.""Ours wasn't," I answered, with some warmth.  "It was my sanctumsanctorum in the holidays.  I smoked my first pipe up there, and wrotemy first verses."Raffles laid a kindly hand upon my shoulder--"Bunny, Bunny, you can robthe old place, and yet you can't hear a word against it?""That's different," said I relentlessly.  "The tower was there in mytime, but the man I mean to rob was not.""You really do mean to do it, Bunny?""By myself, if necessary?  I averred."Not again, Bunny, not again," rejoined Raffles, laughing as he shookhis head.  "But do you think the man has enough to make it worth ourwhile to go so far afield?""Far afield!  It's not forty miles on the London and Brighton.""Well, that's as bad as a hundred on most lines.  And when did you sayit was to be?""Friday week.""I don't much like a Friday, Bunny.  Why make it one?""It's the night of their Hunt Point-to-Point.  They wind up the seasonwith it every year; and the bloated Guillemard usually sweeps the boardwith his fancy flyers.""You mean the man in your old house?""Yes; and he tops up with no end of dinner there," I went on, "to hishunting pals and the bloods who ride for him.  If the festive boarddoesn't groan under a new regiment of challenge cups, it will be nofault of theirs, and old Guillemard will have to do them top-hole allthe same.""So it's a case of common pot-hunting," remarked Raffles, eyeing meshrewdly through the cigarette smoke."Not for us, my dear fellow," I made answer in his own tone.  "Iwouldn't ask you to break into the next set of chambers here in theAlbany for a few pieces of modern silver, Raffles.  Not that we needscorn the cups if we get a chance of lifting them, and if Guillemarddoes so in the first instance.  It's by no means certain that he will.But it is pretty certain to be a lively night for him and his pals--anda vulnerable one for the best bedroom!""Capital!" said Raffles, throwing coils of smoke between his smiles."Still, if it's a dinner-party, the hostess won't leave her jewelsupstairs.  She'll wear them, my boy.""Not all of them, Raffles; she has far too many for that.  Besides, itisn't an ordinary dinner-party; they say Mrs.  Guillemard is generallythe only lady there, and that she's quite charming in herself.  Now, nocharming woman would clap on all sail in jewels for a roomful offox-hunters.""It depends what jewels she has.""Well, she might wear her rope of pearls.""I should have said so.""And, of course, her rings.""Exactly, Bunny.""But not necessarily her diamond tiara--""Has she got one?""--and certainly not her emerald and diamond necklace on top of all!"Raffles snatched the Sullivan from his lips, and his eyes burned likeits end."Bunny, do you mean to tell me there are all these things?""Of course I do," said I.  "They are rich people, and he's not such abrute as to spend everything on his stable.  Her jewels are as much thetalk as his hunters.  My friends told me all about both the other daywhen I was down making inquiries.  They thought my curiosity as naturalas my wish for a few snapshots of the old place.  In their opinion theemerald necklace alone must be worth thousands of pounds."Raffles rubbed his hands in playful pantomime."I only hope you didn't ask too many questions, Bunny!  But if yourfriends are such old friends, you will never enter their heads whenthey hear what has happened, unless you are seen down there on thenight, which might be fatal.  Your approach will require some thought:if you like I can work out the shot for you.  I shall go downindependently, and the best thing may be to meet outside the houseitself on the night of nights.  But from that moment I am in yourhands."And on these refreshing lines our plan of campaign was graduallydeveloped and elaborated into that finished study on which Raffleswould rely like any artist of the footlights.  None were more capablethan he of coping with the occasion as it rose, of rising himself withthe emergency of the moment, of snatching a victory from the very dustof defeat.  Yet, for choice, every detail was premeditated, and analternative expedient at each finger's end for as many bare and awfulpossibilities.  In this case, however, the finished study stopped shortat the garden gate or wall; there I was to assume command; and thoughRaffles carried the actual tools of trade of which he alone was master,it was on the understanding that for once I should control and directtheir use.I had gone down in evening-clothes by an evening train, but hadcarefully overshot old landmarks, and alighted at a small station somemiles south of the one where I was still remembered.  This committed meto a solitary and somewhat lengthy tramp; but the night was mild andstarry, and I marched into it with a high stomach; for this was to beno costume crime, and yet I should have Raffles at my elbow all thenight.  Long before I reached my destination, indeed, he stood in waitfor me on the white highway, and we finished with linked arms."I came down early," said Raffles, "and had a look at the races.  Ialways prefer to measure my man, Bunny; and you needn't sit in thefront row of the stalls to take stock of your friend Guillemard. Nowonder he doesn't ride his own horses!  The steeple-chaser isn't foaledthat would carry him round that course.  But he's a fine monument of aman, and he takes his troubles in a way that makes me blush to add tothem.""Did he lose a horse?" I inquired cheerfully."No, Bunny, but he didn't win a race!  His horses were by chalks thebest there, and his pals rode them like the foul fiend, but with theworst of luck every time.  Not that you'd think it, from the rowthey're making.  I've been listening to them from the road--you alwaysdid say the house stood too near it.""Then you didn't go in?""When it's your show?  You should know me better.  Not a foot would Iset on the premises behind your back.  But here they are, so perhapsyou'll lead the way."And I led it without a moment's hesitation, through the unpretentioussix-barred gate into the long but shallow crescent of the drive. Therewere two such gates, one at each end of the drive, but no lodge ateither, and not a light nearer than those of the house.  The shape andaltitude of the lighted windows, the whisper of the laurels on eitherhand, the very feel of the gravel underfoot, were at once familiar tomy senses as the sweet, relaxing, immemorial air that one drank deeperat every breath.  Our stealthy advance was to me like stealing backinto one's childhood; and yet I could conduct it without compunction.I was too excited to feel immediate remorse, albeit not too lost inexcitement to know that remorse for every step that I was taking wouldbe my portion soon enough.  I mean every word that I have written of mypeculiar shame for this night's work.  And it was all to come over mebefore the night was out.  But in the garden I never felt it once.The dining-room windows blazed in the side of the house facing theroad.  That was an objection to peeping through the venetian blinds, aswe nevertheless did, at our peril of observation from the road. Raffleswould never have led me into danger so gratuitous and unnecessary, buthe followed me into it without a word.  I can only plead that we bothhad our reward.  There was a sufficient chink in the obsoletevenetians, and through it we saw every inch of the picturesque board.Mrs. Guillemard was still in her place, but she really was the onlylady, and dressed as quietly as I had prophesied; round her neck washer rope of pearls, but not the glimmer of an emerald nor the glint ofa diamond, nor yet the flashing constellation of a tiara in her hair.I gripped Raffles in token of my triumph, and he nodded as he scannedthe overwhelming majority of flushed fox-hunters.  With the exceptionof one stripling, evidently the son of the house, they were in eveningpink to a man; and as I say, their faces matched their coats.  Anenormous fellow, with a great red face and cropped moustache, occupiedmy poor father's place; he it was who had replaced our fruitfulvineries with his stinking stables; but I am bound to own he looked agenial clod, as he sat in his fat and listened to the young bloodsboasting of their prowess, or elaborately explaining their mishaps.And for a minute we listened also, before I remembered myresponsibilities, and led Raffles round to the back of the house.There never was an easier house to enter.  I used to feel that keenlyas a boy, when, by a prophetic irony, burglars were my bugbear, and Ilooked under my bed every night in life.  The bow-windows on the groundfloor finished in inane balconies to the first-floor windows.  Thesebalconies had ornamental iron railings, to which a less ingeniousrope-ladder than ours could have been hitched with equal ease.  Raffleshad brought it with him, round his waist, and he carried the telescopicstick for fixing it in place.  The one was unwound, and the other puttogether, in a secluded corner of the red-brick walls, where of old Ihad played my own game of squash-rackets in the holidays.  I madefurther investigations in the starlight, and even found a trace of myoriginal white line along the red wall.But it was not until we had effected our entry through the room whichhad been my very own, and made our parlous way across the lightedlanding, to the best bedroom of those days and these, that I reallyfelt myself a worm.  Twin brass bedsteads occupied the site of the oldfour-poster from which I had first beheld the light.  The doors werethe same; my childish hands had grasped these very handles.  And therewas Raffles securing the landing door with wedge and gimlet, the verysecond after softly closing it behind us."The other leads into the dressing-room, of course?  Then you might befixing the outer dressing-room door," he whispered at his work, "butnot the middle one Bunny, unless you want to.  The stuff will be inthere, you see, if it isn't in here."My door was done in a moment, being fitted with a powerful bolt; butnow an aching conscience made me busier than I need have been. I hadraised the rope-ladder after us into my own old room, and while Raffleswedged his door I lowered the ladder from one of the best bedroomwindows, in order to prepare that way of escape which was a fundamentalfeature of his own strategy.  I meant to show Raffles that I had notfollowed in his train for nothing.  But I left it to him to unearth thejewels.  I had begun by turning up the gas; there appeared to be nopossible risk in that; and Raffles went to work with a will in theexcellent light.  There were some good pieces in the room, including anancient tallboy in fruity mahogany, every drawer of which was turnedout on the bed without avail.  A few of the drawers had locks to pick,yet not one triffle to our taste within.  The situation became seriousas the minutes flew.  We had left the party at its sweets; the solitarylady might be free to roam her house at any minute.  In the end weturned our attention to the dressing-room.  And no sooner did Rafflesbehold the bolted door than up went his hands."A bathroom bolt," he cried below his breath, "and no bath in the room!Why didn't you tell me, Bunny?  A bolt like that speaks volumes;there's none on the bedroom door, remember, and this one's worthy of astrong room!  What if it is their strong room, Bunny! Oh, Bunny, whatif this is their safe?"Raffles had dropped upon his knees before a carved oak chest ofindisputable antiquity.  Its panels were delightfully irregular, itsangles faultlessly faulty, its one modern defilement a strong lock tothe lid.  Raffles was smiling as he produced his jimmy. R--r--r--ripwent lock or lid in another ten seconds--I was not there to see which.I had wandered back into the bedroom in a paroxysm of excitement andsuspense.  I must keep busy as well as Raffles, and it was not toosoon to see whether the rope-ladder was all right.  In another minute...I stood frozen to the floor.  I had hooked the ladder beautifully tothe inner sill of wood, and had also let down the extended rod for themore expeditious removal of both on our return to terra firma.Conceive my cold horror on arriving at the open window just in time tosee the last of hooks and bending rod, as they floated out of sight andreach into the outer darkness of the night, removed by some silent andinvisible hand below!"Raffles-Raffles--they've spotted us and moved the ladder this veryinstant!"So I panted as I rushed on tiptoe to the dressing-room.  Raffles hadthe working end of his jimmy under the lid of a leathern jewel case. Itflew open at the vicious twist of his wrist that preceded his reply."Did you let them see that you'd spotted that?""No.""Good!  Pocket some of these cases--no time to open them.  Which door'snearest the backstairs?""The other.""Come on then?""No, no, I'll lead the way.  I know every inch of it."And, as I leaned against the bedroom door, handle in hand, whileRaffles stooped to unscrew the gimlet and withdraw the wedge, I hitupon the ideal port in the storm that was evidently about to burst onour devoted heads.  It was the last place in which they would look fora couple of expert cracksmen with no previous knowledge of the house.If only we could gain my haven unobserved, there we might lie inunsuspected hiding, and by the hour, if not for days and nights.Alas for that sanguine dream!  The wedge was out, and Raffles on hisfeet behind me.  I opened the door, and for a second the pair of usstood upon the threshold.Creeping up the stairs before us, each on the tip of his silken toes,was a serried file of pink barbarians, redder in the face than anywhereelse, and armed with crops carried by the wrong end. The monumentalperson with the short moustache led the advance.  The fool stood stillupon the top step to let out the loudest and cheeriest view-holloa thatever smote my ears.It cost him more than he may know until I tell him.  There was the widepart of the landing between us; we had just that much start along thenarrow part, with the walls and doors upon our left, the banisters onour right, and the baize door at the end.  But if the great Guillemardhad not stopped to live up to his sporting reputation, he wouldassuredly have laid one or other of us by the heels, and either wouldhave been tantamount to both.  As I gave Raffles a headlong lead to thebaize door, I glanced down the great well of stairs, and up came thedaft yells of these sporting oafs:"Gone away--gone away!""Yoick--yoick--yoick?""Yon-der they go?"And gone I had, through the baize door to the back landing, withRaffles at my heels.  I held the swing door for him, and heard him bangit in the face of the spluttering and blustering master of the house.Other feet were already in the lower flight of the backstairs; but theupper flight was the one for me, and in an instant we were racing alongthe upper corridor with the chuckle-headed pack at our heels.  Here itwas all but dark--they were the servants' bedrooms that we were passingnow--but I knew what I was doing.  Round the last corner to the right,through the first door to the left and we were in the room underneaththe tower. In our time a long stepladder had led to the tower itself.I rushed in the dark to the old corner.  Thank God, the ladder wasthere still!  It leaped under us as we rushed aloft like one quadruped.The breakneck trap-door was still protected by a curved brassstanchion; this I grasped with one hand, and then Raffles with theother as I felt my feet firm upon the tower floor.  In he sprawledafter me, and down went the trap-door with a bang upon the leadinghound.I hoped to feel his dead-weight shake the house, as he crashed upon thefloor below; but the fellow must have ducked, and no crash came.Meanwhile not a word passed between Raffles and me; he had followed me,as I had led him, without waste of breath upon a single syllable. Butthe merry lot below were still yelling and bellowing in full cry."Gone to ground?  screamed one."Where's the terrier?" screeched another.But their host of the mighty girth--a man like a soda-water bottle,from my one glimpse of him on his feet--seemed sobered rather thanstunned by the crack on that head of his.  We heard his fine voice nomore, but we could feel him straining every thew against the trap-doorupon which Raffles and I stood side by side.  At least I thoughtRaffles was standing, until he asked me to strike a light, when I foundhim on his knees instead of on his feet, busy screwing down thetrap-door with his gimlet.  He carried three or four gimlets forwedging doors, and he drove them all in to the handle, while I pulledat the stanchion and pushed with my feet.But the upward pressure ceased before our efforts.  We heard the laddercreak again under a ponderous and slow descent; and we stood upright inthe dim flicker of a candle-end that I had lit and left burning on thefloor.  Raffles glanced at the four small windows in turn and then atme.  "Is there any way out at all?" he whispered, as no other beingwould or could have whispered to the man who had led him into such atrap.  "We've no rope-ladder, you know.""Thanks to me," I groaned.  "The whole thing's my fault?"Nonsense, Bunny; there was no other way to run.  But what about thesewindows?"His magnanimity took me by the throat; without a word I led him to theone window looking inward upon sloping slates and level leads. Often asa boy I had clambered over them, for the fearful fun of risking lifeand limb, or the fascination of peering through the great squareskylight, down the well of the house into the hall below.  There were,however, several smaller skylights, for the benefit of the top floor,through any one of which I thought we might have made a dash.  But at aglance I saw we were too late: one of these skylights became abrilliant square before our eyes; opened, and admitted a flushed faceon flaming shoulders."I'll give them a fright!"  said Raffles through his teeth.  In aninstant he had plucked out his revolver, smashed the window with itsbutt, and the slates with a bullet not a yard from the protruding head.And that, I believe, was the only shot that Raffles ever fired in hiswhole career as a midnight marauder."You didn't hit him?" I gasped, as the head disappeared, and we heard acrash in the corridor."Of course I didn't, Bunny," he replied, backing into the tower; "butno one will believe I didn't mean to, and it'll stick on ten years ifwe're caught.  That's nothing, if it gives us an extra five minutesnow, while they hold a council of war.  Is that a working flag-staffoverhead?""It used to be.""Then there'll be halliards.""They were as thin as clothes-lines."."And they're sure to be rotten, and we should be seen cutting themdown.  No, Bunny, that won't do.  Wait a bit.  Is there a lightningconductor?""There was."I opened one of the side windows and reached out as far as I could."You'll be seen from that skylight!" cried Raffles in a warningundertone."No, I won't.  I can't see it myself.  But here's thelightning-conductor, where it always was.""How thick," asked Raffles, as I drew in and rejoined him."Rather thicker than a lead-pencil.""They sometimes bear you," said Raffles, slipping on a pair of whitekid gloves, and stuffing his handkerchief into the palm of one. "Thedifficulty is to keep a grip; but I've been up and down them beforeto-night.  And it's our only chance.  I'll go first, Bunny: you watchme, and do exactly as I do if I get down all right.""But if you don't?""If I don't," whispered Raffles, as he wormed through the window feetforemost, "I'm afraid you'll have to face the music where you are, andI shall have the best of it down in Acheron!"And he slid out of reach without another word, leaving me to shudderalike at his levity and his peril; nor could I follow him very far bythe wan light of the April stars; but I saw his forearms resting amoment in the spout that ran around the tower, between bricks andslates, on the level of the floor; and I had another dim glimpse of himlower still, on the eaves over the very room that we had ransacked.Thence the conductor ran straight to earth in an angle of the facade.And since it had borne him thus far without mishap, I felt that Raffleswas as good as down.  But I had neither his muscles nor his nerves, andmy head swam as I mounted to the window and prepared to creep outbackward in my turn.So it was that at the last moment I had my first unobstructed view ofthe little old tower of other days.  Raffles was out of the way; thebit of candle was still burning on the floor, and in its dim light thefamiliar haunt was cruelly like itself of innocent memory. A lesserladder still ascended to a tinier trap-door in the apex of the tower;the fixed seats looked to me to be wearing their old, old coat ofgrained varnish; nay the varnish had its ancient smell, and the veryvanes outside creaked their message to my ears.  I remembered wholedays that I had spent, whole books that I had read, here in thisfavorite fastness of my boyhood.  The dirty little place, with thedormer window in each of its four sloping sides, became a gallery hungwith poignant pictures of the past.  And here was I leaving it with mylife in my hands and my pockets full of stolen jewels!  A superstitionseized me.  Suppose the conductor came down with me ...  suppose Islipped ... and was picked up dead, with the proceeds of my shamefulcrime upon me, under the very windows  ...where the sun  Came peeping in at dawn...I hardly remember what I did or left undone.  I only know that nothingbroke, that somehow I kept my hold, and that in the end the wire ranred-hot through my palms so that both were torn and bleeding when Istood panting beside Raffles in the flower-beds. There was no time forthinking then.  Already there was a fresh commotion in-doors; the tidalwave of excitement which had swept all before it to the upper regionswas subsiding in as swift a rush downstairs; and I raced after Rafflesalong the edge of the drive without daring to look behind.We came out by the opposite gate to that by which we had stolen in.Sharp to the right ran the private lane behind the stables and sharp tothe right dashed Raffles, instead of straight along the open road.  Itwas not the course I should have chosen, but I followed Raffles withouta murmur, only too thankful that he had assumed the lead at last.Already the stables were lit up like a chandelier; there was a staccatorattle of horseshoes in the stable yard, and the great gates wereopening as we skimmed past in the nick of time.  In another minute wewere skulking in the shadow of the kitchen-garden wall while thehigh-road rang with the dying tattoo of galloping hoofs."That's for the police," said Raffles, waiting for me.  "But the fun'sonly beginning in the stables.  Hear the uproar, and see the lights!In another minute they'll be turning out the hunters for the last runof the season.""We mustn't give them one, Raffles?""Of course we mustn't; but that means stopping where we are.""We can't do that?""If they're wise they'll send a man to every railway station within tenmiles and draw every cover inside the radius.  I can only think of onethat's not likely to occur to them.""What's that?""The other side of this wall.  How big is the garden, Bunny?""Six or seven acres.""Well, you must take me to another of your old haunts, where we can lielow till morning.""And then?""Sufficient for the night, Bunny!  The first thing is to find a burrow.What are those trees at the end of this lane?""St. Leonard's Forest.""Magnificent!  They'll scour every inch of that before they come backto their own garden.  Come, Bunny, give me a leg up, and I'll pull youafter me in two ticks!"There was indeed nothing better to be done; and, much as I loathed anddreaded entering the place again, I had already thought of a secondsanctuary of old days, which might as well be put to the base uses ofthis disgraceful night.  In a far corner of the garden, over a hundredyards from the house, a little ornamental lake had been dug within myown memory; its shores were shelving lawn and steep banks ofrhododendrons; and among the rhododendrons nestled a tiny boathousewhich had been my childish joy.  It was half a dock for the dingy inwhich one plowed these miniature waters and half a bathing-box forthose who preferred their morning tub among the goldfish.  I could notthink of a safer asylum than this, if we must spend the night upon thepremises; and Raffles agreed with me when I had led him by shelteringshrubbery and perilous lawn to the diminutive chalet between therhododendrons and the water.But what a night it was!  The little bathing-box had two doors, one tothe water, the other to the path.  To hear all that could be heard, itwas necessary to keep both doors open, and quite imperative not totalk.  The damp night air of April filled the place, and crept throughour evening clothes and light overcoats into the very marrow; themental torture of the situation was renewed and multiplied in my brain;and all the time one's ears were pricked for footsteps on the pathbetween the rhododendrons. The only sounds we could at first identifycame one and all from the stables.  Yet there the excitement subsidedsooner than we had expected, and it was Raffles himself who breathed adoubt as to whether they were turning out the hunters after all.  Onthe other hand, we heard wheels in the drive not long after midnight;and Raffles, who was beginning to scout among the shrubberies, stoleback to tell me that the guests were departing, and being sped, with anunimpaired conviviality which he failed to understand. I said I couldnot understand it either, but suggested the general influence ofliquor, and expressed my envy of their state.  I had drawn my knees upto my chin, on the bench where one used to dry one's self afterbathing, and there I sat in a seeming stolidity at utter variance withmy inward temper.  I heard Raffles creep forth again and I let him gowithout a word.  I never doubted that he would be back again in aminute, and so let many minutes elapse before I realized his continuedabsence, and finally crept out myself to look for him.Even then I only supposed that he had posted himself outside in somemore commanding position.  I took a catlike stride and breathed hisname.  There was no answer.  I ventured further, till I could overlookthe lawns: they lay like clean slates in the starlight: there was nosign of living thing nearer than the house, which was still lit up, butquiet enough now.  Was it a cunning and deliberate quiet assumed as asnare?  Had they caught Raffles, and were they waiting for me?  Ireturned to the boat-house in an agony of fear and indignation.  It wasfear for the long hours that I sat there waiting for him; it wasindignation when at last I heard his stealthy step upon the gravel.  Iwould not go out to meet him.  I sat where I was while the stealthystep came nearer, nearer; and there I was sitting when the door opened,and a huge man in riding-clothes stood before me in the steely dawn.I leaped to my feet, and the huge man clapped me playfully on theshoulder."Sorry I've been so long, Bunny, but we should never have got away aswe were; this riding-suit makes a new man of me, on top of my own, andhere's a youth's kit that should do you down to the ground.""So you broke into the house again?"I was obliged to, Bunny; but I had to watch the lights out one by one,and give them a good hour after that I went through that dressing roomat my leisure this time; the only difficulty was to spot the son'squarters at the back of the house; but I overcame it, as you see, inthe end.  I only hope they'll fit, Bunny.  Give me your patentleathers, and I'll fill them with stones and sink them in the pond.I'm doing the same with mine.  Here's a brown pair apiece, and wemustn't let the grass grow under them if we're to get to the station intime for the early train while the coast's still clear."The early train leaves the station in question at 6.20 A.M.; and thatfine spring morning there was a police officer in a peaked cap to seeit off; but he was too busy peering into the compartments for a pair ofvery swell mobsmen that he took no notice of the huge man inriding-clothes, who was obviously intoxicated, or the moreinsignificant but not less horsy character who had him in hand.  Theearly train is due at Victoria at 8.28, but these worthies left it atClapham Junction, and changed cabs more than once between Battersea andPiccadilly, and a few of their garments in each four-wheeler.  It wasbarely nine o'clock when they sat together in the Albany, and mighthave been recognized once more as Raffles and myself."And now," said Raffles, "before we do anything else, let us turn outthose little cases that we hadn't time to open when we took them.  Imean the ones I handed to you, Bunny.  I had a look into mine in thegarden, and I'm sorry to say there was nothing in them. The lady musthave been wearing their proper contents."Raffles held out his hand for the substantial leather cases which I hadproduced at his request.  But that was the extent of my compliance;instead of handing them over, I looked boldly into the eyes that seemedto have discerned my wretched secret at one glance."It is no use my giving them to you," I said.  "They are empty also.""When did you look into them?""In the tower.""Well, let me see for myself.""As you like.""My dear Bunny, this one must have contained the necklace you boastedabout.""Very likely.""And this one the tiara.""I dare say.""Yet she was wearing neither, as you prophesied, and as we both saw forourselves."I had not taken my eyes from his."Raffles," I said, "I'll be frank with you after all.  I meant younever to know, but it's easier than telling you a lie.  I left boththings behind me in the tower.  I won't attempt to explain or defendmyself; it was probably the influence of the tower, and nothing else;but the whole thing came over me at the last moment, when you had goneand I was going.  I felt that I should very probably break my neck,that I cared very little whether I did or not, but that it would befrightful to break it at that house with those things in my pocket.You may say I ought to have thought of all that before! you may saywhat you like, and you won't say more than I deserve. It washysterical, and it was mean, for I kept the cases to impose on you.""You were always a bad liar, Bunny," said Raffles, smiling.  "Will youthink me one when I tell you that I can understand what you felt, andeven what you did?  As a matter of fact, I have understood for severalhours now.""You mean what I felt, Raffles?""And what you did.  I guessed it in the boathouse.  I knew thatsomething must have happened or been discovered to disperse thattruculent party of sportsmen so soon and on such good terms withthemselves.  They had not got us; they might have got something betterworth having; and your phlegmatic attitude suggested what. As luckwould have it, the cases that I personally had collared were the emptyones; the two prizes had fallen to you.  Well, to allay my horridsuspicion, I went and had another peep through the lighted venetians.And what do you think I saw?"I shook my head.  I had no idea, nor was I very eager for enlightenment."The two poor people whom it was your own idea to despoil," quothRaffles, "prematurely gloating over these two pretty things?"He withdrew a hand from either pocket of his crumpled dinner-jacket,and opened the pair under my nose.  In one was a diamond tiara, and inthe other a necklace of fine emeralds set in clusters of brilliants."You must try to forgive me, Bunny," continued Raffles before I couldspeak.  "I don't say a word against what you did, or undid; in fact,now it's all over, I am rather glad to think that you did try to undoit.  But, my dear fellow, we had both risked life, limb, and liberty;and I had not your sentimental scruples.  Why should I go empty away?If you want to know the inner history of my second visit to that goodfellow's dressing-room, drive home for a fresh kit and meet me at theTurkish bath in twenty minutes. I feel more than a little grubby, andwe can have our breakfast in the cooling gallery.  Besides, after awhole night in your old haunts, Bunny, it's only in order to wind up inNorthumberland Avenue."The Raffles RelicsIt was in one of the magazines for December, 1899, that an articleappeared which afforded our minds a brief respite from the thenconsuming excitement of the war in South Africa.  These were the dayswhen Raffles really had white hair, and when he and I were nearing theend of our surreptitious second innings, as professional cracksmen ofthe deadliest dye.  Piccadilly and the Albany knew us no more.  But westill operated, as the spirit tempted us, from our latest and mostidyllic base, on the borders of Ham Common.  Recreation was ourgreatest want; and though we had both descended to the humble bicycle,a lot of reading was forced upon us in the winter evenings.  Thus thewar came as a boon to us both.  It not only provided us with an honestinterest in life, but gave point and zest to innumerable spins acrossRichmond Park, to the nearest paper shop; and it was from such anexpedition that I returned with inflammatory matter unconnected withthe war.  The magazine was one of those that are read (and sold) by themillion; the article was rudely illustrated on every other page.  Itssubject was the so-called Black Museum at Scotland Yard; and from thecatchpenny text we first learned that the gruesome show was nowenriched by a special and elaborate exhibit known as the Raffles Relics."Bunny," said Raffles, "this is fame at last!  It is no longernotoriety; it lifts one out of the ruck of robbers into the society ofthe big brass gods, whose little delinquencies are written in water bythe finger of time.  The Napoleon Relics we know, the Nelson Relicswe've heard about, and here are mine!""Which I wish to goodness we could see," I added, longingly.  Nextmoment I was sorry I had spoken.  Raffles was looking at me across themagazine.  There was a smile on his lips that I knew too well, a lightin his eyes that I had kindled."What an excellent idea?  he exclaimed, quite softly, as though workingit out already in his brain."I didn't mean it for one," I answered, "and no more do you.""Certainly I do," said Raffles.  "I was never more serious in my life.""You would march into Scotland Yard in broad daylight?""In broad lime-light," he answered, studying the magazine again, "toset eyes on my own once more.  Why here they all are, Bunny--you nevertold me there was an illustration.  That's the chest you took to yourbank with me inside, and those must be my own rope-ladder and things ontop.  They produce so badly in the baser magazines that it's impossibleto swear to them; there's nothing for it but a visit of inspection.""Then you can pay it alone," said I grimly.  "You may have altered, butthey'd know me at a glance.""By all means, Bunny, if you'll get me the pass.""A pass?" I cried triumphantly.  "Of course we should have to get one,and of course that puts an end to the whole idea.  Who on earth wouldgive a pass for this show, of all others, to an old prisoner like me?"Raffles addressed himself to the reading of the magazine with a shrugthat showed some temper."The fellow who wrote this article got one," said he shortly.  "He gotit from his editor, and you can get one from yours if you tried. Butpray don't try, Bunny: it would be too terrible for you to risk amoment's embarrassment to gratify a mere whim of mine.  And if I wentinstead of you and got spotted, which is so likely with this head ofhair, and the general belief in my demise, the consequences to youwould be too awful to contemplate!  Don't contemplate them, my dearfellow.  And do let me read my magazine."Need I add that I set about the rash endeavor without furtherexpostulation?  I was used to such ebullitions from the altered Rafflesof these later days, and I could well understand them.  All theinconvenience of the new conditions fell on him.  I had purged my knownoffences by imprisonment, whereas Raffles was merely supposed to haveescaped punishment in death.  The result was that I could rush in whereRaffles feared to tread, and was his plenipotentiary in all honestdealings with the outer world.  It could not but gall him to be sodependent upon me, and it was for me to minimize the humiliation byscrupulously avoiding the least semblance of an abuse of that powerwhich I now had over him. Accordingly, though with much misgiving, Idid his ticklish behest in Fleet Street, where, despite my past, I wasalready making a certain lowly footing for myself.  Success followed asit will when one longs to fail; and one fine evening I returned to HamCommon with a card from the Convict Supervision Office, New ScotlandYard, which I treasure to this day.  I am surprised to see that it wasundated, and might still almost "Admit Bearer to see the Museum," tosay nothing of the bearer's friends, since my editor's name "and party"is scrawled beneath the legend."But he doesn't want to come," as I explained to Raffles.  "And itmeans that we can both go, if we both like."Raffles looked at me with a wry smile; he was in good enough humor now."It would be rather dangerous, Bunny.  If they spotted you, they mightthink of me.""But you say they'll never know you now.""I don't believe they will.  I don't believe there's the slightestrisk; but we shall soon see.  I've set my heart on seeing, Bunny, butthere's no earthly reason why I should drag you into it.""You do that when you present this card," I pointed out.  "I shall hearof it fast enough if anything happens.""Then you may as well be there to see the fun?""It will make no difference if the worst comes to the worst.""And the ticket is for a party, isn't it?""It is.""It might even look peculiar if only one person made use of it?""It might.""Then we're both going, Bunny!  And I give you my word," cried Raffles,"that no real harm shall come of it.  But you mustn't ask to see theRelics, and you mustn't take too much interest in them when you do seethem.  Leave the questioning to me: it really will be a chance offinding out whether they've any suspicion of one's resurrection atScotland Yard.  Still I think I can promise you a certain amount offun, old fellow, as some little compensation for your pangs and fears?"The early afternoon was mild and hazy, and unlike winter but for theprematurely low sun struggling through the haze, as Raffles and Iemerged from the nether regions at Westminster Bridge, and stood forone moment to admire the infirm silhouettes of Abbey and Houses in flatgray against a golden mist.  Raffles murmured of Whistler and of ArthurSevern, and threw away a good Sullivan because the smoke would curlbetween him and the picture.  It is perhaps the picture that I can nowsee clearest of all the set scenes of our lawless life.  But at thetime I was filled with gloomy speculation as to whether Raffles wouldkeep his promise of providing an entirely harmless entertainment for mybenefit at the Black Museum.We entered the forbidding precincts; we looked relentless officers inthe face, and they almost yawned in ours as they directed us throughswing doors and up stone stairs.  There was something even sinister inthe casual character of our reception.  We had an arctic landing toourselves for several minutes, which Raffles spent in an instinctivesurvey of the premises, while I cooled my heels before the portrait ofa late commissioner."Dear old gentleman!" exclaimed Raffles, joining me.  "I have met himat dinner, and discussed my own case with him, in the old days. But wecan't know too little about ourselves in the Black Museum, Bunny.  Iremember going to the old place in Whitehall, years ago, and beingshown round by one of the tip-top 'tecs.  And this may be another."But even I could see at a glance that there was nothing of thedetective and everything of the clerk about the very young man who hadjoined us at last upon the landing.  His collar was the tallest I haveever seen, and his face was as pallid as his collar.  He carried aloose key, with which he unlocked a door a little way along thepassage, and so ushered us into that dreadful repository which perhapshas fewer visitors than any other of equal interest in the world.  Theplace was cold as the inviolate vault; blinds had to be drawn up, andglass cases uncovered, before we could see a thing except the row ofmurderers' death-masks--the placid faces with the swollen necks--thatstood out on their shelves to give us ghostly greeting."This fellow isn't formidable," whispered Raffles, as the blinds wentup; "still, we can't be too careful.  My little lot are round thecorner, in the sort of recess; don't look till we come to them in theirturn."So we began at the beginning, with the glass case nearest the door; andin a moment I discovered that I knew far more about its contents thanour pallid guide.  He had some enthusiasm, but the most inaccuratesmattering of his subject.  He mixed up the first murderer with quitethe wrong murder, and capped his mistake in the next breath with anintolerable libel on the very pearl of our particular tribe."This revawlver," he began, "belonged to the celebrited burgular,Chawles Peace.  These are his spectacles, that's his jimmy, and thishere knife's the one that Chawley killed the policeman with."Now I like accuracy for its own sake, strive after it myself, and amsometimes guilty of forcing it upon others.  So this was more than Icould pass."That's not quite right," I put in mildly.  "He never made use of theknife."The young clerk twisted his head round in its vase of starch."Chawley Peace killed two policemen," said he."No, he didn't; only one of them was a policeman; and he never killedanybody with a knife."The clerk took the correction like a lamb.  I could not have refrainedfrom making it, to save my skin.  But Raffles rewarded me with asvicious a little kick as he could administer unobserved. "Who wasCharles Peace?" he inquired, with the bland effrontery of any judgeupon the bench.The clerk's reply came pat and unexpected.  "The greatest burgular weever had," said he, "till good old Raffles knocked him out!""The greatest of the pre-Raffleites," the master murmured, as we passedon to the safer memorials of mere murder.  There were misshapen bulletsand stained knives that had taken human life; there were lithe, leanropes which had retaliated after the live letter of the Mosaic law.There was one bristling broadside of revolvers under the longest shelfof closed eyes and swollen throats. There were festoons ofrope-ladders--none so ingenious as ours--and then at last there wassomething that the clerk knew all about. It was a small tincigarette-box, and the name upon the gaudy wrapper was not the name ofSullivan.  Yet Raffles and I knew even more about this exhibit than theclerk."There, now," said our guide, "you'll never guess the history of that!I'll give you twenty guesses, and the twentieth will be no nearer thanthe first.""I'm sure of it, my good fellow," rejoined Raffles, a discreet twinklein his eye.  "Tell us about it, to save time."And he opened, as he spoke, his own old twenty-five tin of purelypopular cigarettes; there were a few in it still, but between thecigarettes were jammed lumps of sugar wadded with cotton-wool.  I sawRaffles weighing the lot in his hand with subtle satisfaction. But theclerk saw merely the mystification which he desired to create."I thought that'd beat you, sir," said he.  "It was an American dodge.Two smart Yankees got a jeweller to take a lot of stuff to a privateroom at Keliner's, where they were dining, for them to choose from.When it came to paying, there was some bother about a remittance; butthey soon made that all right, for they were far too clever to suggesttaking away what they'd chosen but couldn't pay for.  No, all theywanted was that what they'd chosen might be locked up in the safe andconsidered theirs until their money came for them to pay for it.  Allthey asked was to seal the stuff up in something; the jeweller was totake it away and not meddle with it, nor yet break the seals, for aweek or two.  It seemed a fair enough thing, now, didn't it, sir?""Eminently fair," said Raffles sententiously."So the jeweller thought," crowed the clerk.  "You see, it wasn't as ifthe Yanks had chosen out the half of what he'd brought on appro.;they'd gone slow on purpose, and they'd paid for all they could on thenail, just for a blind.  Well, I suppose you can guess what happened inthe end?  The jeweller never heard of those Americans again; and thesefew cigarettes and lumps of sugar were all he found.""Duplicate boxes?  I cried, perhaps a thought too promptly."Duplicate boxes!" murmured Raffles, as profoundly impressed as asecond Mr. Pickwick."Duplicate boxes!" echoed the triumphant clerk.  "Artful beggars, theseAmericans, sir!  You've got to crawss the 'Erring Pond to learn a trickworth one o' that?""I suppose so," assented the grave gentleman wit the silver hair."Unless," he added, as if suddenly inspired, "unless it was that manRaffles.""It couldn't 've bin," jerked the clerk from his conning-tower of acollar.  "He'd gone to Davy Jones long before.""Are you sure?" asked Raffles.  "Was his body ever found?""Found and buried," replied our imaginative friend.  "Malter, I thinkit was; or it may have been Giberaltar.  I forget which.""Besides," I put in, rather annoyed at all this wilful work, yet notindisposed to make a late contribution--"besides, Raffles would neverhave smoked those cigarettes.  There was only one brand for him.  Itwas--let me see--""Sullivans?" cried the clerk, right for once.  "It's all a matter of'abit," he went on, as he replaced the twenty-five tin box with thevulgar wrapper.  "I tried them once, and I didn't like 'em myself.It's all a question of taste.  Now, if you want a good smoke, andcheaper, give me a Golden Gem at quarter of the price.""What we really do want," remarked Raffles mildly, "is to see somethingelse as clever as that last.""Then come this way," said the clerk, and led us into a recess almostmonopolized by the iron-clamped chest of thrilling memory, now a mereplatform for the collection of mysterious objects under a dust-sheet onthe lid.  "These," he continued, unveiling them with an air, "are theRaffles Relics, taken from his rooms in the Albany after his death andburial, and the most complete set we've got.  That's his centre-bit,and this is the bottle of rock-oil he's supposed to have kept dippingit in to prevent making a noise.  Here's the revawlver he used when heshot at a gentleman on the roof down Horsham way; it was afterwardtaken from him on the P. & O. boat before he jumped overboard."I could not help saying I understood that Raffles had never shot atanybody.  I was standing with my back to the nearest window, my hatjammed over my brows and my overcoat collar up to my ears."That's the only time we know about," the clerk admitted; "and itcouldn't be brought 'ome, or his precious pal would have got more thanhe did.  This empty cawtridge is the one he 'id the Emperor's pearl in,on the Peninsular and Orient.  These gimlets and wedges were what heused for fixin' doors.  This is his rope-ladder, with the telescopewalking-stick he used to hook it up with; he's said to have 'ad it withhim the night he dined with the Earl of Thornaby, and robbed the housebefore dinner.  That's his life-preserver; but no one can make out whatthis little thick velvet bag's for, with the two holes and the elawsticround each.  Perhaps you can give a guess, sir?"Raffles had taken up the bag that he had invented for the noiselessfiling of keys.  Now he handled it as though it were a tobacco-pouch,putting in finger and thumb, and shrugging over the puzzle with adelicious face; nevertheless, he showed me a few grains of steel filingas the result of his investigations, and murmured in my ear, "Thesesweet police!  I, for my part, could not but examine the life-preserverwith which I had once smitten Raffles himself to the ground: actually,there was his blood upon it still; and seeing my horror, the clerkplunged into a characteristically garbled version of that incidentalso.  It happened to have come to light among others at the OldBailey, and perhaps had its share in promoting the quality of mercywhich had undoubtedly been exercised on my behalf.  But the presentrecital was unduly trying, and Raffles created a noble diversion bycalling attention to an early photograph of himself, which may stillhang on the wall over the historic chest, but which I had carefullyignored.  It shows him in flannels, after some great feat upon thetented field.  I am afraid there is a Sullivan between his lips, a lookof lazy insolence in the half-shut eyes.  I have since possessed myselfof a copy, and it is not Raffles at his best; but the features areclean-cut and regular; and I often wish that I had lent it to theartistic gentlemen who have battered the statue out of all likeness tothe man."You wouldn't think it of him, would you?" quoth the clerk.  "It makesyou understand how no one ever did think it of him at the time."The youth was looking full at Raffles, with the watery eyes ofunsuspecting innocence.  I itched to emulate the fine bravado of myfriend."You said he had a pal," I observed, sinking deeper into the collar ofmy coat.  "Haven't you got a photograph of him?"The pale clerk gave such a sickly smile, I could have smacked someblood into his pasty face."You mean Bunny?" said the familiar fellow.  "No, sir, he'd be out ofplace; we've only room for real criminals here.  Bunny was neither onething nor the other.  He could follow Raffles, but that's all he coulddo.  He was no good on his own.  Even when he put up the low-down jobof robbing his old 'ome, it's believed he hadn't the 'eart to take thestuff away, and Raffles had to break in a second time for it.  No, sir,we don't bother our heads about Bunny; we shall never hear no more of'im.  He was a harmless sort of rotter, if you awsk me."I had not asked him, and I was almost foaming under the respirator thatI was making of my overcoat collar.  I only hoped that Raffles wouldsay something, and he did."The only case I remember anything about," he remarked, tapping theclamped chest with his umbrella, "was this; and that time, at allevents, the man outside must have had quite as much to do as the oneinside.  May I ask what you keep in it?""Nothing, sir."I imagined more relics inside.  Hadn't he some dodge of getting in andout without opening the lid?""Of putting his head out, you mean," returned the clerk, whoseknowledge of Raffles and his Relics was really most comprehensive onthe whole.  He moved some of the minor memorials and with his penkniferaised the trap-door in the lid."Only a skylight," remarked Raffles, deliciously unimpressed."Why, what else did you expect?" asked the clerk, letting the trap-doordown again, and looking sorry that he had taken so much trouble."A backdoor, at least!" replied Raffles, with such a sly look at methat I had to turn aside to smile.  It was the last time I smiled thatday.The door had opened as I turned, and an unmistakable detective hadentered with two more sight-seers like ourselves.  He wore the hard,round hat and the dark, thick overcoat which one knows at a glance asthe uniform of his grade; and for one awful moment his steely eye wasupon us in a flash of cold inquiry.  Then the clerk emerged from therecess devoted to the Raffles Relics, and the alarming interloperconducted his party to the window opposite the door."Inspector Druce," the clerk informed us in impressive whispers, "whohad the Chalk Farm case in hand.  He'd be the man for Raffles, ifRaffles was alive to-day!""I'm sure he would," was the grave reply.  "I should be very sorry tohave a man like that after me.  But what a run there seems to be uponyour Black Museum!""There isn't reelly, sir," whispered the clerk.  "We sometimes go weekson end without having regular visitors like you two gentlemen. I thinkthose are friends of the Inspector's, come to see the Chalk Farmphotographs, that helped to hang his man.  We've a lot of interestingphotographs, sir, if you like to have a look at them.""If it won't take long," said Raffles, taking out his watch; and as theclerk left our side for an instant he gripped my arm.  "This is a bittoo hot," he whispered, "but we mustn't cut and run like rabbits.  Thatmight be fatal.  Hide your face in the photographs, and leaveeverything to me.  I'll have a train to catch as soon as ever I dare."I obeyed without a word, and with the less uneasiness as I had time toconsider the situation.  It even struck me that Raffles was for onceinclined to exaggerate the undeniable risk that we ran by remaining inthe same room with an officer whom both he and I knew only too well byname and repute.  Raffles, after all, had aged and altered out ofknowledge; but he had not lost the nerve that was equal to a far moredirect encounter than was at all likely to be forced upon us.  On theother hand, it was most improbable that a distinguished detective wouldknow by sight an obscure delinquent like myself; besides, this one hadcome to the front since my day. Yet a risk it was, and I certainly didnot smile as I bent over the album of horrors produced by our guide.  Icould still take an interest in the dreadful photographs of murderousand murdered men; they appealed to the morbid element in my nature; andit was doubtless with degenerate unction that I called Raffles'sattention to a certain scene of notorious slaughter.  There was noresponse. I looked round.  There was no Raffles to respond.  We had allthree been examining the photographs at one of the windows; at anotherthree newcomers were similarly engrossed; and without one word, or asingle sound, Raffles had decamped behind all our backs.Fortunately the clerk was himself very busy gloating over the horrorsof the album; before he looked round I had hidden my astonishment, butnot my wrath, of which I had the instinctive sense to make no secret."My friend's the most impatient man on earth!" I exclaimed.  "He saidhe was going to catch a train, and now he's gone without a word!""I never heard him," said the clerk, looking puzzled."No more did I; but he did touch me on the shoulder," I lied, "and saysomething or other.  I was too deep in this beastly book to pay muchattention.  He must have meant that he was off.  Well, let him be off!I mean to see all that's to be seen."And in my nervous anxiety to allay any suspicions aroused by mycompanion's extraordinary behavior, I outstayed even the eminentdetective and his friends, saw them examine the Raffles Relics, heardthem discuss me under my own nose, and at last was alone with theanemic clerk.  I put my hand in my pocket, and measured him with asidelong eye.  The tipping system is nothing less than a minor bane ofmy existence.  Not that one is a grudging giver, but simply because inso many cases it is so hard to know whom to tip and what to tip him.  Iknow what it is to be the parting guest who has not parted freelyenough, and that not from stinginess but the want of a fine instinct onthe point.  I made no mistake, however, in the case of the clerk, whoaccepted my pieces of silver without demur, and expressed a hope ofseeing the article which I had assured him I was about to write.  Hehas had some years to wait for it, but I flatter myself that thesebelated pages will occasion more interest than offense if they ever domeet those watery eyes.Twilight was falling when I reached the street; the sky behind St.Stephen's had flushed and blackened like an angry face; the lamps werelit, and under every one I was unreasonable enough to look for Raffles.Then I made foolishly sure that I should find him hanging about thestation, and hung thereabouts myself until one Richmond train had gonewithout me.  In the end I walked over the bridge to Waterloo, and tookthe first train to Teddington instead.  That made a shorter walk of it,but I had to grope my way through a white fog from the river to HamCommon, and it was the hour of our cosy dinner when I reached our placeof retirement. There was only a flicker of firelight on the blinds: Iwas the first to return after all.  It was nearly four hours sinceRaffles had stolen away from my side in the ominous precincts ofScotland Yard.  Where could he be?  Our landlady wrung her hands overhim; she had cooked a dinner after her favorite's heart, and I let itspoil before making one of the most melancholy meals of my life.Up to midnight there was no sign of him; but long before this time Ihad reassured our landlady with a voice and face that must have givenmy words the lie.  I told her that Mr. Ralph (as she used to call him)had said something about going to the theatre; that I thought he hadgiven up the idea, but I must have been mistaken, and should certainlysit up for him.  The attentive soul brought in a plate of sandwichesbefore she retired; and I prepared to make a night of it in a chair bythe sitting-room fire.  Darkness and bed I could not face in myanxiety.  In a way I felt as though duty and loyalty called me out intothe winter's night; and yet whither should I turn to look for Raffles?I could think of but one place, and to seek him there would be todestroy myself without aiding him.  It was my growing conviction thathe had been recognized when leaving Scotland Yard, and either takenthen and there, or else hunted into some new place of hiding.  It wouldall be in the morning papers; and it was all his own fault.  He hadthrust his head into the lion's mouth, and the lion's jaws had snapped.Had he managed to withdraw his head in time?There was a bottle at my elbow, and that night I say deliberately thatit was not my enemy but my friend.  It procured me at last somesurcease from my suspense.  I fell fast asleep in my chair before thefire.  The lamp was still burning, and the fire red, when I awoke; butI sat very stiff in the iron clutch of a wintry morning.  Suddenly Islued round in my chair.  And there was Raffles in a chair behind me,with the door open behind him, quietly taking off his boots."Sorry to wake you, Bunny," said he.  "I thought I was behaving like amouse; but after a three hours' tramp one's feet are all heels."I did not get up and fall upon his neck.  I sat back in my chair andblinked with bitterness upon his selfish insensibility.  He should notknow what I had been through on his account."Walk out from town?" I inquired, as indifferently as though he were inthe habit of doing so."From Scotland Yard," he answered, stretching himself before the firein his stocking soles."Scotland Yard?" I echoed.  "Then I was right; that's where you wereall the time; and yet you managed to escape!"I had risen excitedly in my turn."Of course I did," replied Raffles.  "I never thought there would bemuch difficulty about that, but there was even less than I anticipated.I did once find myself on one side of a sort of counter, and an officerdozing at his desk at the other side.  I thought it safest to wake himup and make inquiries about a mythical purse left in a phantom hansomoutside the Carlton.  And the way the fellow fired me out of that wasanother credit to the Metropolitan Police: it's only in the savagecountries that they would have troubled to ask how one had got in.""And how did you?" I asked.  "And in the Lord's name, Raffles, when andwhy?"Raffles looked down on me under raised eyebrows, as he stood with hiscoat tails to the dying fire."How and when, Bunny, you know as well as I do," said he, cryptically."And at last you shall hear the honest why and wherefore.  I had morereasons for going to Scotland Yard, my dear fellow, than I had the faceto tell you at the time.""I don't care why you went there!" I cried.  "I want to know why youstayed, or went back, or whatever it was you may have done.  I thoughtthey had got you, and you had given them the slip!"Raffles smiled as he shook his head."No, no, Bunny; I prolonged the visit, as I paid it, of my own accord.As for my reasons, they are far too many for me to tell you them all;they rather weighed upon me as I walked out; but you'll see them foryourself if you turn round."I was standing with my back to the chair in which I had been asleep;behind the chair was the round lodging-house table; and there, reposingon the cloth with the whiskey and sandwiches, was the whole collectionof Raffles Relics which had occupied the lid of the silver-chest in theBlack Museum at Scotland Yard!  The chest alone was missing.  There wasthe revolver that I had only once heard fired, and there theblood-stained life-preserver, brace-and-bit, bottle of rock-oil, velvetbag, rope-ladder, walking-stick, gimlets, wedges, and even the emptycartridge-case which had once concealed the gift of a civilized monarchto a potentate of color."I was a real Father Christmas," said Raffles, "when I arrived. It's apity you weren't awake to appreciate the scene.  It was more edifyingthan the one I found.  You never caught me asleep in my chair, Bunny!"He thought I had merely fallen asleep in my chair!  He could not seethat I had been sitting up for him all night long!  The hint of atemperance homily, on top of all I had borne, and from Raffles of allmortal men, tried my temper to its last limit--but a flash of lateenlightenment enabled me just to keep it."Where did you hide?" I asked grimly."At the Yard itself.""So I gather; but whereabouts at the Yard?""Can you ask, Bunny?""I am asking.""It's where I once hid before.""You don't mean in the chest?""I do."Our eyes met for a minute."You may have ended up there," I conceded.  "But where did you go firstwhen you slipped out behind my back, and how the devil did you knowwhere to go?""I never did slip out," said Raffles, "behind your back.  I slipped in.""Into the chest?""Exactly."I burst out laughing in his face."My dear fellow, I saw all these things on the lid just afterward. Notone of them was moved.  I watched that detective show them to hisfriends.""And I heard him.""But not from the inside of the chest?""From the inside of the chest, Bunny.  Don't look like that--it'sfoolish.  Try to recall a few words that went before, between the idiotin the collar and me.  Don't you remember my asking him if there wasanything in the chest?""Yes.""One had to be sure it was empty, you see.  Then I asked if there was abackdoor to the chest as well as a skylight.""I remember.""I suppose you thought all that meant nothing?""I didn't look for a meaning.""You wouldn't; it would never occur to you that I might want to findout whether anybody at the Yard had found out that there was somethingprecisely in the nature of a sidedoor--it isn't a backdoor--to thatchest.  Well, there is one; there was one soon after I took the chestback from your rooms to mine, in the good old days.  You push one ofthe handles down--which no one ever does--and the whole of that endopens like the front of a doll's house.  I saw that was what I ought tohave done at first: it's so much simpler than the trap at the top; andone likes to get a thing perfect for its own sake.  Besides, the trickhad not been spotted at the bank, and I thought I might bring it offagain some day; meanwhile, in one's bedroom, with lots of things ontop, what a port in a sudden squall!"I asked why I had never heard of the improvement before, not so much atthe time it was made, but in these later days, when there were fewersecrets between us, and this one could avail him no more. But I did notput the question out of pique.  I put it out of sheer obstinateincredulity.  And Raffles looked at me without replying, until I readthe explanation in his look."I see," I said.  "You used to get into it to hide from me!""My dear Bunny, I am not always a very genial man," he answered; "butwhen you let me have a key of your rooms I could not very well refuseyou one of mine, although I picked your pocket of it in the end.  Iwill only say that when I had no wish to see you, Bunny, I must havebeen quite unfit for human society, and it was the act of a friend todeny you mine.  I don't think it happened more than once or twice.  Youcan afford to forgive a fellow after all these years?"That, yes," I replied bitterly; "but not this, Raffles.""Why not?  I really hadn't made up my mind to do what I did.  I hadmerely thought of it.  It was that smart officer in the same room thatmade me do it without thinking twice.""And we never even heard you!" I murmured, in a voice of involuntaryadmiration which vexed me with myself.  "But we might just as well!" Iwas as quick to add in my former tone."Why, Bunny?""We shall be traced in no time through our ticket of admission.""Did they collect it?""No; but you heard how very few are issued.""Exactly.  They sometimes go weeks on end without a regular visitor. Itwas I who extracted that piece of information, Bunny, and I did nothingrash until I had.  Don't you see that with any luck it will be two orthree weeks before they are likely to discover their loss?"I was beginning to see."And then, pray, how are they going to bring it home to us?  Why shouldthey even suspect us, Bunny?  I left early; that's all I did. You tookmy departure admirably; you couldn't have said more or less if I hadcoached you myself.  I relied on you, Bunny, and you never morecompletely justified my confidence.  The sad thing is that you haveceased to rely on me.  Do you really think that I would leave the placein such a state that the first person who came in with a duster wouldsee that there had been a robbery?"I denied the thought with all energy, though it perished only as Ispoke."Have you forgotten the duster that was over these things, Bunny? Haveyou forgotten all the other revolvers and life preservers that therewere to choose from?  I chose most carefully, and I replaced my relicswith a mixed assortment of other people's which really look just aswell.  The rope-ladder that now supplants mine is, of course, no patchupon it, but coiled up on the chest it really looks much the same.  Tobe sure, there was no second velvet bag; but I replaced my stick withanother quite like it, and I even found an empty cartridge tounderstudy the setting of the Polynesian pearl. You see the sort offellow they have to show people round: do you think he's the kind tosee the difference next time, or to connect it with us if he does?  Oneleft much the same things, lying much as he left them, under adust-sheet which is only taken off for the benefit of the curious, whooften don't turn up for weeks on end."I admitted that we might be safe for three or four weeks.  Raffles heldout his hand."Then let us be friends about it, Bunny, and smoke the cigarette ofSullivan and peace!  A lot may happen in three or four weeks; and whatshould you say if this turned out to be the last as well as the leastof all my crimes?  I must own that it seems to me their natural andfitting end, though I might have stopped more characteristically thanwith a mere crime of sentiment.  No, I make no promises, Bunny; now Ihave got these things, I may be unable to resist using them once more.But with this war one gets all the excitement one requires--and rathermore than usual may happen in three or four weeks?"Was he thinking even then of volunteering for the front?  Had healready set his heart on the one chance of some atonement for hislife--nay, on the very death he was to die?  I never knew, and shallnever know.  Yet his words were strangely prophetic, even to the threeor four weeks in which those events happened that imperilled the fabricof our empire, and rallied her sons from the four winds to fightbeneath her banner on the veldt.  It all seems very ancient historynow.  But I remember nothing better or more vividly than the last wordsof Raffles upon his last crime, unless it be the pressure of his handas he said them, or the rather sad twinkle in his tired eyes.The Last WordThe last of all these tales of Raffles is from a fresher and a sweeterpen.  I give it exactly as it came to me, in a letter which meant moreto me than it can possibly mean to any other reader. And yet, it maystand for something with those for whom these pale reflections have atithe of the charm that the real man had for me; and it is to leavesuch persons thinking yet a little better of him (and not wastinganother thought on me) that I am permitted to retail the very last wordabout their hero and mine.The letter was my first healing after a chance encounter and asleepless night; and I print every word of it except the last.                                     "39 CAMPDEN GROVE COURT, W.,                                     "June 28, 1900."DEAR HARRY: You may have wondered at the very few words I could findto say to you when we met so strangely yesterday.  I did not mean to beunkind.  I was grieved to see you so cruelly hurt and lame.  I couldnot grieve when at last I made you tell me how it happened.  I honorand envy every man of you--every name in those dreadful lists that fillthe papers every day.  But I knew about Mr. Raffles, and I did not knowabout you, and there was something I longed to tell you about him,something I could not tell you in a minute in the street, or indeed byword of mouth at all.  That is why I asked you for your address."You said I spoke as if I had known Mr. Raffles.  Of course I haveoften seen him playing cricket, and heard about him and you. But I onlyonce met him, and that was the night after you and I met last.  I havealways supposed that you knew all about our meeting.  Yesterday I couldsee that you knew nothing.  So I have made up my mind to tell you everyword."That night--I mean the next night--they were all going out to severalplaces, but I stayed behind at Palace Gardens.  I had gone up to thedrawing-room after dinner, and was just putting on the lights, when inwalked Mr. Raffles from the balcony.  I knew him at once, because Ihappened to have watched him make his hundred at Lord's only the daybefore.  He seemed surprised that no one had told me he was there, butthe whole thing was such a surprise that I hardly thought of that.  Iam afraid I must say that it was not a very pleasant surprise.  I feltinstinctively that he had come from you, and I confess that for themoment it made me very angry indeed.  Then in a breath he assured methat you knew nothing of his coming, that you would never have allowedhim to come, but that he had taken it upon himself as your intimatefriend and one who would be mine as well.  (I said that I would tellyou every word.)"Well, we stood looking at each other for some time, and I was nevermore convinced of anybody's straightness and sincerity; but he wasstraight and sincere with me, and true to you that night, whatever hemay have been before and after.  So I asked him why he had come, andwhat had happened; and he said it was not what had happened, but whatmight happen next; so I asked him if he was thinking of you, and hejust nodded, and told me that I knew very well what you had done.  ButI began to wonder whether Mr. Raffles himself knew, and I tried to gethim to tell me what you had done, and he said I knew as well as he didthat you were one of the two men who had come to the house the nightbefore.  I took some time to answer.  I was quite mystified by hismanner.  At last I asked him how he knew.  I can hear his answer now."'Because I was the other man,' he said quite quietly; 'because I ledhim blindfold into the whole business, and would rather pay the shotthan see poor Bunny suffer for it.'"Those were his words, but as he said them he made their meaning clearby going over to the bell, and waiting with his finger ready to ringfor whatever assistance or protection I desired.  Of course I would notlet him ring at all; in fact, at first I refused to believe him.  Thenhe led me out into the balcony, and showed me exactly how he had got upand in.  He had broken in for the second night running, and all to tellme that the first night he had brought you with him on false pretences.He had to tell me a great deal more before I could quite believe him.But before he went (as he had come) I was the one woman in the worldwho knew that A. J. Raffles, the great cricketer, and the so-called'amateur cracksman' of equal notoriety, were one and the same person."He had told me his secret, thrown himself on my mercy, and put hisliberty if not his life in my hands, but all for your sake, Harry, toright you in my eyes at his own expense.  And yesterday I could seethat you knew nothing whatever about it, that your friend had diedwithout telling you of his act of real and yet vain self-sacrifice!Harry, I can only say that now I understand your friendship, and thedreadful lengths to which it carried you.  How many in your place wouldnot have gone as far for such a friend? Since that night, at any rate,I for one have understood.  It has grieved me more than I can tell you,Harry, but I have always understood."He spoke to me quite simply and frankly of his life.  It was wonderfulto me then that he should speak of it as he did, and still morewonderful that I should sit and listen to him as I did. But I haveoften thought about it since, and have long ceased to wonder at myself.There was an absolute magnetism about Mr. Raffles which neither you norI could resist.  He had the strength of personality which is adifferent thing from strength of character; but when you meet bothkinds together, they carry the ordinary mortal off his or her feet.You must not imagine you are the only one who would have served andfollowed him as you did. When he told me it was all a game to him, andthe one game he knew that was always exciting, always full of dangerand of drama, I could just then have found it in my heart to try thegame myself! Not that he treated me to any ingenious sophistries orparadoxical perversities.  It was just his natural charm and humor, anda touch of sadness with it all, that appealed to something deeper thanone's reason and one's sense of right.  Glamour, I suppose, is theword.  Yet there was far more in him than that.  There were depths,which called to depths; and you will not misunderstand me when I say Ithink it touched him that a woman should listen to him as I did, and insuch circumstances.  I know that it touched me to think of such a lifeso spent, and that I came to myself and implored him to give it all up.I don't think I went on my knees over it.  But I am afraid I did cry;and that was the end.  He pretended not to notice anything, and then inan instant he froze everything with a flippancy which jarred horriblyat the time, but has ever since touched me more than all the rest.  Iremember that I wanted to shake hands at the end.  But Mr. Raffles onlyshook his head, and for one instant his face was as sad as it wasgallant and gay all the rest of the time.  Then he went as he had come,in his own dreadful way, and not a soul in the house knew that he hadbeen.  And even you were never told!"I didn't mean to write all this about your own friend, whom you knewso much better yourself, yet you see that even you did not know hownobly he tried to undo the wrong he had done you; and now I think Iknow why he kept it to himself.  It is fearfully late--or early--I seemto have been writing all night--and I will explain the matter in thefewest words.  I promised Mr. Raffles that I would write to you, Harry,and see you if I could.  Well, I did write, and I did mean to see you,but I never had an answer to what I wrote.  It was only one line, and Ihave long known you never received it.  I could not bring myself towrite more, and even those few words were merely slipped into one ofthe books which you had given me.  Years afterward these books, with myname in them, must have been found in your rooms; at any rate they werereturned to me by somebody; and you could never have opened them, forthere was my line where I had left it.  Of course you had never seenit, and that was all my fault.  But it was too late to write again.Mr. Raffles was supposed to have been drowned, and everything was knownabout you both.  But I still kept my own independent knowledge tomyself; to this day, no one else knows that you were one of the two inPalace Gardens; and I still blame myself more than you may think fornearly everything that has happened since."You said yesterday that your going to the war and getting woundedwiped out nothing that had gone before.  I hope you are not growingmorbid about the past.  It is not for me to condone it, and  yet I knowthat Mr. Raffles was what he was because he loved danger and adventure,and that you were what you were because you loved Mr. Raffles.  But,even admitting it was all as bad as bad could be, he is dead, and youare punished.  The world forgives, if it does not forget.  You areyoung enough to live everything down.  Your part in the war will helpyou in more ways than one.  You were always fond of writing.  You havenow enough to write about for a literary lifetime.  You must make a newname for yourself.  You must Harry, and you will!"I suppose you know that my aunt, Lady Melrose, died some years ago?She was the best friend I had in the world, and it is thanks to herthat I am living my own life now in the one way after my own heart.This is a new block of flats, one of those where they do everything foryou; and though mine is tiny, it is more than all I shall ever want.One does just exactly what one likes--and you must blame that habit forall that is least conventional in what I have said. Yet I should likeyou to understand why it is that I have said so much, and, indeed, leftnothing unsaid.  It is because I want never to have to say or hearanother word about anything that is past and over.  You may answer thatI run no risk!  Nevertheless, if you did care to come and see me someday as an old friend, we might find one or two new points of contact,for I am rather trying to write myself!  You might almost guess as muchfrom this letter; it is long enough for anything; but, Harry, if itmakes you realize that one of your oldest friends is glad to have seenyou, and will be gladder still to see you again, and to talk ofanything and everything except the past, I shall cease to be ashamedeven of its length!"And so good-by for the present from                                                        "____"I omit her name and nothing else.  Did I not say in the beginning thatit should never be sullied by association with mine?  And yet--andyet--even as I write I have a hope in my heart of hearts which is notquite consistent with that sentiment.  It is as faint a hope as manever had, and yet its audacity makes the pen tremble in my fingers.But, if it be ever realized, I shall owe more than I could deserve in acentury of atonement to one who atoned more nobly than I ever can.  Andto think that to the end I never heard one word of it from Raffles!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Thief in the Night, by E. W.

H. LESLIE    _It is said that Life crawled up from the slime of the sea-bottoms    and became Man because of inherent greatness bred into him before    the dawn of time. But perhaps this urge was not as formless as we    think._Buos was chastising Laloi as they sped through the ionosphere of thegreen planet. But like the airy creature she was, Laloi ignored thecriticism and rippled zephyr-like through a clump of daffodils when theycompleted their descent."So pretty," she sighed. She flung her incorporeal substance around eachflower, absorbing their unified beauty of scent, sight, and feel. Buosshrilled himself into a column of wind to express his displeasure at herattitude."Stupid, silly, shallow thing!" he said. "If the others only knew howyou behaved--""And you'll be glad to tell them, of course," she said, extending herfingers of air into the roots of the wind-bent grass. She rolled acrossthe hill ecstatically, and Buos followed in grumbling billows of energy."I don't carry tales," he replied, somewhat mortified. "But we're hereas observers, and you insist upon making this world a plaything ...""I love it," she said happily. "It's so warm and green."Buos whipped in front of her angrily. "This is an assignment," hesnapped, his emotion crackling the air about him. "We have a purposehere.""Purpose!" she groaned, settling over a patch of crowded clover. "Howmany centuries will this assignment last?""This world is young," said Buos. "It will take time.""But how long?" she asked mournfully. "Our world will be shrivelled anddead before these people have the knowledge to rescue us. Why can't wespend our lives here ...""And leave the others behind?" said Buos stiffly. "Selfish being," hesaid sadly. "This world cannot support one-fourth our number.""Oh, I know, I know," Laloi said. "I do not mean to say such things. Iam twisted by my sorrow ..." As if to express her self-abnegation, shecorkscrewed out of the clover and into a thin spiral ofnear-nothingness.       *       *       *       *       *"Settle down, foolish one," said Buos, not unkindly. "I know yourfeelings. Do you think I am not tormented as well, by the slow pace ofthese Earth-things? Crude, barbaric beings, like children with thebuilding blocks of science. They have such a long way to go ...""And so few _know_," said Laloi despairingly. "A handful of seeingminds, tens of millions of ignorant ones. Not even firstprinciples--they're stupid, stupid!""But they will learn," Buos said stubbornly. "That is historical fact.Someday, they will know the true meanings of matter and light andenergy. Slowly, yes, slowly. But in terms of their growth, it will seemlike great speed to them ...""And in terms of our world," said Laloi, spinning sadly over the ground,"they may be far too late ...""No!" In his excitement, Buos forgot himself and entwined with theflowing form of the she-creature, and the result was a rending of theair that cracked like heat lightning over the field. "No," he repeatedagain. "They must not be too late. They must learn. They must build fromthe very ground, and then they must fly. And then their eyes must belifted to the stars, and desire must extend them to all the universe ...""It seems so hopeless--""It cannot be! Our destiny is not extinction. They must come to us, infleets of silver, and replant our soil, and send towers of greenshooting into our sky, breathing out air.""Yes, yes!" Laloi cried pitifully. "It will be that way, Buos. It willbe that way! That man-creature, we will begin with him ..."Buos floated earthward disconsolately. "He is a dreamer," he saidcheerlessly. "His mind is good; he thinks of tomorrow; he is one of theknowing ones. But he cannot be moved, Laloi. His thoughts may fester anddie in the prison of his brain ...""No, they will not! We have watched him. He understands much. He willhelp us!""I have seen his like before," said Buos hopelessly. "He thinks and heworks, and his conclusions will die stillborn, for lack of a movingforce ...""Then let us provide it, Buos. Let us move him!""With what?" said the other disdainfully. "Arms of nothing? Hands ofvacuum? A breeze against his cheek? A rustle of leaves? A meaninglesswhistle in his ear?""Let us try. Let us try! This empty watchfulness is destroying us. Letus move him, Buos. Come!"Faster than the sky-sweeping clouds they flew, over the gently swellinghills, over the yearning branches of the trees, over the calm bluewaters of the lakes. Swifter than the flight of birds they came,searching for a thinking mind ...They found him at last."He knows, he knows," said Laloi. "Only now to say 'this is so because'and 'this must happen when'! Only to think--to understand--"They hovered over his head, in a pandemonium of helplessness. Theywhirled, and tumbled, and shrilly circled. And then to Laloi theinspiration came.The apple, caught by a sudden gust of wind, twisted from the tenuoushold of the tree and fell to the ground.The man, startled, picked it up.He gazed at it, deep in thought.THE ENDTranscriber's Note:    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1957.

"Ay, take them," quoth the gamesome king, "but not a heifer more.    Choose out thine own, nor hinder us; yet choose without a slip."    The isleman laughed and whistled, his finger at his lip.    Oh, swift the bright-eyed Vigi went darting through the herd    And singled out his master's neat with a nose that never erred,    And drave the star-marked twenty forth, to the wonder of the king,    Who bought the hound right honestly, at the price of a broad gold ring.    If the herddog dreamed of an Irish voice and of cattle on the hill,    He told it not to Olaf the King, whose will was Vigi's will,    But followed him far in faithful love and bravely helped him win    His famous fight with Thorir Hart and Raud, the wizard Finn.    Above the clamor and the clang shrill sounded Vigi's bark,    And when the groaning ship of Raud drew seaward to the dark,    And Thorir Hart leapt to the land, bidding his rowers live    Who could, Olaf and Vigi strained hard on the fugitive.    'Twas Vigi caught the runner's heel and stayed the windswift flight    Till Olaf's well-hurled spear had changed the day to endless night    For Thorir Hart, but not before his sword had stung the hound,    Whom the heroes bore on shield to ship, all grieving for his wound.    Now proud of heart was Vigi to be borne to ship on shield,    And many a day thereafter, when the bitter thrust was healed,    Would the dog leap up on the Vikings and coax with his Irish wit    Till 'mid laughter a shield was leveled, and Vigi rode on it.PUPPYHOOD    "Only the envy was, that it lasted not still, or, now it is past,    cannot by imagination, much less description, be recovered to a    part of that spirit it had in the gliding by."    --Jonson's _Masque of Hymen_.Sigurd was related to Vigi only by the line of Scandinavian literature.The Lady of Cedar Hill was enjoying the long summer daylights andmarvelous rainbows of Norway, when word reached her that her livestockhad been increased by the advent of ten puppies, and back there camefor them all, by return mail, heroic names straight out of thatsplendid old saga of _Burnt Njal_.But this is not the beginning of the story. Indeed, Sigurd's storyprobably emerges from a deeper distance than the story of mankind.Millions of glad creatures, his tawny ancestors, ranged the Highlands,slowly giving their wild hearts to the worship of man, and left nopedigree. The utmost of our knowledge only tells us that Sigurd's sire,the rough-coated collie Barwell Ralph (pronounced R[=a]fe), bornSeptember 3, 1894, was the son of Heather Ralph, a purple name withwind and ripples in it, himself the son of the sonorous StracathroRalph, whose parents were Christopher, a champion of far renown, andStracathro Fancy; and of lovely Apple Blossom, offspring of MetchleyWonder and Grove Daisy. Ralph's mother of blessed memory was AughtonBessie; her parents were Edgbarton Marvel, son of that same championChristopher and Sweet Marie, and Wellesbourne Ada, in proudest Scotchdescent from Douglas and Lady.Sigurd's mother, Trapelo Dora, born May 16, 1900, was also a sable andwhite rough collie. Her sire, Barwell Masterpiece, son of Rightaway andCaermarther Lass, had for dashing grandsires Finsbury Pilot andRingleader, and for gentle grandams, Miss Purdue and Jane. Her mother,Barwell Queenie, came of the great lineage of Southport Perfection andnumbered among her ancestors a Beauty, a Princess and a Barwell Bess.Those ten puppies, poor innocents, had something to live up to.But their sire, Ralph, cared nothing for his distinguished progenitors,not even for that prize grandmother who had sold for eight hundredpounds, in comparison with the Lady of Cedar Hill, whom he franklyadored. His most blissful moments were those in which he was allowed tosit up on the lounge beside her, his paw in her palm, his head on hershoulder, his brown eyes rolling up to her face with a look of liquidecstasy. He had been the guardian of Cedar Hill several years when Doraarrived. Shipped from those same Surrey kennels in which Ralph utteredhis first squeal, her long journey over sea and land had been afearsome experience. When the expressman dumped a travelworn box,labeled _Live Dog_, in the generous country house hall, and proceededwith some nervousness to knock off the slats, the assembled householdgrouped themselves behind the most reassuring pieces of furniture forprotection against the outrush of a ferocious beast. But the delicatelittle collie that shot forth was herself in such terror that even thewaiting dish of warm milk and bread, into which she splashed at once,could not allay her panic. From room to room she raced, hiding undersofas and behind screens, finding nothing that gave her peace, not evenwhen she came up against a long mirror and fronted her own reflection,another scared little collie, which she tried to kiss with a puzzledtongue against the glass. Then in sauntered the lordly Ralph, whoseindignant growl at the intruder died in his astonished throat as Doraconfidingly flung herself upon him, leaping up and clinging to hiswell-groomed neck with grimy forelegs quivering for joy. Ralph was adog who prided himself on his respectability. Affronted, shocked, heshook off this impudent young hussy, but homesick little Dora would notbe repelled. Here, at last, was something she recognized, somethingthat belonged to her lost world of the kennels. Let Ralph be as surlyas he might, he had her perfect confidence from the outset, while thewinsome Lady of Cedar Hill had to coax for days before Dora would makethe first timid response to these strange overtures of humanfriendship.As for Ralph, he decided to tolerate the nuisance and in course of timefound her gypsy pranks amusing, even although she treated him withincreasing levity. As he took his prolonged siesta, she would friskabout him, biting first one ear and then the other, till at last hewould rise in magnificent menace and go chasing after her, hismiddle-aged dignity melting from him in the fun of the frolic, till hisantics outcapered her own.Dora's wits were brighter than his. If the Lady of Cedar Hill, aftertossing a ball several times to the further end of the hall, for themto dash after in frantic emulation and bring back to her, only made afeint of throwing it, Ralph would hunt and hunt through the far cornersof the room, while Dora, soon satisfying herself that the ball was notthere, would dance back again and nose about the hands and pockets ofher mistress, evidently concluding that the ball had not been thrown.Or if a door were closed upon them, Ralph would scratch long andfuriously at its lower edge, while Dora, finding such efforts futile,would spring up and strike with her paw at the knob.The date made momentous by the arrival of the ten puppies was August20, 1902. The Lady of Cedar Hill, home from the Norland, found Dorafull of the prettiest pride in her fuzzy babies, while Ralph, stalkingabout in jealous disgust, did his best to convey the impression thatthose troublesome absurdities were in no way related to him. This wasnot so easy, for they, one and all, were smitten with admiration oftheir august father and determination to follow in his steps. No soonerdid Ralph, after casting one glare of contempt upon his family, strolloff nonchalantly toward the famous Maze, the Mecca of all the childrenin the neighboring factory town, than a line of eager puppies wentwaddling after. Glancing uneasily back, Ralph would give vent to afierce paternal snarl, whereat squat on their stomachs would grovel thetrain, every puppy wriggling all over with delicious fright. But nosooner did Ralph proceed, with an attempt to resume his carelessbachelor poise, than again he found those ten preposterous puppiespanting along in a wavy procession at his very heels.Only one of the puppies failed to thrive. Fragile little Kari,inappropriately named for one of the most terrible of the Vikings, diedat the end of three months. But Helgi and Helga, Hauskuld andHildigunna, Hrut, Unna and Flosi, Gunnar and Njal, waxed in size,activity and naughtiness until, in self-defense, the Lady of Cedar Hillbegan to give them away to her fortunate friends. Joy-of-Life wasinvited over to make an early choice. As Wellesley is not far fromCedar Hill, whose mistress she dearly loved, she went again and again,studying the youngsters with characteristic earnestness. They werenearly full-grown before she drove me over to confirm her election. Thedogs were called up to meet us, and the lawn before the house looked tomy bewildered gaze one white and golden blur of cavorting collies."Are they all here?" I asked, after vain efforts to count the heads inthat whirl of perpetual motion."All but the barn dog," replied the Lady of Cedar Hill. "He is keptchained for the present, until he gets wonted to his humble sphere, butwe will go down and call on him."He saw us first. An excited bark made me aware of a young collie,almost erect in the barn door, tugging madly against his chain. TheLady of Cedar Hill, with a loving laugh, ran forward to release him.His gambol of gratitude nearly knocked her down, but before she hadrecovered her balance he was too far away for rebuke, romping,bounding, wheeling about the meadow, such a glorious image of wildgrace and rapturous freedom that our hearts gladdened as we looked."But he is the most beautiful of all," I exclaimed."Oh, no," said the instructed Lady of Cedar Hill, "not from theblue-ribbon point of view." And she went on to explain that Njal, thebiggest of the nine, was quite too big for a collie of suchdistinguished pedigree. His happy body, gleaming pure gold in the sun,with its snowy, tossing ruff, was both too tall and too long. Hiswhite-tipped tail was too luxuriantly splendid. The cock of his shiningears was not in the latest kennel style. His honest muzzle was a trifleblunt. He was, in short, lacking in various fine points of collieelegance, and so, while his dainty, aristocratic brothers and sisterswere destined to be the ornaments of gentle homes, Njal was relegatedto a life of service, in care of the cattle, and to that end had beenfor the month past kept in banishment at the barn.But Njal had persistently rebelled against his destiny. He declined toexplore the barn, always straining at the end of his chain in thedoorway, watching with wistful eyes the frolics of his mother, hardlymore than a puppy herself, with her overwhelming children. She seemedto have forgotten that Njal was one of her own. He would not makefriends with the dairymen nor with the coachman, and though he showedan occasional interest in the horses, he utterly ignored the cows andcalves whose guardian he was intended to be. Even now, in defiance ofsocial distinctions, he dashed into the house, which, as we camehurrying up behind him, resounded with the reproachful voices of themaids."Njal, get out! You know you're not allowed in here.""Njal, jump down off that bed this minute. The impudence of him!""Njal, drop that ball. It doesn't belong to you. Be off to the barn."The maids, aided by Njal's brothers and sisters, who struck me asofficious, had just succeeded in chasing him out as we came to thedoor, but he flashed past us, tail erect, enthusiastically bent ongreeting his glorious sire, who was majestically pacing up toinvestigate this unseemly commotion."Poor Njal! Even more than the rest, he idolizes his father," said theLady of Cedar Hill, as Ralph met his son with a growl and a cuff.Crestfallen at last, Njal trotted back to his mistress and stood gazingup at her with great, amber eyes, that held, if ever eyes did, woundedlove and a beseeching for comfort. She stroked his head, but bade oneof the maids fetch a leash and take him back where he belonged.I glanced at Joy-of-Life. That glance was all she had been waiting for."Njal is my dog," she said."What! Not Njal!" protested the Lady of Cedar Hill. "Why, in the countof collie points----""But I'm not looking for a dog to keep me supplied with blue ribbons. Iwant a friend. Njal has a soul."The Lady of Cedar Hill bent a doubtful glance on me."Oh, we've just settled that," smiled Joy-of-Life. "She would ratherhave him than all the other eight."So it was that on the last day of June, 1903, we drove again to CedarHill to bring our collie home."It's a queer choice," laughed our hostess, as she poured tea, "but atleast you need not put yourselves out for him. He is used to the barn,and a box of straw in your cellar will be quite good enough for Njal."She rang for more cream. No maid appeared. Surprised, she rang again,sharply. Still no response. One of the ever numerous guests rose andwent out to the kitchen. She came back laughing."All the maids are kneeling around Njal, disputing as to whose ribbonbecomes him best and worshiping him as if he were the golden calf. Andreally William has given an amazing shine to that yellow coat of his.It is astonishing what a splendid fellow the barn-puppy has grown tobe."In came Jane with the cream, blushing for her delay, but lingering tosee what reception would be given the collie who walked politely a stepor two behind.Groomed till he shone, his new leather collar adorned with a flaringorange-satin bow, Njal entered with the quiet stateliness of one todrawing-rooms born, widely waving his tail in salutation to the entirecompany. But it was to the Lady of Cedar Hill that he went and againsther side that he pressed close, while his questioning eyes passed fromface to face, for he seemed already aware of an impending change in hisfortunes.The phaeton was brought to the door. Joy-of-Life and I took our places,and the Lady of Cedar Hill, who gave her puppies away right royally,passed in a new leash and complete box of brushes. Then the coachmanlifted Njal, an armful of sprawling legs, and deposited him at ourfeet. The collie sat upright, making no effort to escape. But as hismistress perched on the carriage step to give him a good-bye hug, hiseyes looked back into hers so wistfully, and yet so trustfully, thatone of the maids in the background was heard to sniff."Be a good doggie," the beloved voice adjured him, "and don't give yournew ladies any trouble on the long drive."If he promised, he certainly kept his word. All the way he sat quietlywhere he had been put, erect and alert, watching the road and bestowinga very special regard on every dog and cat we passed. When we reachedour modest home, he jumped out at our bidding, entered the open doorand proceeded steadily from room to room, looking long out of eachwindow as if hoping to find a familiar view. We had been warned thatstrange surroundings would probably affect his appetite, but Njal wasfar too sensible a collie to disdain a good dinner. He took to hispuppy-biscuit and gravy with such a relish that, in an incredibly shortperiod, the empty dish was dancing on the gravel under the hopefulinsistence of his tongue. Homesickness, however, came on with the dusk.He gazed longingly from the piazza down the road, and when we attemptedto introduce him to the cellar and his waiting box of plentiful cleanstraw, he resisted in a sudden agony of fright.Njal had known nothing of cellars, and the terror with which thatunnatural, lonesome hollow under ground affected him lasted for twofull years. Then a visiting nephew, boy-wise in the ways of animals,romping with him, purposely scampered back and forth through thecellar, running in at one door and out at the other, so that the dog,in the ardor of the chase, had traversed that realm of awful chill andgloom before he realized where he was. Later on, one torrid afternoon,I carried a bone down cellar and, sitting on a log beside it, chantedits praises until, tempted beyond endurance, Njal came tumblingheadlong downstairs and fell upon it. For a little while longer, hewould not stay in the cellar without companionship, but at last hisdread was so entirely overcome that, in the midsummer heats, thecellar, and especially, to our regret, the coal bin, was his favoriteresort.But on this first night he would have none of it. We were reluctant touse force and compromised on the bathroom. Here he obediently lay downand bore his lot in silence till dead of night, when at last the risingtide of desolation so overswelled his puppy heart that a sudden wail,which would have done credit to a banshee, woke everybody in the house.The second evening he made his own arrangements. Our academic home wassimple in its appointments,--so simple that Joy-of-Life and I oftenmerrily quoted to each other the comment of a calling freshman:"When _I'm_ old, I mean to have a dear little house just like this one,all furnished with nothing but books."The barn-dog inspected our chambers and promptly decided that only thebest was good enough for him. This approved bower was then occupied bythe Dryad, over whose couch was appropriately spread a velvety greencover, a foreign treasure of her own, marvelous for many-huedembroidery. As bedtime came on, Njal disappeared and was nowhere to befound, until the Dryad's pealing laugh brought us to her room, where aball of golden collie, even the tail demurely tucked in, was sleepingdesperately hard in the middle of the choice coverlet. One anxious eyeblinked at us and then shut up tighter than ever. Njal was sodetermined not to be budged that the tender-hearted Dryad took his partand pleaded against our amateur efforts at discipline."Poor puppy! Let him be my room-mate tonight. He's so new and scared.He can sleep over there on the lounge under that farthest window and hewill not bother me one bit."Njal consented to this transfer, but in the small hours homesicknessagain swept his soul and he jumped up beside the Dryad, to whom henestled close. The night was excessively hot, and the morning found apallid lady snatching a belated nap on the lounge under the far window,while Njal remained in proud possession of the bed.Joy-of-Life thereafter insisted on leashing him at night in the lowerhall, where we would spread out for him the Thunder-and-Lightning Rug,an embarrassing gift for which we had never before been able to find ause. There he would contentedly take his post, the conscious guardianof the house, his white and yellow in vivid contrast to the black andscarlet of the rug, and his blue-figured Japanese bowl of water withineasy reach. This disposition of our problem worked both well and ill,since Njal found distraction from his diminishing attacks of nostalgiain trying with his sharp white teeth the toughness of the leashes whichsucceeded one another in costly succession. But as a watch dog he tookhimself most seriously, though not greatly to the furtherance of ourrepose. From the depths of slumber he would leap up with a dynamicbark, accompanied by a bass growl, as if there were two of him,spinning around and around upon his leash, until we all rose from ourbeds, grasping electric torches, and sped downstairs to behold a fatbeetle scuttling off across the floor or to hear the receding scamperof a mouse behind the wainscot. On the night before the Fourth,outraged by such a racket as he had never heard before, ourten-months-old protector succeeded in making more noise than all thehorns, torpedoes and firecrackers in our patriotic neighborhood.We celebrated the national holiday by changing his name, which soundedin the mouth of the mocker too much like _miaul_, to that of theshining hero of the _Volsunga Saga_. Joy-of-Life hesitated a littlelest the Lady of Cedar Hill should deem her own Norse hero, Burnt Njal,"gentle and generous," treated with discourtesy, but I pleaded that inall likelihood our home would never again be blessed with anything soyoung and so yellow, so altogether fit to bear the honors of the GoldenSigurd. The collie readily accepted his new name, but never forgot theold, and even to the last year of his sunny life, if the word Njal werespoken, however softly, would glance up with bright recognition.Sigurd bore himself through that first July with such civility anddignity that we did not dream how homesick he really was,--thattowering puppy, who looked absurdly tall as we took him out to walk onhis latest leash. He submitted to this needless indignity as hesubmitted to the long chain that bound him to the piazza railing, withmagnanimous forbearance. We had used a rope at first, but he felt it apoint of honor to gnaw this apart, coming cheerfully to meet us with asection of our clothesline trailing from his collar. Through thesefirst weeks he had much to occupy his mind and tax his fortitude in theengine whistles and rumble of trains, the whirr of electric cars,Cecilia's energetic broom that threatened to brush him off the piazza,the manners of the market-man, who, unlearned in Norse mythology,injuriously called him Jigger, and divers other perils and excitements.His ears were forever on the cock and his tail busy with the agitatedutterance of his changing emotions. When we ventured, after a little,to let him run loose, he investigated the immediate territory but keptwithin call, bounding to meet us as we came out to look for him. Thefirst time that he actually ventured off on an independent quest, hecame tearing back after forty minutes' absence as if he had beenputting a girdle round the earth, insisting on a complete and repeatedfamily welcome as well as a second breakfast. My first vivid sense ofthe comfort of having a dog smote me on the edge of a tired evening,when, trudging home from a long day in one of the Boston libraries, asudden nose was thrust into my hand and a gleaming shape leapt up outof the roadside shadows in jubilant welcome. So we supposed our colliewas light-hearted.But one after-sunset hour, when we had feloniously sallied out to stripthe flower-beds of an absent neighbor, Sigurd, in amiable attendance,suddenly started, wheeled and was off down the hill like a shimmeringarrow of Apollo. How was he aware of her at that distance, in thatdusk, the Lady of Cedar Hill? He flung himself like a happy avalancheupon her and poured out all the bewilderment and yearning, thelonesomeness and love of his loyal soul, in a shrill, ecstatic tremolothat we came to designate as "Sigurd's lyric cry." It was reserved fora favored few, objects of romantic devotion; it was rarely vouchsafedto the commonplace members of his own household; but it never failedthe Lady of Cedar Hill, though months might elapse between her visits.On this her first coming, his joy was touching to see. He pressed closeto her side as she walked up the hill and after she had seated herselfin a piazza chair he tried to climb into her lap as in his fuzzypuppyhood, and succeeded, too, though he hung over her knees like ayellow festoon, his feet touching the floor on either side and hisplumy tail fanning her face. Yet when she went away, he made no effortto follow. He watched her intently from the piazza steps as she passeddown the hill and turned the corner. When she was out of sight, tailand ears drooped and he came in of his own accord, soberly lying downon the Thunder-and-Lightning Rug, beside his leash. Feelings were allvery well in their way, but duty was supreme. He had a house to guardfrom beetles and other bugbears of the night.Sigurd was so big and strong that he needed plenty of exercise. Beforehe came, a spacious "run" had been provided for him on the wild bank,hardly yet redeemed from the forest, back of the house, but this hepromptly repudiated for all purposes of frolic. He seemed to regard itas a singing-school, for, dragged out there "to play," he would sit onhis haunches and practice dirge-music in howls of intolerable crescendountil a decent respect for the opinions of the neighbors obliged us tobring him in. We called him our gymnasium, walking and romping with himall we could, but our utmost was not enough. So we would drive out,once or twice a week, along the less frequented roads, thoughautomobiles were not so many then, to give the boy a "scimper-scamper."He delighted to accompany the carriage, running alongside with briefdashes down the bank for water or into the woods after a squirrel. Whenhe was tired, he would run close and look up, asking for a lift, butafter a few minutes of panting repose, lying across the phaeton infront of our feet, nose and tail in alarming proximity to the wheels,he would want to scramble out and race again.The first time that we took him back to Cedar Hill was a thrillingevent for Sigurd. He had been running most of the way and jumped injust before we reached familiar landmarks. As soon as these appeared,all his weariness vanished. Standing erect, eyes shining, ears prickedup, nose quivering, his tail thumping the dashboard with louder andlouder blows, he sent his lyric cry like a bugle through the air,heralding our approach so well that all his kindred yet remaining onthe estate, as well as his original mistress, her guests and her maids,were drawn up on the lawn and steps to receive us. Sigurd sprang outbefore the horse had stopped and tore up with a special squeal offilial devotion to greet his sire, Ralph the Magnificent, who wasbarely restrained by a circle of strenuous hands on his collar fromhurling himself in fury on this most obnoxious of his sons. Doratrotted up and sniffed at him with coquettish curiosity, as ifwondering who this golden young gallant might be, but her bearing couldby no stretch of language by styled maternal. Gunnar, a puppy withevery mark of high descent, now installed on the estate as crownprince, was so infected by his father's rage that they both had to beshut up during our stay. Sigurd pranced rapturously all over the place,visiting every scene of his childhood with the conspicuous exception ofthe barn. He disdained to recognize the cows and gave but asupercilious curl of his tail even to the most affable of the dairymen.A cattle-dog, indeed! He invited himself to tea in the drawing-room andhad the further impertinence to take a snooze on Dora's own cushion,close to the skirts of the Lady of Cedar Hill. She doubted whether hewould be willing to go back with us, but when the phaeton was driven tothe door, Sigurd rushed out to meet it and leapt into his place beforewe had finished our more ceremonious farewells. We knew then that hewas really ours.THE DOGS OF BETHLEHEM    Many a starry night had they known,    Melampo, Lupina and Cubil[=o]n,        Shepherd-dogs, keeping        The flocks, unsleeping,    Serving their masters for crust and bone.    Many a starlight but never like this,    For star on star was a chrysalis        Whence there went soaring        A winged, adoring    Splendor out-pouring a carol of bliss.    Sniffing and bristling the gaunt dogs stood,    Till the seraphs, who smiled at their hardihood,        Calmed their panic        With talismanic    Touches like wind in the underwood.    In the dust of the road like gold-dust blown,    Melampo, Lupina and Cubil[=o]n        Saw strange kings, faring        On camels, bearing    Treasures too bright for a mortal throne.    Shepherds three on their crooks a-leap    Sped after the kings up the rugged steep        To Bethlehem; only        The dogs, left lonely,    Stayed by the fold and guarded the sheep.    Faithful, grim hearts! The marvelous glow    Flooded e'en these with its overflow,        Wolfishness turning        Into a yearning    To worship the highest a dog may know.    When dawn brought the shepherds, each to his own,    Melampo, Lupina and Cubil[=o]n        Bounded to meet them,        Frolicked to greet them,    Eager to serve them for love alone.GROWING UP    "His years were full; his years were joyous; why    Must love be sorrow, when his gracious name    Recalls his lovely life of limb and eye?"    --Swinburne's _At a Dog's Grave_.Now that we realized not only that we had adopted Sigurd but thatSigurd had adopted us, we entered into an ever deepening enjoyment ofour dog. Be it understood that we were teachers, writers, servants ofcauses, boards, committees, mere professional women, with too littleleisure for the home we loved. Had our hurried days given opportunityfor the fine art of mothering we would have cherished a child insteadof a collie, but Sigurd throve on neglect and saved us from turninginto plaster images by making light of all our serious concerns. Noacademic dignities impressed his happy irreverence."What is Sigurd slinging about there on the lawn?" I asked on his firstCommencement morning. "It looks as if he had a muskrat by the tail."Joy-of-Life glanced apprehensively from the window to the bed, on whichshe had carefully laid out a dean's glistening regalia."My cap!" she ejaculated and dashed downstairs and out of the door andaway over the grass after a frolicsome bandit who knew of no better usefor a mortar-board--perhaps there is none--than to spin it around byits gilt tassel.He had no regard for manuscript, after a thorough investigation hadconvinced him that it was not good to eat, and made no scruple ofbreaking in on our most absorbed moments with an insistent demand forplay. Whatever the game might be, he infused it with dramatic quality,turning every romp into a thrilling adventure. He liked to pretend thathe was Jack the Giant-Killer and would crouch and growl and bristle andfinally hurl himself upon some ogre of a wastepaper basket,overthrowing it in the first onslaught and then worrying its scatteredcontents with mimic fury. For punishment, we would clap the baskettight over his head, and he would back into a corner, indulging in allsorts of profane remarks while he pawed and shook that insulting helmetoff, but carefully, for he clearly understood that, though what it heldwas subject to his teeth, the basket itself must not be harmed. Hepretended to be bitterly outraged by this treatment, but no sooner wasthe basket in position beside the desk again than he would caper up andgleefully knock it over, promptly presenting his ruffled head to havehis punishment repeated.Apart from our enjoyment of his crimes, it was difficult to punish him,because his sunny spirit turned every fresh experience into fun. Hereminded me of a family tradition of an incorrigible baby uncle, whoseclerical father, in despair at the child's ability to find amusementunder all penal circumstances, stripped him naked and shut him into anempty room to repent of his sins. But when the parental eyecondescended to the keyhole, it beheld a rosy cherub with puffed-outcheeks dancing merrily about and blowing a bewildered fly from one endof the chamber to the other.Sigurd loved nothing better than make-believe discipline,--to bewhacked with the feather-duster, "blown away" with the bellows, rolledup in the Sunday newspaper, anything that gave him an excuse forfrisking, barking, dodging, scampering, kicking, rolling, tumbling, andrushing in at the last for a hug of assured understanding. We couldkeep him quiet for hours at a time by putting a cooky or any bit ofsweet into a small pasteboard box, tying it up and fitting it into asmany more, of increasing sizes, as time and material allowed. Sigurdwould watch the process with sparkling eyes and then, taking the packetbetween his forepaws, settle down to the long task of getting at thatcooky. Sometimes he would sigh with weariness or sink his yellow headto the floor in momentary despair. But he never gave up, though heoften paused long enough to restore his energies by a nap. Taking theragged bundle to another part of the room, as if his labors might beassisted by some special quality in a different rug, he would fall uponhis puzzle again and not desist until the goal of all that patientendeavor, one morsel of sweetness, gave its brief delight to histriumphant tongue. This device of the boxes was a great resource whenrough weather kept us in, for the youngster, who did not yet venturefar without us, was incessant in his search for occupation. When thisled him into genuine mischief and brought upon him actual rebuke, hetook it so to heart that no member of the household, in kitchen orstudy, could get on with her work for the next half-day, for Sigurdwould trot from one to another, with imploring eyes, insisting onshaking paws and being forgiven over and over again.A most affectionate little fellow he was, and would sit still at myknee by the hour so long as he was occasionally patted and addressed bywhat he instantly recognized as a pet name,--Opals, or BlessedButtercup, or Honey of Hybla, or Sulphur of my Soul. Epithets failing,he would touch my foot at intervals with a reminding paw. Then,absorbed in my work, I would absent-mindedly, on the edges of myconsciousness, conjure up more titles for him,--Yellowboy, Crocus,Sunflower, Topaz, Mustard, Nugget, Starshine, his appreciative tailthumping the floor at every one. He wanted to be good and was aided bya happy disposition that, when one line of activity was cut off, foundprompt solace in another. After a few trials had convinced him thatbones, though polished in his most masterly manner and disposed behinddoors and under sofa pillows with engaging modesty, were not acceptableornaments of the house, he so rejoiced in the new-found art of buryingthem in the earth that, for a time, all his dainties went the same way,and the gardener's hoe would turn up petrified pieces of sponge cakeand gingerbread at which Sigurd would sniff in embarrassedreminiscence.Day by day the puppy was learning not only the ways of the house, butwhat he considered a proper demeanor toward our variety of callers. Hetook up the domestic routine almost at once and developed such an exactsense of time that we used to call him our four-o'clock. At this merryhour we would drop pens, shut books and take Sigurd to walk,--a dutythat he by no means allowed us to forget. At the exact moment his_Woof, Woof_ rang out like a bell into "the still air of delightfulstudies" and upon his protesting playmates Sigurd would burst like athunderbolt, catching at our dresses and literally dragging us awayfrom our desks. At mealtimes, too, with inexorable punctuality heherded the family to the dining room. But most of the day he was doingsentry duty on the doorsteps, incidentally offering his comment onevery happening of the road and neighborhood. Tramps he abominated and,not content with driving them from our own premises, roared them awayfrom every back door on the hill. His prejudice had to do, apparently,less with their looks and even their smell than with something stealthyand furtive in their approach. Skulking he abhorred. On one occasion hebrought pink confusion to the cheeks of a little seamstress who waspassing in a bundle at the door while her sheepish young escort hid inthe shrubbery. It did not take Sigurd thirty seconds to drive that gawkfrom cover. To a recognized friend our collie would act as master ofceremonies, bounding down the walk to give him welcome, barking sharplyto save him the trouble of ringing the bell, dashing in ahead with theglorious news of the arrival and then scampering back to thrust intothe visitor's palm a cordial, clumsy paw, wagging that plumy tailmeanwhile with an impetuous swing that sometimes swept before it smallarticles from cabinet or tea-table. Sometimes he would take a fancy toan utter stranger and greet him as an angel from the blue, singinglove-at-first-sight to him at the top of his funny squeal, afour-legged troubadour. College girls he regarded as his natural chumsand would frisk about them or leap upon them as the mood took him;middle-aged folk, like his mistresses, were all very well in theirserviceable way; but the romance of life centered for Sigurd in oldladies. The whiter the hair, the more beautiful. For them he wouldspring up on his hind feet and rest his forepaws on their shoulders,pressing his face against their cheeks with such ardor that once, whensuch an encounter occurred on the street, a gentleman rushed fromacross the road, with upraised cane, to the rescue."Kindly let us alone, sir," crisply rebuked the Lovely Object, herbonnet askew but her face beaming. "This dog and I understand eachother and we want no interference."When a company of callers were seated, Sigurd, in a rapture ofhospitality, would hurry again and again around the circle, shakingpaws with each in turn and uttering a continuous, soft quaver ofwelcome, pleasure and pride. Then he would lie down contentedly in thevery center of the group, now and then rolling over on his back in thehope that it would occur to somebody to slap his fluffy breast.At first he often made mistakes in his office of sentinel. It was funnyto see him rush madly to the door at a suspicious step and then,abashed by the jocular greeting of some household familiar, drop ther?le of heroic defender and, waving his tail affably but with a certainreserve, push by on the pretense that he was just coming out to take asquint at the weather.Of sensitive and generous nature, our golden collie was quick to feelthe difference between an intentional hurt and an accident. He had beenwith us only a few weeks when a college colleague, then brightening ourtable with her presence, started to play stick with him before dinner.Sigurd's way of playing stick was to bring you anything from aclothespin to a beanpole and coax you to throw it for him, holding itup lightly between his teeth for you to take. This time he had a pieceof board with jagged ends, and our friend, whose own dog, a monstrouslyugly and therefore supremely choice Boston Bull, would hang on to astick with iron jaws while she tried in vain to wrench it from him,mistook the game. Sigurd held up his stick by one end, deftly balancingit in the air, and she, supposing that he would maintain his grip,rammed it suddenly down his throat. But Sigurd, eager for his run, atonce let go, with the result that his throat was rather badly cut. Hewas surprised into one scream of pain and then silently tore about incircles, his tail low and rigid. His would-be playmate, grieved to theheart, had hurried for his Japanese water-bowl, but Sigurd would touchnothing that she brought. He went, instead, to a natural basin in therock, always his favorite drinking-cup, where he lapped away at aprodigious rate, leaving a red stain on the water. After this he hid inthe bushes, and it was not until dinner was nearly over that Sigurdcame trotting in, ears and tail still depressed. Joy-of-Life, with thevoice that was healing in itself, called him to her, but he passed usboth by, going straight to the comparative stranger who had innocentlyhurt him. Settling on his haunches beside her chair, Sigurd gazed upmournfully but understandingly into her eyes and offered hismagnanimous paw."You know I didn't mean to, and you came in to say so and to forgiveme, you perfect little gentleman," she exclaimed, shaking the profferedpaw as deferentially as if it had been the hand of Socrates. And thatwas the end of it. Sigurd coughed up a little blood and a few splintersthat night, but he always met this lady, on her frequent comings, witha special, quiet courtesy, though he never invited her to a game ofstick again.Sigurd had one playmate who shamefully imposed upon his nobledisposition. Nellie was an ancient spaniel, whose black curls wereturning a dingy gray. She was our next neighbor and Sigurd's firstlove. Nellie was too fat and wheezy to romp, but she would sit,blinking approval, the center of a circle whose circumference was madeby the golden gambols of our infatuated puppy. Around and around her hewould caper, while she yawned and scratched--she was always a vulgarold thing--and took her exercise by proxy. We did not allow Nellieinside the house, to Sigurd's grieved surprise, but his dinner-dish wasregularly set out of doors, by the back steps, and Nellie, every nowand then, when her own rations had not been satisfactory or when Sigurdhad peculiarly toothsome viands on his plate, would take advantage ofhis chivalry to play on him a low-down trick. Out of sight on the otherside of the house, she would raise a wail of feigned distress,whereupon our gallant Volsung, just in the first enjoyment of his food,would lift his head, listen, even drop the piece of meat in his mouthand speed away to her rescue, running down one hill and up another in avain endeavor to discover the villain of whom she had complained.Meanwhile Nellie, puffing with detestable delight, would waddle aroundto the doorsteps and gobble up the best of Sigurd's dinner. When sheheard him bounding back, she discreetly shuffled off, so that Sigurd'sideal remained unspotted. Dear, faithful lad! To the last of herdisgraceful days, he was old Nellie's champion and dupe.All the while his development was going on apace. When he came to us hewas already, like his brothers and sisters, proficient in giving theright paw, and could also, under protest, stand on his hind legs in acorner and "go roly-poly," a senseless performance, that he detested,on floors, but a natural and joyful gymnastic on the grass. He soonadded to these accomplishments the agile arts of jumping over a stickand leaping through a hoop, though his tribulations with the hoop weremany. He would brandish it over his head, run with it and trip in it,get his legs and body all wound up in it, and finally throw himselfupon it and bite it into docility. He readily learned to catch, but histastes were not extravagant and he would disdainfully drop in thethickets the rubber balls that were bought for him and grub up forhimself some crooked branch or tough old chip that suited his purposebetter.Being educators ourselves, we did not think much of education as suchand gave little attention to teaching him artificial tricks.Joy-of-Life was in favor of vocational training and decided that hemust learn to guard. Her efforts nearly achieved success. For one proudfortnight Sigurd would, at the word of command, lie down and, resistingevery temptation to leave his post, watch over a handkerchief or gloveor parasol until he was called off by the same voice that had imposedthe duty on him. It was I who ruined this excellent attainment bysetting him, beside a pansy-bed agleam with sympathetic twinkles, toguard a hoptoad. To Sigurd's dismay and annoyance that brownie of thegarden refused to play the game. How could a puppy remain at his postif his post would not remain at the puppy? Sigurd tried to paw the toadback into place, he remonstrated with it in a series of shrill barksand at last, when he heard us laughing at him, he indignantlyrepudiated, and forever, the whole business of guarding. It was thenthat Joy-of-Life accused me of being a demoralizing influence and forSigurd's good reminded me of what I had quite forgotten and he hadnever known,--that he was not "our puppy" but hers."I want," said Joy-of-Life, bending her earnest look upon us both,"that Sigurd should grow up into a good dog, and how can he be a gooddog if you turn duty into a joke?"I felt so guilty that Sigurd hurried over to lick my hand."Whose dog are you, Gold of Ophir?" I asked, and Sigurd, with animpartial flourish of his tail, lay down exactly between us.This delicate question was ultimately decided by no less an arbiterthan Mother Goose. In pursuance of the theory that her immortalnonsense songs were written by Oliver Goldsmith--this is what is knownas Literary Research--I had obtained leave from a Boston librarian, anindulgent spirit now gone to his reward, to take home for comparisonwith an accumulation of other texts a unique copy, exquisitely printedon creamy pages with wide margins and choicely bound in white and gold.It was an extraordinary grace of permission and, even in the act ofpassing that gem of a volume over, the librarian hesitated."It must not come to harm," he said, "for it is irreplaceable; but Iknow how you value books and I believe there are no children, to whomthis might be a temptation, under your roof.""Unfortunately, no; only a puppy.""We will risk the puppy," he smiled,--but he did not know Sigurd.I carried that book home as carefully as if it had been a nest ofhumming-bird's eggs. As I used it that evening at my desk, I propped itup at a far distance from any possible spatter of ink. Then I slippedit into a vacant space on the shelf of the revolving bookcase close athand and, resolving to return it the next morning, turned to agood-night romp with the Volsung. We tried several new games withoutwinning much popular applause. He was a failure as Wolf at the Door,because he barked so gleefully for admittance to the room whereJoy-of-Life was brushing her mother's beautiful white hair and was sowelcome when he came bursting in; nor did he shine as Mother Hubbard'sdog, for his friend in the kitchen, Cecilia, who never let her cupboardgo bare, had just filled the doughnut jar. So we practiced in secretfor a few minutes on "a poetic recital" of Hickory Dickory Dock andthen came forth to electrify the household. Taking a central seat, Irepeated those talismanic syllables, at whose sound Sigurd jumped uponme, climbed up till his forepaws rested on the high top of the chair,in graphic illustration of the way the mouse ran up the clock, emittedan explosive bark when, shifting parts at a sudden pinch, he became foran instant the clock striking one, and then scrambled down withalacrity, a motion picture of the retreating mouse. This was no smallintellectual exercise for a collie, and at the end of our one and onlypublic performance he broke away and squeezed himself under the sofa,where he lay rubbing his poor, overwrought noddle against the coolestspot on the wall.His mental energies had revived by morning and apparently he wanted toreview his _Hickory Dickory Dock_, for he was in my study earlier thanI and there, from all the rows of books on all the open shelves, hemust needs pick out _Mother Goose_, even that unique copy _de luxe_.When I came in, there was Sigurd outstretched on his favorite rug,beside my desk, with the book between his forepaws, ecstaticallyengaged in chewing off one corner.My gasp of horror brought Joy-of-Life speedily to the scene, andSigurd, instantly aware that he had committed a transgression beyondprecedent, slid unobtrusively away, his penitent tail tucked betweenhis legs. We were too keenly concerned over the injury done to rememberto punish him, but no further punishment than our obvious distress wasneeded. Never again would Sigurd touch a book or anything resembling abook. He had discovered, once for all, that he had no taste forliterature."What can you do?" asked Joy-of-Life, distractedly trying to wipe thatpulpy corner dry with her napkin. "This rich binding is ruined, but themargins are so broad that Sigurd--O _Sigurd_!--has not quite chewedthrough to the print.""Nothing but make confession in sackcloth and ashes and pay what I haveto pay," I answered gloomily. Then a wicked impulse prompted me to add:"Of course, since it's _your_ dog that has done the damage----""Sigurd is _our_ dog," hastily interposed Joy-of-Life. "I give you halfof him here and now, and we'll divide the damage."So as I went in to inflict this shock upon the kind librarian I was notwithout a certain selfish consolation, for if I should have to pay overall my bank account, I would be getting my money's worth. The librarianbent his brows over that mangled volume, listened severely to my abjectnarration and not until his eye-glasses hopped off his nose did Irealize that he was convulsed with laughter."What can I do?" I asked, too deeply contrite to resent his mirth.He wiped his eyes, replaced his glasses, examined the book once more."Well!" he replied in a choking voice. "If it were possible to replacethis volume, I should have to require you to do so at whatever cost.But there is no other copy to be had. Its ?sthetic value is gone beyondrepair. The text, fortunately, is intact. We shall have to cut thepages down to the print and bind them into plain covers. A pity, but itcan't be helped. The circumstances do not seem to call for a fine, butthe rebinding will cost you, I regret to say, twenty-five cents."Choosing to deal generously with Joy-of-Life, I paid it all.Although Sigurd's golden coat seemed but the outer shining of thegladness that possessed him, he had his share of the ills that flesh isheir to, the most serious being a well-nigh fatal attack of distemper.With human obtuseness, we did not realize at first that our collie wassick. We heard him making strangling sounds and thought he hadswallowed too big a piece of bone. We started out, that Sundayafternoon, on a seven-mile walk, partly for the purpose of exercisingSigurd, and were a bit hurt by his most unwonted lack of enthusiasm.Instead of multiplying the miles by his usual process of racing inerratic circles around and around us and dashing off on far excursionsover the fields on either side, he trotted soberly at heel, like thewell-trained dog he never was. He moped, tail hanging, ears depressed,and soon began to fall behind. At the halfway turn he lay down and, fora time, flatly refused to budge. We laughed at his new game of Lazy Dogand relentlessly whistled him along. We were almost home, having passedthrough the village square, Sigurd lagging far in the rear, when anotorious bloodhound, out for his weekly constitutional, broke awayfrom the steel chain by which his master was holding him and charged onour big puppy. Sigurd ran for his life, but the fleeter hound was closeupon him. There were knots of men loafing about the square and, waitingfor the next trolley car, there stood among them an old dame gaylyattired in the colors of her native Erin. Sigurd's limited range ofexperience had led him to regard men either as secondary creatures whodid what they were bid by the all-potent Lady of Cedar Hill or asparlor and piazza, ornaments enveloped in an unpleasant odor oftobacco. His peril called for strong protection, so, as we were stilltoo distant, he took refuge behind the voluminous sea-green skirts ofthat decent Irish body and, dodging skillfully as she twirled andwhirled, kept her as a buffer between himself and his enemy. Screechingto all the saints for deliverance, she was still striving in vain toescape from her awful position, when the owners of the dogs camepanting up. The bloodhound's master collared him, none too soon, andbeat him so savagely with the chain that we turned away from the sightto sympathize with Sigurd's involuntary defender and help her adjusther grass-green bonnet and veil. As for Sigurd, he had flashed out ofthe picture, but we found him at home, lying inert, exhausted, refusingwater and biscuit, indifferent to bones. He sniffed regretfully at hisSunday dinner, but left it untasted.An hour or two before dawn, simultaneously awakened by the sound ofdesperate coughing, Joy-of-Life and I met on the stairs and hurrieddown to find a croupy puppy, who, in his emergency, had again bittenhis leash in two and climbed into his favorite--because forbidden--easychair. As we leaned over him, Sigurd put up a paw to each of us, hissuffering eyes expectant of relief. But we could devise no effectualhelp, and the veterinary, called in as early as we dared, regarded theinvalid as a dangerous animal and handled him so roughly that, themoment Sigurd found himself released, he slipped out of the house andacross the road to Nellie. Sorely disappointed in us, he tried to hidehis yellow towering bulk on the other side of that grizzled littlespaniel and waited, an exile from home, until the doctor had drivenaway.For weeks we had a sick collie on our hands. He dreaded food and wouldsqueeze himself into all impossible places when he saw either one of uscoming with the prescribed "nourishment." As for medicine, hecontracted that autumn an aversion to bottles which he never overcame.Years afterward, if Sigurd, about to enter a room, stopped short on thethreshold and turned abruptly away, we looked around for the bottle.One morning the gasps were very feeble. The veterinary told us the endwas at hand. We took our earth-loving collie out from his darkhospital-nook in the house and laid him down among the asters andgoldenrods on the wild land at the rear. The Lady of Cedar Hill hadcome over to see him once more. He was lying so still that we thoughthe would not move again, but at the sound of that beloved voice Sigurdstirred a feeble tail and breathed a ghostly echo of his lyric cry.Faint and hoarse though it was, there was the old glad recognition init, and his first mistress, forgetting her intended precautions for thedogs at home, knelt down beside her Njal, comforting him with tenderstrokes and soft, caressing words. From that hour he began to mend, butso slowly that we were anxious about him all winter. Cruel pains wouldsuddenly dart through him and he could never understand where they camefrom nor who did it. We would hear the sharp, distinctive cry thatmeant one of those pangs and then see Sigurd stagger up from his rug orcushion, look at it with deep reproach and cross to the furthest cornerof the room. Once such a shoot of pain took him as he was standing byJoy-of-Life's gentle mother, his head propped on her knee, and the airof incredulous grief with which he drew back and gazed at her smote herto the soul. It was a matter of days before he could be coaxed to cometo her again.One of the discoveries of Sigurd's illness was the heart of our Swedishmaid, Cecilia. Fresh from Ellis Island, buxom, comely, neat as ascoured rolling-pin, she regarded us with no more feeling than did hermolding-board. We introduced her to the ways of an American household;we helped her with the speaking of English; we paid her wages; we were,in short, her Plymouth Rock, on which she stepped to her career in theNew World. Best of all, we were palates and stomachs on which to tryher sugary experiments, for it was her steadfast ambition to become anartist in dough with the view of securing a lucrative position as apastry cook. However much we might further her own interests, herimperturbable coolness made it clear that as fellow-creatures we werenothing, but she humored every whim of that sick puppy, even lettinghim lie in her immaculate pantry when the restless fancy took him. Herlove was lasting, too, for although, as soon as we had suffered herapprenticeship and begun to enjoy her perfected craft, she ruthlesslyleft us for "a hotel yob," she persisted for several years in sendingSigurd a dog-picture postcard every Christmas. We always gave him thecards, telling him they came from his friend Cecilia, and he pawed thempolitely, but inwardly deemed them a poor substitute for the cakes,tarts, puffs and crinkle-pastes of many curious flavors that had, forone brief season, made our At Homes famous in our "little academe,"dropping delicious flakes for a thrifty tongue to garner under thetable.The distemper finally passed off in a trailing effect of St. Vitus'dance, which, again, our afflicted collie could not understand. On ourspringtide walks, his head, as he trotted in front, would suddenly betwitched to one side, as if we had jerked it by a rein. Apparently hethought we had, for invariably he came running back to see what wewanted of Sigurd.The final, enduring result of this hard experience was an assureddevotion. Sigurd had genially accepted us from the first as his people,but now, through the suffering and weakness, he had come to know us ashis very own. The lyric cry still belonged to high romance, but afterall those piteous weeks when he found his only comfort in lying closebeside our feet--even, in extremity, upon them--he reserved certainwelcomes and caresses for us alone. Ours was the long, silent pressureof the golden head against the knee and, in time of trouble, the swifttouch of the tongue upon clouded faces, and ours the long, shining,intimate gaze that poured forth imperishable loyalty and love.LADDIE    Lowly the soul that waits    At the white, celestial gates,    A threshold soul to greet    Belov?d feet.    Down the streets that are beams of sun    Cherubim children run;    They welcome it from the wall;    Their voices call.    But the Warder saith: "Nay, this    Is the City of Holy Bliss.    What claim canst thou make good    To angelhood?"    "Joy," answereth it from eyes    That are amber ecstasies,    Listening, alert, elate,    Before the gate.        _Oh, how the frolic feet        On lonely memory beat!        What rapture in a run        'Twixt snow and sun!_    "Nay, brother of the sod,    What part hast thou in God?    What spirit art thou of?"    It answers: "Love,"    Lifting its head, no less    Cajoling a caress,    Our winsome collie wraith,    Than in glad faith    The door will open wide,    Or kind voice bid: "Abide,    A threshold soul to greet    The longed-for feet."        _Ah, Keeper of the Portal,        If Love be not immortal,        If Joy be not divine,        What prayer is mine?_THE CALL OF THE BLOOD    "Come, brother; away!"    --Shakespeare's _Much Ado About Nothing_.Sigurd was not the only representative of his family in our favoredtown. His sister Hildigunna, who might well be described in the wordsapplied to Hildigunna of the saga as "one of the fairest," was givento a comparatively remote household in Wellesley Hills fromwhich--alas!--she soon was stolen and spirited away to fates unknown.But his brother Hrut, a name speedily changed by his new owners toLaddie, took up his happy abode at The Orchard, not half a mile fromus. These owners, returning from one of their many holidays abroad,had found on shipboard the Lady of Cedar Hill, on her way back fromNorway. Of course she told them about the ten puppies and of courseshe promised them one.Reared in the best traditions of New England, these travelers hadalready achieved an ideal success as founders and directors of a famousschool for girls and had retired from active labors to a tranquil homewhose broad Colonial porches were screened with "white foam flowers" ofthe clematis. They were Neighbors _par excellence_, so beloved, soleaned upon, so beset with callers and "old girls," with churchcommittees and town committees, with causes and confidences, that theyliterally had to go to Europe to secure an occasional rest. And it wascharming to see how their modest dignity and winsome graciousnessreceived due meed of honor the Old World over, from titled personagesof London to the very cab-drivers of Florence, whom they believed to be"honorable men" and were undoubtedly cheated less for so believing.Hard, shrewd faces of Paris pensions and Swiss hotels softened in theirpresence, and even the severe old Scotch dame who rated them roundlyfor gadding about the globe instead of having married and reared afreckled family, like hers, was moved to add: "But I mak nae doobt yeare mooch respectet where ye cam fram." She would have been confirmedin this amiable concession if she could have seen how their return wasa village jubilee and how all our accumulated joys and sorrows troopedin at once through their open doors. They were Ladies of rare andprecious quality, with a touch of precise, old-fashioned elegance,which made one frank admirer exclaim: "But they are like finest china,like porcelain, like _S?vres_. There is nothing so exquisite left onearth. They are classics." Most eminently of all, they were Sisters. Achildhood of strange peril and suffering, in which their hearts clungso close together that they grew into one, had fitted naturallydissimilar natures into an utter harmony of desire and deed. Nobodyever thought of one without the other. Not Castor and Pollux shine witha more closely related and serener light.The Sisters hardly waited for our first tumult of greetings to subsidebefore, on a September afternoon as quietly radiant as their own faces,they drove over to Cedar Hill to see what they described as "ten littlefluffy balls, only just large enough to wriggle." The choice of theircollie they left to the giver. It was not determined then, but early inApril they had a message setting the day on which they were to "comefor Hrut." I presume they kissed the telephone. At all events, theywent with glad alacrity. As the door opened to admit them, a beautifullittle collie, pure white save for touches of a rich golden brown onthe ears, on the fall of the tail and on the top of his nobly carriedhead, ran to meet them and sprang into the outstretched arms of theforemost, cuddling there as if he knew that he had found his EarthlyParadise.His mistress had followed directly after him, aglow with pride in thegrace of his welcome."But this one cannot be ours,--he is _too_ lovely," exclaimed theSister who was already clasping him tight."Yes," smiled the Lady of Cedar Hill, "this one is yours," and thepuppy acquiesced with wagging tail and lapping tongue and every colliecourtesy.From the first a delicate little fellow, the long drive back made himill, but he never gave, then or later, the least sign of homesickness,settling at once with aristocratic ease into the comforts andprivileges of his new environment and lavishly returning love for love.The Sisters, as well as the elder Cousin who dwelt with them, were"lovers of all things alive," from bishops and other dignitaries, whopaid them appreciative homage, to the South Sea Islanders, of whosecostumes they disapproved but to whom, from babyhood up, they hadhelped send missionaries. The grimiest urchin in town would grinconfidentially as he touched his cap to them, and their sympathyoverflowed all local limits to childhood everywhere. Little crippleswere the special objects of their care and tenderness. Of birds andbeasts they were spirited champions. No man dared whip his horse ifthey were in sight. One of the Sisters had a magic pen, and many of herstories, whimsical and wise, carried an appeal for human gratitudetoward the domestic animals who spend their patient strength in humanservice, and for friendliness toward all these sensitivefellow-creatures, our brief companions on a whirling star. Thequadrupeds must have passed on from one to another the glad tidings ofthese Ladies of Lovingkindness, for many a hungry and thirsty cursought the hospitalities of their kitchen, and stray cats, forsaken byselfish owners on vacation, used their piazza and even their parlor asa summer hotel. Early one July morning I was starting out for thecollege grounds on the search for a wretched mongrel that, havingappeared from nowhere in the spring term, as dogs will, had become acheerful hobo of the campus, living sumptuously through unlimitedattendance on the out-of-door luncheon parties of the village students.A Commencement auto had broken one of his legs and frightened him intohiding, and now the ebb of all that girl life which had fed and pettedhim and the disappearance of chance bones from the closed back doors ofthe dormitories had brought upon the college, I was informed by specialdelivery letter from an indignant alumna, "the disgrace of leaving oneof God's creatures to suffer slow starvation." Old experience led me,before setting forth to the rescue, to telephone the Sisters and ask ifthey had any news of this divine vagabond."Yes, indeed," rang back a cheery voice. "He is breakfasting with usnow on the porch. He came limping up the walk just as the bell rang,exactly as if he had been invited. Such a pleasant dog in his manners,though dreadfully thin and--it's not his fault, poor dear--_so_ dirty!I have just been calling Dr. Vet. to come and see what can be done forthat poor leg."Of course Laddie was not their first dog. The checks of the school arestill stamped with the head of Don, their black Newfoundland, who had apassion for attending the morning service in the school hall andnipping the heels of the kneeling girls. In the repeating of the Lord'sPrayer he would join with a subdued rumble, doubtless acceptable to hisCreator, but when shut out from the sacred exercises, he would howlunder the windows an anthem of his own that offended both Heaven andearth.In the inexorable process of the years, Don grew old, becoming a veryUncle Roly-Poly, but he was only loved the more. A cherished legend ofthe school relates how he was sleeping on his rug by the bed of one ofhis mistresses on a winter night, dreaming a saintly dream of chasingcats out of Paradise, when some real or fancied noise awoke him and,the faithful guardian of the school, he rushed through the low, openwindow and out upon the piazza roof, barking his thunderous warning toall trespassers. But he was still so bewildered with sleep that hislegs ran faster than his mind and, before he knew it, he had pitchedoff the edge of that icy roof and was floundering in the snow beneath,the most astonished dog that ever bayed the moon. What happened to himthen is supposed to have been related by Don himself:    "My howls dismayed the starry skies,      The Great and Little Dippers, _O!_    Till came an angel in disguise,      In dressing gown and slippers, _O!_    I staggered up the steepy stair;      She pushed me from behind, _Bow wow!_    She tended me with mickle care,      O winsome womankind! _Bow wow!_    She bathed my brow and bruis?d knee.      I only whined the louder, _O!_    She murmured: 'Homeopathy!      I'll give dear Don a powder,' _O!_    And may I be a pink-eyed rabbit      If she chose not from her stock, _Bow wow!_    FOR PERSONS OF A GOUTY HABIT      WHO'VE HAD A NERVOUS SHOCK. _Bow wow!_"Other dogs had come after, notably Cardigan, a stately St. Bernard, whomade the fatal mistake of biting a pacifist, but Laddie, the only realrival of Don in the Sisters' affections, was the crown of their delightin doghood.Sigurd had been with us only a few days when we took him over to seehis brother, already for nearly three months a resident at The Orchard.We found Laddie, slender, white and dainty, quite at home on theluxurious drawing-room sofa."I'm stronger than you," growled Sigurd, but Laddie, always thegentlest and sweetest tempered of collies, acquiesced so pleasantlythat it was an amicable meeting. At the first hint of a second growl,Laddie gave up the place of honor to his guest.Of course we remonstrated, admonished Sigurd and urged theaccommodating host, whose good manners delighted the Sisters, to jumpback, which he did, tucking himself unobtrusively into the furthercorner of the sofa. Sigurd immediately claimed that corner, whichLaddie yielded to him with unruffled magnanimity, crossing over to theother. Sigurd promptly changed his mind again, pushing Laddie, thistime a little inclined to demur, down to the floor. Unable to devise aplan by which he could curl into both corners at once, Sigurd stretchedhimself out at full length, doing his best to reach from end to end ofthe sofa, while Laddie, closely copying the attitude of this arrogantbig brother, lay along the rug below. Scandalized by Sigurd's conduct,we would have removed him from his usurped throne in short order, butthe Sisters, rejoicing in the perfection of Laddie's social graces andsecretly convinced of their collie's moral superiority to ours, wouldnot allow any interference with the visiting puppy's comfort.That freedom of the sofa was precious to Sigurd's pride and by repeatedefforts he tried to convince his obtuse mistresses that he was entitledto the same privilege at home. But Joy-of-Life, who did not believe in"pampering pets," stood firm. There was one evening, in particular,when Sigurd jumped up on our living-room lounge some score of times,keeping all the while a challenging eye on her, and just as many timeswas ignominiously tumbled off. When she finally took possessionherself, laughing at his discomfiture, he banged his way out into thekitchen and went down with a thump on the bare floor, hoping that wewould hear how hard it was and realize how sorely poor Sigurd wasabused. Finding that no apologies were forthcoming, he bounded to thefront door, barked his orders to have it opened and shot out into thedark. Within five minutes the familiar tinkle called us to thetelephone and over the wire flowed the blithe voice of one of theSisters."I _must_ tell you what a lovely call we are having from dear Sigurd.He barked to come in only a minute ago and went right up to the sofaand took it all for himself--oh, yes, our Cousin had been sitting therewith Laddie, but they didn't mind at all--and there he is now, makinghimself so charmingly at home, the beautiful boy. I _do_ wish youcould see him.""_We will_," responded Joy-of-Life, and off we started to chastiseYoung Impudence, whom we had begun to suspect of being a trifleself-willed; but when we arrived the Sisters would by no means consentto his overthrow. So there, while the chat went on, Sigurd lolled andsprawled, yawning, stretching himself to an incredible length, rollingover on his back with paws held high as if to applaud his victory andcontinually turning up to Joy-of-Life eyes of such sparkling glee thather purposes of discipline melted in mirth.None the less, she was a match for him, resorting to strategy when shewas forbidden the exercise of force. Calling Laddie to her, she beganto stroke his nestling head. Instantly Sigurd, with a multitudinousflourish of legs that might have moved a centipede to envy, flunghimself off the sofa and roared imperiously at the front door:"Open this, Somebody, and be quick about it, too. Time to be off. Oh,come along, Folks. You've no need to pat any dog but me. Good-night,Lovely Ladies. S'long, Lad. See you tomorrow in the gloaming."And unless we kept a strict watch, so he would. How often, whilesurveying from our west porch, with Sigurd demurely sitting up betweenus, the last faint flushes of the sunset sky, from across the roadthere would be suddenly visible against the dusk a presence like acelestial apparition, so white and hushed it was, the shining figure,the lifted, listening head! And in the fraction of a second, even whilewe were catching at his collar, off would go Sigurd with a great leap,and away the brother collies would tear on a mighty run that kept twohouseholds anxious far into the night. There was nothing celestialabout their behavior.These lawless excursions often culminated in garbage-pail raids,debauches from which the young prodigals would sneak home, abashed withnausea. Once in a Commencement season we returned late in the evening,with a guest, from the high solemnity of the President's Reception, tofind our hall strewn with Jonah strips of ham-rind and junks ofpumpkin. Our guest was a brilliant, worldly being, a very dragon-fly ofswiftness and gleam, and there she stood, exquisitely gowned inrose-red under lace whose color was that of moonlight seen through thinclouds, beholding our culprit, who an hour before had been exultantlyranging a world of mysterious and infinite adventure, flattenedcontritely in the midst of his enormities."How human!" was her only comment.Often they came back injured, with bitten ears, scratched faces,bleeding feet, and pretended to be worse off than they were, so as todivert our reproaches into pity. Sigurd limped home one dawn with acruelly torn claw and lay all day in a round clothes-basket, to whichhe had taken a fancy, curled up like a yellow caterpillar and sleepinglike a dormouse. But when I was sitting on the piazza steps thatevening, putting a fresh bandage on the claw, while Sigurd, almost toofeeble to stir, watched the process with pathetic eyes, a blanchedsprite glistened by, only a white motion through the dark, and in aninstant the invalid had sped away, bandage trailing, to be wicked allover again.No matter how often the four mistresses agreed that discipline requireddoors to be shut against the truants till daybreak, on these nights oftheir escapes ours were light slumbers that a pleading whine too easilybroke and many were the tiptoe journeys down derisively creaking stairsto let the wanderers in. The next day such lame, dirty, subdued,meek-minded stay-at-homes as our collies were! It was hard to scoldthem properly when they rolled over on their backs and presented achingstomachs to be comforted. But sometimes these stampedes took place byday, for whenever they met out-of-doors these brothers, otherwisefairly obedient, would disregard all human commands for theauthoritative call of the blood and dart away side by side like arrowsshot from a single bow. The sins that neither would commit alone theyreveled in without scruple when they were together. From all over townwe heard of our paragons as chasing cats, jumping at horses' heads,over-running gardens and upsetting children. One sedate young woman onwhom they leaped, entreating her to play with them, sent in asubstantial bill to "the owner of the dog that tore my dress." When weinquired whether it was the golden collie or the white that did thedamage she coldly replied that "the animals were so mixed up" shecouldn't tell whether it was "the brown one or the drab,"--to such acondition had a bath of mud brought our dandies. One mother sternlyconfronted us with a weepy little boy who complained that "zem two dogsmade me frow sticks for 'em all the way home from school
