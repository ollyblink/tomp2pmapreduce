ntences,often with glosses, original and selected, between them. To thecommentary there succeeds a paraphrase, which is not copied bythe author from those of his predecessors. After the paraphrasewe have Explanations (??). The book is beautifully printed, and insmall type, so that it is really a multum in parvo, withconsiderable freshness.	?????|??q??, 'A Paraphrase for Daily Lessons, Explaining theMeaning of the Four Books.' This work was produced in 1677, by adepartment of the members of the Han-lin college, in obedience toan imperial rescript. The paraphrase is full, perspicuous, andelegant.	?s?s?P????; ??g????J?; ??g????J?; §?O?q??; ?K?????J?.These works form together a superb edition of the Five Ching,published by imperial authorityin the K'ang-hsi and Yung-chang reigns. They contain the standardviews (??); various opinions (??); critical decisions of the editors(??) ; prolegomena; plates or cuts; and other apparatus for thestudent.	???e???????, 'The Collected Writings of Mao Hsi-ho.' Seeprolegomena, p. 20. The voluminousness of his Writings isunderstated there. Of ?g??, or Writings on the Classics, there are236 sections, while his ??, or other literary compositions,amount to 257 sections. His treatises on the Great Learning andthe Doctrine of the Mean have been especially helpful to me. He isa great opponent of Chu Hsi, and would be a much more effectiveone, if he possessed the same graces of style as that 'prince ofliterature.'	?|???l??, 'A Collection of Supplemental Observations onthe Four Books.' The preface of the author, Ts'ao Chih-shang (????), is dated in 1795, the last year of the reign of Ch'ien-lung. Thework contains what we may call prolegomena on each of the FourBooks, and then excursus on the most difficult and disputedpassages. The tone is moderate, and the learning displayedextensive and solid. The views of Chu Hsi are frequently welldefended from the assaults of Mao Hsi-ho. I have found the Workvery instructive.	?m????, 'On the Tenth Book of the Analects, with Plates.'This Work was published by the author, Chiang Yung (????), in thetwenty-first Ch'ien-lung year, A.D. 1761, when he was seventy-six years old. It is devoted to the illustration of the above portionof the Analects, and is divided into ten sections, the first ofwhich consists of woodcuts and tables. The second contains theLife of Confucius, of which I have largely availed myself in thepreceding chapter. The whole is a remarkable specimen of theminute care with which Chinese scholars have illustrated theClassical Books	?|?????a; ?|?????a??; ?|?????a?S??; ?|?????a?T??. We may callthese volumes-- 'The Topography of the Four Books; with threeSupplements.' The Author's name is Yen Zo-ch'u (?F?Y??). The firstvolume was published in 1698, and the second in 1700. I have notbeen able to find the dates of publication of the other two, inwhich there is more biographical and general matter thantopographical. The author apologizes for the inappropriateness oftheir titles by saying that he could nothelp calling them Supplements to the Topography, which was his'first love.'	??M?g??, 'Explanations of the Classics, under the ImperialTs'ing Dynasty.' See above, p. 20. The Work, however, was notpublished, as I have there supposed, by imperial authority, butunder the superintendence, and at the expense (aided by otherofficers), of Yuan Yuan (????), Governor-general of Kwang-tungand Kwang-hsi, in the ninth year of the last reign, 1829. Thepublication of so extensive a Work shows a public spirit and zealfor literature among the high officers of China, which should keepforeigners from thinking meanly of them.	??l?a?y, 'Sayings of the Confucian Family.' Family is to betaken in the sense of Sect or School. In Liu Hsin's Catalogue, inthe subdivision devoted to the Lun Yu, we find the entry:--'Sayings of the Confucian Family, twenty-seven Books,' with anote by Yen Sze-ku of the T'ang dynasty,-- 'Not the existing Workcalled the Family Sayings.' The original Work was among thetreasures found in the wall of Confucius's old house, and wasdeciphered and edited by K'ung An-kwo. The present Work is byWang Su of the Wei (?Q) dynasty, grounded professedly on theolder one, the blocks of which had suffered great dilapidationduring the intervening centuries. It is allowed also, that, sinceSu's time, the Work has suffered more than any of theacknowledged Classics. Yet it is a very valuable fragment ofantiquity, and it would be worth while to incorporate it with theAnalects. My copy is the edition of Li Yung (???e), published in1780. I have generally called the Work 'Narratives of the School.'	?t?q??????, 'Sacrificial Canon of the Sage's Temples, withPlates.' This Work, published in 1826, by Ku Yuan, styled Hsiang-chau (?U?J, ?r???), is a very painstaking account of all the Namessacrificed to in the temples of Confucius, the dates of theirattaining to that honour, &c. There are appended to it Memoirs ofConfucius and Mencius, which are not of so much value.	?Q?l????, 'The Complete Works of the Ten Tsze.' SeeMorrison's Dictionary, under the character ?l. I have only hadoccasion, in connexion with this Work, to refer to the writings ofChwang-tsze (???l) and Lieh-tsze (?C?l). My copy is an edition of1804.	???N?W??C?k??m??, 'A Cyclopaeia of Surnames, orBiographical Dictionary, of the Famous Men and Virtuous Womenof the Successive Dynasties.' This is a very notable work of itsclass; published in 1793, by ?????~, and extending through 157chapters or Books.	???m?q??, 'General Examination of Records and Scholars.' Thisastonishing Work, which cost its author, Ma Twan-lin (?????{),twenty years' labour, was first published in 1321. Remusat says,-- 'This excellent Work is a library in itself, and if Chineseliterature possessed no other, the language would be worthlearning for the sake of reading this alone.' It does indeed displayall but incredible research into every subject connected with theGovernment, History, Literature, Religion, &c., of the empire ofChina. The author's researches are digested in 348 Books. I havehad occasion to consult principally those on the LiteraryMonuments, embraced in seventy-six Books, from the 174th to the249th.	???U?L?g?q??, 'An Examination of the Commentaries on theClassics,' by Chu I-tsun. The author was a member of the Han-lincollege, and the work was first published with an imperialpreface by the Ch'ien-lung emperor. It is an exhaustive work onthe literature of the Classics, in 300 chapters or Books.'	????m?q??, 'A Continuation of the General Examination ofRecords and Scholars.' This Work, which is in 254 Books, andnearly as extensive as the former, was the production of WangCh'i (????), who dates his preface in 1586, the fourteenth year ofWan-li, the style of the reign of the fourteenth emperor of theMing dynasty. Wang Ch'i brings down the Work of his predecessorto his own times. He also frequently goes over the same ground,and puts things in a clearer light. I have found this to be the casein the chapters on the classical and other Books.	?G?Q?|?v, 'The Twenty-four Histories.' These are theimperially-authorized records of the empire, commencing withthe 'Historical Records,' the work of Sze-ma Ch'ien, and endingwith the History of the Ming dynasty, which appeared in 1742, theresult of the joint labours of 145 officers and scholars of thepresent dynasty. The extent of the collection may be understoodfrom this, that my copy, bound in English fashion, makes sixty-three volumes, each one larger than this. No nation has a historyso thoroughly digested; and on the whole it is trustworthy. In pre-paring this volume, my necessities have been confined mostly tothe Works of Sze-ma Ch'ien, and his successor, Pan Ku (?Z?T), theHistorian of the first Han dynasty.	???N??O??, 'The Annals of the Nation.' Published by imperialauthority in 1803, the eighth year of Ch'ia-ch'ing. This Work isinvaluable to a student, being, indeed, a collection ofchronological tables, where every year, from the rise of the Chaudynasty, B.C. 1121, has a distinct column to itself, in which, indifferent compartments, the most important events are noted.Beyond that date, it ascends to nearly the commencement of thecycles in the sixty-first year of Hwang-ti, giving -- not everyyear, but the years of which anything has been mentioned inhistory. From Hwang-ti also, it ascends through the dateless agesup to P'an-ku, the first of mortal sovereigns.	???Næ???, 'The Boundaries of the Nation in the successiveDynasties.' This Work by the same author, and published in 1817,does for the boundaries of the empire the same service which thepreceding renders to its chronology.	???N?u????, 'The Topography of the Nation in the successiveDynasties.' Another Work by the same author, and of the same dateas the preceding.___________________________	The Dictionaries chiefly consulted have been:--	The well-known Shwo Wan (?????r), by Hsu Shan, styledShu-chung (?\?V, ?r????), published in A.D. 100; with thesupplement (ô??) by Hsu Ch'ieh (?}??), of the southern Tangdynasty. The characters are arranged in the Shwo Wan under 540keys or radicals, as they are unfortunately termed.	The Liu Shu Ku (????G), by Tai T'ung, styled Chung-ta (???,?r??F), of our thirteenth century. The characters are arranged init, somewhat after the fashion of the R Ya (p. 2), under six generaldivisions, which again are subdivided, according to the affinity ofsubjects, into various categories.	The Tsze Hui (?r?J), which appeared in the Wan-li (?U??)reign of the Ming dynasty (1573-1619). The 540 radicals of theShwo Wan were reduced in this to 214, at which number they havesince continued.	The K'ang-hsi Tsze Tien (?d???r??), or Kang-hsi Dictionary,prepared by order of the great K'ang-hsi emperor in 1716. Thisis the most common and complete of all Chinese dictionaries forcommon use.	The I Wan Pi Lan (?Z?????), 'A Complete Exhibition of all theAuthorized Characters,' published in 1787; 'furnishing,' says Dr.Williams, 'good definitions of all the common characters, whoseancient forms are explained.'	The Pei Wan Yun Fu (???????), generally known amongforeigners as 'The Kang-hsi Thesaurus.' It was undertaken by animperial order, and published in 1711, being probably, as Wyliesays, 'the most extensive work of a lexicographical characterever produced.' It does for the phraseology of Chinese literatureall, and more than all, that the Kang-hsi dictionary does for theindividual characters. The arrangement of the characters isaccording to their tones and final sounds. My copy of it, with asupplement published about ten years later, is in forty-five largevolumes, with much more letter-press in it than the edition ofthe Dynastic Histories mentioned on p. 133.	The Ching Tsi Tswan Ku, ping Pu Wei (?g?y??(??W?W?U)???}???), 'A Digest of the Meanings in the Classical and other Books,with Supplement,' by, or rather under the superintendence of, YuanYuan (p. 132). This has often been found useful. It is arrangedaccording to the tones and rhymes like the characters in theThesaurus.SECTION II.TRANSLATIONS AND OTHER WORKS.

High on the world did our fathers of old,        Under the stars and stripes,    Blazon the name that we now must uphold,        Under the stars and stripes.    Vast in the past they have builded an arch    Over which Freedom has lighted her torch.    Follow it! Follow it! Come, let us march        Under the stars and stripes!    We in whose bodies the blood of them runs,        Under the stars and stripes,    We will acquit us as sons of their sons,        Under the stars and stripes.    Ever for justice, our heel upon wrong,    We in the light of our vengeance thrice strong!    Rally together! Come tramping along        Under the stars and stripes!    Out of our strength and a nation's great need,        Under the stars and stripes,    Heroes again as of old we shall breed,        Under the stars and stripes.    Broad to the winds be our banner unfurled!    Straight in Spain's face let defiance be hurled!    God on our side, we will battle the world        Under the stars and stripes!                                  MADISON CAWEIN.

Day after Day, young with eternal beauty,    Pays flowery duty to the month and clime;    Night after night erects a vasty portal    Of stars immortal for the march of Time.    But where are now the Glory and the Rapture,    That once did capture me in cloud and stream?    Where now the Joy that was both speech and silence?    Where the beguilance that was fact and dream?    I know that Earth and Heaven are as golden    As they of olden made me feel and see;    Not in themselves is lacking aught of power    Through star and flower--something's lost in me.    _Return! Return!_ I cry, _O Visions vanished,    O Voices banished, to my Soul again!_--    The near Earth blossoms and the far Skies glisten,    I look and listen, but, alas! in vain._August._I    Clad on with glowing beauty and the peace,      Benign, of calm maturity, she stands      Among her meadows and her orchard-lands,    And on her mellowing gardens and her trees,      Out of the ripe abundance of her hands,                  Bestows increase    And fruitfulness, as, wrapped in sunny ease,                Blue-eyed and blonde she goes,    Upon her bosom _Summer's_ richest rose.II    And he who follows where her footsteps lead,      By hill and rock, by forest-side and stream,      Shall glimpse the glory of her visible dream,    In flower and fruit, in rounded nut and seed:      She in whose path the very shadows gleam;                  Whose humblest weed    Seems lovelier than _June's_ loveliest flower, indeed,                And sweeter to the smell    Than _April's_ self within a rainy dell.III    Hers is a sumptuous simplicity      Within the fair Republic of her flowers,      Where you may see her standing hours on hours,    Breast-deep in gold, soft-holding up a bee      To her hushed ear; or sitting under bowers                  Of greenery,    A butterfly a-tilt upon her knee;                Or, lounging on her hip,    Dancing a cricket on her finger-tip.IV    Aye, let me breathe hot scents that tell of you:      The hoary catnip and the meadow-mint,      On which the honour of your touch doth print    Itself as odour. Let me drink the hue      Of ironweed and mist-flow'r here that hint,                  With purple and blue,    The rapture that your presence doth imbue                Their inmost essence with,    Immortal though as transient as a myth.V    Yea, let me feed on sounds that still assure      Me where you hide: the brooks', whose happy din      Tells where, the deep retired woods within,    Disrobed, you bathe; the birds', whose drowsy lure      Tells where you slumber, your warm-nestling chin                  Soft on the pure    Pink cushion of your palm ... What better cure                For care and memory's ache    Than to behold you so and watch you wake!THE HIGHER BROTHERHOOD.    To come in touch with mysteries    Of beauty idealizing Earth,    Go seek the hills, grown old with trees,    The old hills wise with death and birth.    There you may hear the heart that beats    In streams, where music has its source;    And in wild rocks of green retreats    Behold the silent soul of force.    Above the love that emanates    From human passion, and reflects    The flesh, must be the love that waits    On Nature, whose high call elects    None to her secrets save the few    Who hold that facts are far less real    Than dreams, with which all facts indue    Themselves approaching the Ideal.GRAMARYE.    There are some things that entertain me more    Than men or books; and to my knowledge seem    A key of Poetry, made of magic lore    Of childhood, opening many a fabled door    Of superstition, mystery, and dream              Enchantment locked of yore.    For, when through dusking woods my pathway lies,    Often I feel old spells, as o'er me flits    The bat, like some black thought that, troubled, flies    Round some dark purpose; or before me cries    The owl that, like an evil conscience, sits              A shadowy voice and eyes.    Then, when down blue canals of cloudy snow    The white moon oars her boat, and woods vibrate    With crickets, lo, I hear the hautboys blow    Of Elf-land; and when green the fireflies glow,    See where the goblins hold a Fairy Fete              With lanthorn row on row.    Strange growths, that ooze from long-dead logs and spread    A creamy fungus, where the snail, uncoiled,    And fat slug feed at morn, are Pixy bread    Made of the yeasted dew; the lichens red,    Besides these grown, are meat the Brownies broiled              Above a glow-worm bed.    The smears of silver on the webs that line    The tree's crook'd roots, or stretch, white-wove, within    The hollow stump, are stains of Faery wine    Spilled on the cloth where Elf-land sat to dine,    When night beheld them drinking, chin to chin,              O' the moon's fermented shine.    What but their chairs the mushrooms on the lawn,    Or toadstools hidden under flower and fern,    Tagged with the dotting dew!--With knees updrawn    Far as his eyes, have I not come upon    PUCK seated there? but scarcely 'round could turn              Ere, presto! he was gone.    And so though Science from the woods hath tracked    The Elfin; and with prosy lights of day    Unhallowed all his haunts; and, dulling, blacked    Our eyesight, still hath Beauty never lacked    For seers yet; who, in some wizard way,              Prove Fancy real as Fact.DREAMS.    My thoughts have borne me far away    To Beauties of an older day,    Where, crowned with roses, stands the DAWN,    Striking her seven-stringed barbiton    Of flame, whose chords give being to    The seven colours, hue for hue;    The music of the colour-dream    She builds the day from, beam by beam.    My thoughts have borne me far away    To Myths of a diviner day,    Where, sitting on the mountain, NOON    Sings to the pines a sun-soaked tune    Of rest and shade and clouds and skies,    Wherein her calm dreams idealize    Light as a presence, heavenly fair,    Sleeping with all her beauty bare.    My thoughts have borne me far away    To Visions of a wiser day,    Where, stealing through the wilderness,    NIGHT walks, a sad-eyed votaress,    And prays with mystic words she hears    Behind the thunder of the spheres,    The starry utterance that's hers,    With which she fills the Universe.THE OLD HOUSE.    Quaint and forgotten, by an unused road,    An old house stands: around its doors the dense          Blue iron-weeds grow high;    The chipmunks make a highway of its fence;    And on its sunken flagstones slug and toad          Silent as lichens lie.    The timid snake upon its hearth's cool sand    Sleeps undisturbed; the squirrel haunts its roof;          And in the clapboard sides    Of closets, dim with many a spider woof,    Like the uncertain tapping of a hand,          The beetle-borer hides.    Above its lintel, under mossy eaves,    The mud-wasps build their cells; and in the floor          Of its neglected porch    The black bees nest. Through each deserted door,    Vague as a phantom's footsteps, steal the leaves,          And dropped cones of the larch.    But come with me when sunset's magic old    Transforms the ruin of that ancient house;          When windows, one by one,--    Like age's eyes, that youth's love-dreams arouse,--    Grow lairs of fire; and glad mouths of gold          Its wide doors, in the sun.    Or let us wait until each rain-stained room    Is carpeted with moonlight, pattened oft          With the deep boughs o'erhead;    And through the house the wind goes rustling soft,    As might the ghost--a whisper of perfume--        Of some sweet girl long dead.THE ROCK.    Here, at its base, in dingled deeps    Of spice-bush, where the ivy creeps,        The cold spring scoops its hollow;    And there three mossy stepping-stones    Make ripple murmurs; undertones        Of foam that blend and follow    With voices of the wood that drones.    The quail pipes here when noons are hot;    And here, in coolness sunlight-shot        Beneath a roof of briers,    The red-fox skulks at close of day;    And here at night, the shadows gray        Stand like FRANCISCAN friars,    With moonbeam beads whereon they pray.    Here yawns the ground-hog's dark-dug hole;    And there the tunnel of the mole        Heaves under weed and flower;    A sandy pit-fall here and there    The ant-lion digs and lies a-lair;        And here, for sun and shower,    The spider weaves a silvery snare.    The poison-oak's rank tendrils twine    The rock's south side; the trumpet-vine,        With crimson bugles sprinkled,    Makes green its eastern side; the west    Is rough with lichens; and, gray-pressed        Into an angle wrinkled,    The hornets hang an oblong nest.    The north is hid from sun and star,    And here,--like an Inquisitor        Of Faery Inquisition,    That roots out Elf-land heresy,--    Deep in the rock, with mystery        Cowled for his grave commission,    The Owl sits magisterially.RAIN.    Around, the stillness deepened; then the grain    Went wild with wind; and every briery lane    Was swept with dust; and then, tempestuous black,    Hillward the tempest heaved a monster back,    That on the thunder leaned as on a cane;    And on huge shoulders bore a cloudy pack,    That gullied gold from many a lightning-crack:    One great drop splashed and wrinkled down the pane,    And then field, hill, and wood were lost in rain.    At last, through clouds,--as from a cavern hewn    Into night's heart,--the sun burst, angry roon;    And every cedar, with its weight of wet,    Against the sunset's fiery splendour set,    Frightened to beauty, seemed with rubies strewn;    Then in drenched gardens, like sweet phantoms met,    Dim odours rose of pink and mignonette;    And in the East a confidence, that soon    Grew to the calm assurance of the Moon.STANDING-STONE CREEK.    A weed-grown slope, whereon the rain      Has washed the brown rocks bare,    Leads tangled from a lonely lane      Down to a creek's broad stair    Of stone, that, through the solitude,    Winds onward to a quiet wood.    An intermittent roof of shade      The beech above it throws;    Along its steps a balustrade      Of beauty builds the rose;    In which, a stately lamp of green    At intervals the cedar's seen.    The water, carpeting each ledge      Of rock that runs across,    Glints 'twixt a flow'r-embroidered edge      Of ferns and grass and moss;    And in its deeps the wood and sky    Seem patterns of the softest dye.    Long corridors of pleasant dusk      Within the house of leaves    It reaches; where, on looms of musk,      The ceaseless locust weaves    A web of summer; and perfume    Trails a sweet gown from room to room.    Green windows of the boughs, that swing,      It passes, where the notes    Of birds are glad thoughts entering,      And butterflies are motes;    And now a vista where the day    Opens a door of wind and ray.    It is a stairway for all sounds      That haunt the woodland sides;    On which, boy-like, the southwind bounds,      Girl-like, the sunbeam glides;    And, like fond parents, following these,    The oldtime dreams of rest and peace.THE MOONMEN.    I stood in the forest on HURON HILL    When the night was old and the world was still.    The Wind was a wizard who muttering strode    In a raven cloak on a haunted road.    The Sound of Water, a witch who crooned    Her spells to the rocks the rain had runed.    And the Gleam of the Dew on the fern's green tip    Was a sylvan passing with robe a-drip.    The Light of the Stars was a glimmering maid    Who stole, an elfin, from glade to glade.    The Scent of the Woods in the delicate air,    A wildflower shape with chilly hair.    And Silence, a spirit who sat alone    With a lifted finger and eyes of stone.    And it seemed to me these six were met    To greet a greater who came not yet.    And the speech they spoke, that I listened to,    Was the archetype of the speech I knew.    For the Wind clasped hands with the Water's rush,    And I heard them whisper, _Hush, oh, hush!_    The Light of the Stars and the Dew's cool gleam    Touched lips and murmured, _Dream, oh dream!_    The Scent of the Woods and the Silence deep    Sighed, bosom to bosom, _Sleep, oh, sleep!_    And so for a moment the six were dumb,    Then exulted together, _They come, they come!_    And I stood expectant and seemed to hear    A visible music drawing near.    And the first who came was the Captain Moon    Bearing a shield in GOD'S House hewn.    Then an Army of glamour, a glittering Host,    Beleaguered the night from coast to coast.    And the world was filled with spheric fire    From the palpitant chords of many a lyre,    As out of the East the MOONMEN came    Smiting their harps of silver and flame.    More beauty and grace did their forms express    Than the QUEEN OF LOVE'S white nakedness.    More chastity too their faces held    Than the snowy breasts of DIANA swelled.    Translucent-limbed, I saw the beat    In their hearts of pearl of the golden heat.    And the hair they tossed was a crystal light,    And the eyes beneath it were burning white.    Their hands that lifted, their feet that fell,    Made the darkness blossom to asphodel.    And the heavens, the hills, and the streams they trod    Shone pale with th' communicated God.    A placid frenzy, a waking trance,    A soft oracular radiance,    Wrapped forms that moved as melodies move,    Laurelled with god-head and halo'd with love.    So there in the forest on HURON HILL    The MOONMEN camped when the world was still....    What wonder that they who have looked on these    Are lost to the earth's realities!    That they sit aside with a far-off look    Dreaming the dreams that are writ in no book!    That they walk alone till the day they die,    Even as I, yea, even as I!THE OLD MAN DREAMS.    The blackened walnut in its spicy hull              Rots where it fell;    And, in the orchard, where the trees stand full,              The pear's ripe bell    Drops; and the log-house in the bramble lane,              From whose low door    Stretch yellowing acres of the corn and cane,              He sees once more.    The cat-bird sings upon its porch of pine;              And o'er its gate,    All slender-podded, twists the trumpet-vine,              A leafy weight;    And in the woodland, by the spring, mayhap,              With eyes of joy    Again he bends to set a rabbit-trap,              A brown-faced boy.    Then, whistling, through the underbrush he goes,              Out of the wood,    Where, with young cheeks, red as an _Autumn_ rose,              Beneath her hood,    His sweetheart waits, her school-books on her arm;              And now it seems    Beside his chair he sees his wife's fair form--              The old man dreams.SINCE THEN.    I found myself among the trees    What time the reapers ceased to reap;    And in the berry blooms the bees    Huddled wee heads and went to sleep,    Rocked by the silence and the breeze.    I saw the red fox leave his lair,    A shaggy shadow, on the knoll;    And, tunnelling his thoroughfare    Beneath the loam, I watched the mole--    Stealth's own self could not take more care.    I heard the death-moth tick and stir,    Slow-honeycombing through the bark;    I heard the crickets' drowsy chirr,    And one lone beetle burr the dark--    The sleeping woodland seemed to purr.    And then the moon rose; and a white    Low bough of blossoms--grown almost    Where, ere you died, 'twas our delight    To tryst,--dear heart!--I thought your ghost....    The wood is haunted since that night.COMRADES.    Down through the woods, along the way    That fords the stream; by rock and tree,    Where in the bramble-bell the bee    Swings; and through twilights green and gray    The red-bird flashes suddenly,    My thoughts went wandering to-day.    I found the fields where, row on row,    The blackberries hang black with fruit;    Where, nesting at the elder's root,    The partridge whistles soft and low;    The fields, that billow to the foot    Of those old hills we used to know.    There lay the pond, still willow-bound,    On whose bright surface, when the hot    Noon burnt above, we chased the knot    Of water-spiders; while around    Our heads, like bits of rainbow, shot    The dragonflies without a sound.    The pond, above which evening bent    To gaze upon her rosy face;    Wherein the twinkling night would place    A vague, inverted firmament,    In which the green frogs tuned their bass,    And firefly sparkles came and went.    The oldtime woods we often ranged,    When we were playmates, you and I;    The oldtime fields, with boyhood's sky    Still blue above them!--Naught was changed!    Nothing!--Alas, then tell me why    Should we be? whom long years estranged.WAITING.    Come to the hills, the woods are green--      _The heart is high when_ LOVE _is sweet_--    There is a brook that flows between      Two mossy trees where we can meet,    Where we can meet and speak unseen.    I hear you laughing in the lane--      _The heart is high when_ LOVE _is sweet_--    The clover smells of sun and rain      And spreads a carpet for our feet,    Where we can sit and dream again.    Come to the woods, the dusk is here--      _The heart is high when_ LOVE _is sweet_--    A bird upon the branches near      Sets music to our hearts' glad beat,    Our hearts that beat with something dear.    I hear your step; the lane is passed;--      _The heart is high when_ LOVE _is sweet_--    The little stars come bright and fast,      Like happy eyes to see us greet,    To see us greet and kiss at last.CONTRASTS.    No eve of summer ever can attain    The gladness of that eve of late _July_,    When 'mid the roses, filled with musk and rain,    Against the wondrous topaz of the sky,    I met you, leaning on the pasture bars,--    While heaven and earth grew conscious of the stars.    No night of blackest winter can repeat    The bitterness of that _December_ night,    When at your gate, gray-glittering with sleet,    Within the glimmering square of window-light,    We parted,--long you clung unto my arm,--    While heaven and earth surrendered to the storm.IN _June_.    Deep in the West a berry-coloured bar    Of sunset gleams; against which one tall fir    Is outlined dark; above which--courier    Of dew and dreams--burns dusk's appointed star.    And flash on flash, as when the elves wage war    In Goblinland, the fireflies bombard    The stillness; and, like spirits, o'er the sward    The glimmering winds bring fragrance from afar.    And now withdrawn into the hill-wood belts    A whippoorwill; while, with attendant states    Of purple and silver, slow the great moon melts    Into the night--to show me where _she_ waits,--    Like some slim moonbeam,--by the old beech-tree,    Who keeps her lips, fresh as a flower, for me.AFTER LONG GRIEF AND PAIN.    There is a place hung o'er with summer boughs    And drowsy skies wherein the gray hawk sleeps;    Where waters flow, within whose lazy deeps,    Like silvery prisms that the winds arouse,    The minnows twinkle; where the bells of cows    Tinkle the stillness, and the bob-white keeps    Calling from meadows where the reaper reaps,    And children's laughter haunts an old-time house;    A place where life wears ever an honest smell    Of hay and honey, sun and elder-bloom--    Like some dear, modest girl--within her hair:    Where, with our love for comrade, we may dwell    Far from the city's strife whose cares consume--    Oh, take my hand and let me lead you there._Can I Forget?_    Can I forget how LOVE once led the ways    Of our two lives together, joining them;    How every hour was his anadem,    And every day a tablet in his praise!    Can I forget how, in his garden place,    Among the purple roses, stem to stem,    We heard the rumour of his robe's bright hem,    And saw the aureate radiance of his face!--    Though I behold my soul's high dreams down-hurled,    And FALSEHOOD sit where Truth once towered white,    And in LOVE'S place, usurping lust and shame....    Though flowers be dead within the winter world,    Are flowers not there? and starless though the night,    Are stars not there, eternal and the same?THE HOUSE OF FEAR.    Vast are its halls, as vast the halls and lone    Where DEATH stalks listening to the wind and rain;    And dark that house, where I shall meet again    My long-dead Sin in some dread way unknown;    For I have dreamed of stairs of haunted stone,    And spectre footsteps I have fled in vain;    And windows glaring with a blood-red stain,    And horrible eyes, that burn me to the bone,    Within a face that looks as that black night    It looked when deep I dug for it a grave,--    The dagger wound above the brow, the thin    Blood trickling down slantwise the ghastly white;--    And I have dreamed not even GOD can save    Me and my soul from that risen Sin.AT DAWN.    Far off I heard dark waters rush;    The sky was cold; the dawn broke green;    And wrapped in twilight and strange hush    The gray wind moaned between.    A voice rang through the House of Sleep,    And through its halls there went a tread;    Mysterious raiment seemed to sweep    Around the pallid dead.    And then I knew that I had died,    I, who had suffered so and sinned--    And 't was myself I stood beside    In the wild dawn and wind.STORM.    I looked into the night and saw    GOD writing with tumultuous flame    Upon the thunder's front of awe,--    As on sonorous brass,--the Law,    Terrific, of HIS judgement name.    Weary of all life's best and worst,    With hands of hate, I--who had pled,    I, who had prayed for death at first    And had not died--now stood and cursed    GOD, yet he would not strike me dead.MEMORIES.    Here where LOVE lies perished,    Look not in upon the dead;    Lest the shadowy curtains, shaken    In my Heart's dark chamber, waken    Ghosts, beneath whose garb of sorrow    Whilom gladness bows his head:    When you come at morn to-morrow,    Look not in upon the dead,    Here where LOVE lies perished.    Here where LOVE lies cold interred,    Let no syllable be heard;    Lest the hollow echoes, housing    In my Soul's deep tomb, arousing    Wake a voice of woe, once laughter    Claimed and clothed in joy's own word:    When you come at dusk or after,    Let no syllable be heard,    Here where LOVE lies cold interred.WHICH?    The wind was on the forest,      And silence on the wold;    And darkness on the waters,      And heaven was starry cold;    When Sleep, with mystic magic,      Bade me this thing behold:    This side, an iron woodland;      That side, an iron waste;    And heaven, a tower of iron,      Wherein the wan moon paced,    Still as a phantom woman,      Ice-eyed and icy-faced.    And through the haunted tower      Of silence and of night,    My Soul and I went only,      My Soul, whose face was white,    Whose one hand signed me listen,      One bore a taper-light.    For, lo! a voice behind me      Kept sighing in my ear    The dreams my flesh accepted,      My mind refused to hear--    Of one I loved and loved not,      Whose spirit now spake near.    And, lo! a voice before me      Kept calling constantly    The hopes my mind accepted,      My flesh refused to see--    Of one I loved and loved not,      Whose spirit spake to me.    This way the one would bid me;      This way the other saith:--    Sweet is the voice behind me      Of LIFE that followeth;    And sweet the voice before me      Of LIFE whose name is DEATH.SUNSET IN _Autumn_.    Blood-coloured oaks, that stand against a sky of gold and brass;    Gaunt slopes, on which the bleak leaves glow of brier and sassafras,    And broom-sedge strips of smoky pink and pearl-gray clumps of grass,    In which, beneath the ragged sky, the rain-pools gleam like glass.    From West to East, from wood to wood, along the forest-side,    The winds,--the sowers of the LORD,--with thunderous footsteps stride;    Their stormy hands rain acorns down; and mad leaves, wildly dyed,    Like tatters of their rushing cloaks, stream round them far and wide.    The frail leaf-cricket in the weeds rings a faint fairy bell;    And like a torch of phantom ray the milkweed's windy shell    Glimmers; while wrapped in withered dreams, the wet autumnal smell    Of loam and leaf, like some sad ghost, steals over field and dell.    The oaks against a copper sky--o'er which, like some black lake    Of DIS, dark clouds, like surges fringed with sullen fire, break--    Loom sombre as Doom's citadel above the vales, that make    A pathway to a land of mist the moon's pale feet shall take.    Now, dyed with burning carbuncle, a Limbo-litten pane,    Within its wall of storm, the West opens to hill and plain,    On which the wild geese ink themselves, a far triangled train;    And then the shuttering clouds close down--and night is here again.THE LEGEND OF THE STONE.    The year was dying, and the day      Was almost dead;    The West, beneath a sombre gray,      Was sombre red.    The gravestones in the ghostly light,      'Mid trees half bare,    Seemed phantoms, clothed in glimmering white,      That haunted there.    I stood beside the grave of one,      Who, here in life,    Had wronged my home; who had undone      My child and wife.    I stood beside his grave until      The moon came up--    As if the dark, unhallowed hill      Lifted a cup.    No stone was there to mark his grave,      No flower to grace--    'T was meet that weeds alone should wave      In such a place.    I stood beside his grave until      The stars swam high,    And all the night was iron still      From sky to sky.    What cared I if strange eyes seemed bright      Within the gloom!    If, evil blue, a wandering light      Burnt by each tomb!    Or that each crooked thorn-tree seemed      A witch-hag cloaked!    Or that the owl above me screamed,      The raven croaked!    For I had cursed him when the day      Was sullen red;    Had cursed him when the West was gray,      And day was dead;    And now when night made dark the pole,      Both soon and late    I cursed his body, yea, and soul,      With the hate of hate.    Once in my soul I seemed to hear      A low voice say,--    _'T were better to forgive,--and fear      Thy God,--and pray._    I laughed; and from pale lips of stone      On sculptured tombs    A mocking laugh replied alone      Deep in the glooms.    And then I felt, I felt--as if      Some force should seize    The body; and its limbs stretch stiff,      And, fastening, freeze    Down, downward deeper than the knees      Into the earth--    While still among the twisted trees      That voice made mirth.    And in my Soul was fear, despair,--      Like lost ones feel,    When knotted in their pitch-stiff hair,      They feel the steel    Of devils' forks lift up, through sleet      Of hell's slant fire,    Then plunge,--as white from head to feet      I grew entire.    A voice without me, yet within,      As still as frost,    Intoned: _Thy sin is thrice a sin,      Thrice art thou lost.    Behold, how God would punish thee!      For this thy crime--    Thy crime of hate and blasphemy--      Through endless time!_    _O'er him, whom thou wouldst not forgive,      Record what good    He did on earth! and let him live      Loved, understood!    Be memory thine of all the worst      He did thine own!_    There at the head of him I cursed      I stood--a stone.TIME AND DEATH AND LOVE.    Last night I watched for Death--      So sick of life was I!--    When in the street beneath      I heard his watchman cry      The hour, while passing by.    I called. And in the night      I heard him stop below,    His owlish lanthorn's light      Blurring the windy snow--      How long the time and slow!    I said, _Why dost thou cower      There at my door and knock?    Come in! It is the hour!      Cease fumbling at the lock!      Naught's well! 'Tis no o'clock!_    Black through the door with him      Swept in the _Winter's_ breath;    His cloak was great and grim--      But he, who smiled beneath,      Had the face of Love not Death.PASSION.    The wine-loud laughter of indulged Desire    Upon his lips, and, in his eyes, the fire    Of uncontrol, he takes in reckless hands,--    And interrupts with discords,--the sad lyre    Of LOVE'S deep soul, and never understands._When the Wine-Cup at the Lip._    When the wine-cup at the lip      Slants its sparkling fire,    O'er its level, while you sip,    Have you marked the finger-tip    Of the god DESIRE slip,      Of the god DESIRE?    Saying--_Lo, the hours run!    Live your day before 't is done!_    When the empty goblet lies      At the ended revel,    In the glass, the wine-stain dyes,    Have you marked the hollow eyes    Of a mocking Devil rise,      Of a mocking Devil?    Saying--_Lo, the day is through!    Look on joy it gave to you!_ART.[_A Phantasy._]    I know not how I found you      With your wild hair a-blow,    Nor why the world around you      Would never let me know:    Perhaps 't was Heaven relented,    Perhaps 't was Hell resented    My dream, and grimly vented      Its hate upon me so.    In Shadowland I met you      Where all dim shadows meet;    Within my heart I set you,      A phantom bitter-sweet:    No hope for me to win you,    Though I with soul and sinew    Strive on and on, when in you      There is no heart or heat!    Yet ever, aye, and ever,      Although I knew you lied,    I followed on, but never      Would your white form abide:    With loving arms stretched meward,    As Sirens beckon seaward    To some fair vessel leeward,      Before me you would glide.    But like an evil fairy,      That mocks one with a light,    Now near, you led your airy,      Now far, your fitful flight:    With red-gold tresses blowing,    And eyes of sapphire glowing,    With limbs like marble showing,      You lured me through the night.    To some unearthly revel      Of mimes, a motley crew,    'Twixt Angel-land and Devil,      You lured me on, I knew,    And lure me still! soft whiling    The way with hopes beguiling,    While dark Despair sits smiling      Behind the eyes of you!A SONG FOR OLD AGE.    Now nights grow cold and colder,      And North the wild vane swings,    And round each tree and boulder      The driving snow-storm sings--    Come, make my old heart older,      O memory of lost things!    Of Hope, when promise sung her      Brave songs and I was young,    That banquets now on hunger      Since all youth's songs are sung;    Of Love, who walks with younger      Sweethearts the flowers among.    Ah, well! while Life holds levee,      Death's ceaseless dance goes on.    So let the curtains, heavy      About my couch, be drawn--    The curtains, sad and heavy,      Where all shall sleep anon._Tristram And Isolt._    Night and vast caverns of rock and of iron;    Voices like water, and voices like wind;    Horror and tempests of hail that environ    Shapes and the shadows of two who have sinned.    Wan on the whirlwind, in loathing uplifting    Faces that loved once, forever they go,    TRISTAM and ISOLT, the lovers, go drifting,    The sullen laughter of Hell below.THE BETTER LOT.    Her life was bound to crutches: pale and bent,    But smiling ever, she would go and come:    For of her soul GOD made an instrument    Of strength and comfort to an humble home.    Better a life of toil and slow disease    That LOVE companions through the patient years,    Than one whose heritage is loveless ease,    That never knows the blessedness of tears.DUSK IN THE WOODS.    Three miles of hill it is; and I    Came through the woods that waited, dumb,    For the cool _Summer_ dusk to come;    And lingered there to watch the sky    Up which the gradual sunset clomb.    A tree-toad quavered in a tree;    And then a sudden whip-poor-will    Called overhead, so wildly shrill,    The startled woodland seemed to see    How very lone it was and still.    Then through dark boughs its stealthy flight    An owl took; and, at sleepy strife,    The cricket turned its fairy fife;    And through the dead leaves, in the night,    Soft rustlings stirred of unseen life.    And in the punk-wood everywhere    The inserts ticked, or bored below    The rotted bark; and, glow on glow,    The gleaming fireflies here and there    Lit up their Jack-o'-lantern show.    I heard a vesper-sparrow sing,    Withdrawn, it seemed, into the far    Slow sunset's tranquil cinnabar;    The sunset, softly smouldering    Behind gaunt trunks, with its one star.    A dog barked; and down ways, that gleamed,    Through dew and clover faint the noise    Of cow-bells moved. And then a voice,    That sang a-milking, so it seemed,    Made glad my heart as some glad boy's.    And then the lane; and full in view    A farmhouse with a rose-grown gate,    And honeysuckle paths, await    For night's white moon and love and you--    These are the things that made me late.AT THE FERRY.    Oh, dim and wan came in the dawn,      And gloomy closed the day;    The killdee whistled among the weeds,    The heron flapped in the river reeds,      And the snipe piped far away.    At dawn she stood--her dark gray hood      Flung back--in the ferry-boat;    Sad were the eyes that watched him ride,    Her raider love, from the riverside,      His kiss on her mouth and throat.    Like some wild spell the twilight fell,      And black the tempest came;    The heavens seemed filled with the warring dead,    Whose batteries opened overhead      With thunder and with flame.    At night again in the wind and rain,      She toiled at the ferry oar;    For she heard a voice in the night and storm,    And it seemed that her lover's shadowy form      Beckoned her to the shore.    And swift to save she braved the wave,      And reached the shore and found    His riderless horse, with head hung low,    A blur of blood on the saddle-bow,      And the empty night around.HER VIOLIN.I    Her violin!--Again begin    The dream-notes of her violin;    And dim and fair, with gold-brown hair,    I seem to see her standing there,    Soft-eyed and sweetly slender:    The room again, with strain on strain,    Vibrates to LOVE's melodious pain,    As, sloping slow, is poised her bow,    While round her form the golden glow    Of sunset spills its splendour.II    Her violin!--now deep, now thin,    Again I hear her violin;    And, dream by dream, again I seem    To see the love-light's tender gleam    Beneath her eyes' long lashes:    While to my heart she seems a part    Of her pure song's inspired art;    And, as she plays, the rosy grays    Of twilight halo hair and face,    While sunset burns to ashes.III    O violin!--Cease, cease within    My soul, O haunting violin!    In vain, in vain, you bring again    Back from the past the blissful pain    Of all the love then spoken;    When on my breast, at happy rest,    A sunny while her head was pressed--    Peace, peace to these wild memories!    For, like my heart naught remedies,    Her violin lies broken.HER VESPER SONG.    The _Summer_ lightning comes and goes    In one pale cloud above the hill,    As if within its soft repose    A burning heart were never still--    As in my bosom pulses beat    Before the coming of his feet.    All drugged with odorous sleep, the rose    Breathes dewy balm about the place,    As if the dreams the garden knows    Took immaterial form and face--    As in my heart sweet thoughts arise    Beneath the ardour of his eyes.    The moon above the darkness shows    An orb of silvery snow and fire,    As if the night would now disclose    To heav'n her one divine desire--    As in the rapture of his kiss    All of my soul is drawn to his.    The cloud, it knows not that it glows;    The rose knows nothing of its scent;    Nor knows the moon that it bestows    Light on our earth and firmament--    So is the soul unconscious of    The beauties it reveals through LOVE.AT PARTING.    What is there left for us to say,    Now it has come to say good-by?    And all our dreams of yesterday    Have vanished in the sunset sky--    What is there left for us to say,    Now different ways before us lie?    A word of hope, a word of cheer,    A word of love, that still shall last,    When we are far to bring us near    Through memories of the happy past;    A word of hope, a word of cheer,    To keep our sad hearts true and fast.    What is there left for us to do,    Now it has come to say farewell?    And care, that bade us once adieu,    Returns again with us to dwell--    What is there left for us to do,    Now different ways our fates compel?    Clasp hands and sigh, touch lips and smile,    And look the love that shall remain--    When severed so by many a mile--    The sweetest balm for bitterest pain;    Clasp hands and sigh, touch lips and smile,    And trust in GOD to meet again.CARISSIMA MEA.    I look upon my lady's face,      And, in the world about me, see    No face like hers in any place:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    It is not made, as others sing      Of their dear loves, like ivory,    But like a wild rose in the spring:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Her brow is low and very fair,      And o'er it, smooth and shadowy,    Lies deep the darkness of her hair:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Beneath her brows her eyes are gray,      And gaze out glad and fearlessly,    Their wonder haunts me night and day:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Her eyebrows, arched and delicate,      Twin curves of pencilled ebony,    Within their spans contain my fate:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Her mouth, that was for kisses curved,      So small and sweet, it well may be    That it for me is yet reserved:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Between her hair and rounded chin,      Calm with her soul's calm purity,    There lies no shadow of a sin:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Of perfect form, she is not tall,      Just higher than the heart of me,    Where'er I place her, all in all:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    She is not shaped, as some have sung      Of their dear loves, like some slim tree,    But like the moon when it is young:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Her hands, that smell of violet,     So white and fashioned gracefully,    Have woven round my heart a net:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Yea, I have loved her many a day;      And though for me she may not be,    Still at her feet my love I lay:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise._    Albeit she be not for me,    GOD send her grace and grant that she    Know nought of sorrow all her days:    _Therefore it is I sing her praise.__Margery._I    When _Spring_ is here and MARGERY    Goes walking in the woods with me,    She is so white, she is so shy,    The little leaves clap hands and cry--                _Perdie!    So white is she, so sky is she,                Ah me!    The maiden May hath just passed by!_II    When _Summer's_ here and MARGERY    Goes walking in the fields with me,    She is so pure, she is so fair,    The wildflowers eye her and declare--                _Perdie!    So pure is she, so fair is she,                Just see,    Where our sweet cousin takes the air!_III    Why is it that my MARGERY    Hears nothing that these say to me?    She is so good, she is so true,    My heart it maketh such ado;                _Perdie!    So good is she, so true is she,                You see,    She can not hear the other two.__Constance._    Beyond the orchard, in the lane,    The crested red-bird sings again--    O bird, whose song says, _Have no care._    Should I not care when CONSTANCE there,--    My CONSTANCE, with the bashful gaze,    Pink-gowned like some sweet hollyhock,--    If I declare my love, just says    Some careless thing as if in mock?    Like--_Past the orchard, in the lane,    How sweet the red-bird sings again_!    There, while the red-bird sings his best,    His listening mate sits on the nest--    O bird, whose patience says, _All's well_,    How can it be with me, now tell?    When CONSTANCE, with averted eyes,--    Soft-bonneted as some sweet-pea,--    If I speak marriage, just replies    With some such quaint irrelevancy,    As, _While the red-bird sings his best,    His loving mate sits on the nest_.    What shall I say? what can I do?    Would such replies mean aught to you,    O birds, whose gladness says, _Be glad_?    Have I not reason to be sad    When CONSTANCE, with demurest glance,    Her face a-poppy with distress,    If I reproach her, pouts, perchance,    And answers so in waywardness?--    _What shall I say? what can I do?    My meaning should be plain to you!__Gertrude._    When first I gazed on GERTRUDE'S face,    Beheld her loveliness and grace;    Her brave gray eyes, her raven hair,    Her ways, more winsome than the kiss    _Spring_ gives the flowers; her smile, that is    Brighter than all the summer air    Made sweet with birds:--I did declare,--    And still declare!--there is no one,    No girl beneath the moon or sun,    So beautiful to look upon!    And to my thoughts, that on her dwell,    Nothing seems more desirable--    Not OPHIR gold nor ORIENT pearls--    Than seems this jewel-girl of girls._Lydia._    When Autumn's here and days are short,      Let LYDIA laugh and, hey!    Straightway 't is _May-day_ in my heart,      And blossoms strew the way.    When _Summer's_ here and days are long,      Let LYDIA sigh and, ho!    _December's_ fields I walk among,      And shiver in the snow.    No matter what the Seasons are,      My LYDIA is so dear,    My soul admits no Calendar      Of earth when she is near.A SOUTHERN GIRL.    Serious but smiling, stately and serene,      And dreamier than a flower;    A girl in whom all sympathies convene      As perfumes in a bower;    Through whom one feels what soul and heart may mean,      And their resistless power.    Eyes, that commune with the frank skies of truth,      Where thought like starlight curls;    Lips of immortal rose, where love and youth      Nestle like two sweet pearls;    Hair, that suggests the Bible braids of RUTH,      Deeper than any girl's.    When first I saw you, 't was as if within      My soul took shape some song--    Played by a master of the violin--      A music pure and strong,    That rapt my soul above all earthly sin      To heights that know no wrong.A DAUGHTER OF THE STATES.    She has the eyes of some barbarian Queen    Leading her wild tribes into battle; eyes,    Wherein th' unconquerable soul defies,    And Love sits throned, imperious and serene.    And I have thought that Liberty, alone    Among the mountain stars, might look like her,    Kneeling to GOD, her only emperor,    Kindling her torch on FREEDOM'S altar-stone.    For in her self, regal with riches of    Beauty and youth, again those Queens seem born--    BOADICEA, meeting scorn with scorn,    And ERMENGARDE, returning love for love.AN _Autumn_ NIGHT.    Some things are good on _Autumn_ nights,    When with the storm the forest fights,    And in the room the heaped hearth lights        Old-fashioned press and rafter:    Plump chestnuts hissing in the heat,    A mug of cider, sharp and sweet,    And at your side a face petite,        With lips of laughter.    Upon the roof the rolling rain,    And tapping at the window-pane,    The wind that seems a witch's cane        That summons spells together:    A hand within your own awhile;    A mouth reflecting back your smile;    And eyes, two stars, whose beams exile        All thoughts of weather.    And, while the wind lulls, still to sit    And watch her fire-lit needles flit    A-knitting, and to feel her knit        Your very heartstrings in it:    Then, when the old clock ticks _'tis late_,    To rise, and at the door to wait,    Two words, or at the garden gate,        A kissing minute.LINES.    If GOD should say to me, _Behold!--        Yea, who shall doubt?--    They who love others more than me,    Shall I not turn, as oft of old,    My face from them and cast them out?    So let it be with thee, behold!_--    I should not care, for in your face        Is all GOD'S grace.    If GOD should say to me, _Behold!--        Is it not well?--    They who have other gods than me,    Shall I not bid them, as of old,    Depart into the outer_ HELL?    _So let it be with thee, behold!_--    I should not care, for in your eyes        Is PARADISE.THE BLIND GOD.    I know not if she be unkind,      If she have faults I do not care;    Search through the world--where will you find    A face like hers, a form, a mind?      _I love her to despair._    If she be cruel, cruelty      Is a great virtue, I will swear;    If she be proud--then pride must be    Akin to Heaven's divinest three--      _I love her to despair._    Why speak to me of that and this?      All you may say weighs not a hair!    In her,--whose lips I may not kiss,--    To me naught but perfection is!--      _I love her to despair._A VALENTINE.    My life is grown a witchcraft place    Through gazing on thy form and face.    Now 't is thy Smile's soft sorcery    That makes my soul a melody.    Now 't is thy Frown, that comes and goes,    That makes my heart a page of prose.    Some day, perhaps, a word of thine    Will change me to thy VALENTINE.A CATCH.    When roads are mired with ice and snow,    And the air of morn is crisp with rime;    When the holly hangs by the mistletoe,    And bells ring in the CHRISTMAS time:--    It's--Saddle, my Heart, and ride away,    To the sweet-faced girl with the eyes of gray!    Who waits with a smile for the gifts you bring--    A man's strong love and a wedding-ring--        It's--Saddle, my Heart, and ride!    When vanes veer North and storm-winds blow,    And the sun of noon is a blur o'erhead;    When the holly hangs by the mistletoe,    And the CHRISTMAS service is sung and said:--    It's--Come, O my Heart, and wait awhile,    Where the organ peals, in the altar aisle,    For the gifts that the church now gives to you--    A woman's hand and a heart that's true.        It's--Come, O my Heart, and wait!    When rooms gleam warm with the fire's glow,    And the sleet raps sharp on the window-pane;    When the holly hangs by the mistletoe,    And CHRISTMAS revels begin again:--    It's--Home, O my Heart, and love, at last!    And her happy breast to your own held fast;    A song to sing and a tale to tell,    A good-night kiss, and all is well.        It's--Home, O my Heart, and love!THE NEW YEAR.    Lift up thy torch, O Year, and let us see            What Destiny    Hath made thee heir to at nativity!    Doubt, some call Faith; and ancient Wrong and Might,            Whom some name Right;    And Darkness, that the purblind world calls Light.    Despair, with Hope's brave form; and Hate, who goes            In Friendship's clothes;    And Happiness, the mask of many woes.    Neglect, whom Merit serves; Lust, to whom, see,            Love bends the knee;    And Selfishness, who preacheth charity.    Vice, in whose dungeon Virtue lies in chains;            And Cares and Pains,    That on the throne of Pleasure hold their reigns.    Corruption, known as Honesty; and Fame            That's but a name;    And Innocence, the outward guise of Shame.    And Folly, men call Wisdom here, forsooth;            And, like a youth,    Fair Falsehood, whom some worship for the Truth.    Abundance, who hath Famine's house in lease;            And, high 'mid these,    War, blood-black, on the spotless shrine of Peace.    Lift up thy torch, O Year! assist our sight!            Deep lies the night    Around us, and GOD grants us little light!THEN AND NOW.    When my old heart was young, my dear,    The Earth and Heaven were so near    That in my dreams I oft could hear        The steps of unseen races;    In woodlands, where bright waters ran,    On hills, GOD'S rainbows used to span,    I followed voices not of man,        And smiled in spirit faces.    Now my old heart is old, my sweet,    No longer Earth and Heaven meet;    All Life is grown to one long street        Where fact with fancy clashes;    The voices now that speak to me    Are prose instead of poetry:    And in the faces now I see        Is less of flame than ashes.EPILOGUE.    Beyond the moon, within a land of mist,        Lies the dim Garden of all Dead Desires,    Walled round with morning's clouded amethyst,        And haunted of the sunset's shadowy fires;    There all lost things we loved hold ghostly tryst--        Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires.    Sad are the stars that day and night exist        Above the Garden of all Dead Desires;    And sad the roses that within it twist        Deep bow'rs; and sad the wind that through it quires;    But sadder far are they who there hold tryst--        Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires.    There, like a dove, upon the twilight's wrist,        Soft in the Garden of all Dead Desires,    Sleep broods; and there, where never a serpent hissed,        On the wan willows music hangs her lyres,    AEOLIAN dials by which phantoms tryst--        Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires.    There you shall hear low voices; kisses kissed,        Faint in the Garden of all Dead Desires,    By lips the anguish of vain song makes whist;        And meet with shapes that art's despair attires;    And gaze in eyes where all sweet sorrows tryst--        Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires.    Thither we go, dreamer and realist,        Bound for the Garden of all Dead Desires,    Where we shall find, perhaps, all Life hath missed,        All Life hath longed for when the soul aspires,    All Earth's elusive loveliness at tryst--        Dead dreams, dead hopes, dead loves, and dead desires.       *       *       *       *       *End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shapes and Shadows, by Madison J.

Ballantyne.________________________________________________________________________Although the book's title Black Ivory denotes dealing in the slave tradeit is not our heroes who are doing it.  At the very first chapter thereis a shipwreck, which leaves the son of the charterer of the sinkingship, and a seaman friend of his, alone on the east coast of Africa,where Arab and Portuguese slave traders were still carrying out theirevil trade, despite the great efforts of patrolling British warships tolimit it and free the unfortunates whom they found being carried away inthe Arab dhows.Our heroes encountered a slave trader almost at the very spot where theycome ashore, and thereby managed to get to Zanzibar in a British warshipthat had captured the trader's dhow in which our friends had hitched alift.At Zanzibar they pick up some funds, and set forth on a journey into theinterior.  Here again they encounter the vile trade, but most of thestory deals with other encounters of a more acceptable nature.This book will open your eyes to what really went on.  At the time ofwriting slave-dealing on the west coast of Africa was, due to theefforts of the British, almost extinct, but this was not the case on theeast coast.  Your reviewer found it very moving.Makes a good audiobook, of about ten and a half hours duration.________________________________________________________________________BLACK IVORY, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.In writing this book, my aim has been to give a true picture in outlineof the Slave Trade as it exists at the present time on the east coast ofAfrica.In order to do this I have selected from the most trustworthy sourceswhat I believe to be the most telling points of "the trade," and havewoven these together into a tale, the warp of which is composed of thickcords of fact; the woof of slight lines of fiction, just sufficient tohold the fabric together.  Exaggeration has easily beenavoided, because--as Dr Livingstone says in regard to theslave-trade--"exaggeration is impossible."If the reader's taste should be offended by finding the tragic and comicelements in too close proximity I trust that he will bear in remembrancethat "such is life," and that the writer who would be true to life mustfollow, not lead, nature.I have to acknowledge myself indebted to Dr Ryan, late Bishop ofMauritius; to the Rev.  Charles New, interpreter to the LivingstoneSearch Expedition; to Edward Hutchinson, Esquire, Lay Secretary to theChurch Missionary Society, and others, for kindly furnishing me withinformation in connexion with the slave trade.Besides examining the Parliamentary Blue-books which treat of thissubject, I have read or consulted, among others, the variousauthoritative works to which reference is made in the foot-notessprinkled throughout this book,--all of which works bear the strongestpossible testimony to the fact that the horrible traffic in human beingsis in all respects as bad at the present time on the east coast ofAfrica as it ever was on the west coast in the days of Wilberforce.I began my tale in the hope that I might produce something to interestthe young (perchance, also, the old) in a most momentous cause,--thetotal abolition of the African slave-trade.  I close it with the prayerthat God may make it a tooth in the file which shall eventually cut thechains of slavery, and set the black man free.R.M. Ballantyne.1873CHAPTER ONE.SHOWS THAT A GOOD BEGINNING MAY SOMETIMES BE FOLLOWED BY A BAD ENDING."Six feet water in the hold, sir!"That would not have been a pleasant announcement to the captain of the`Aurora' at any time, but its unpleasantness was vastly increased by thefact that it greeted him near the termination of what had been, up tothat point of time, an exceedingly prosperous voyage."Are you sure, Davis?" asked the captain; "try again."He gave the order under the influence of that feeling which is styled"hoping against hope," and himself accompanied the ship's carpenter tosee it obeyed."Six feet two inches," was the result of this investigation.The vessel, a large English brig, had sprung a leak, and was rollingheavily in a somewhat rough sea off the east coast of Africa.  It was noconsolation to her captain that the shores of the great continent werevisible on his lee, because a tremendous surf roared along the wholeline of coast, threatening destruction to any vessel that should ventureto approach, and there was no harbour of refuge nigh."She's sinking fast, Mr Seadrift," said the captain to a stoutfrank-looking youth of about twenty summers, who leant against thebulwarks and gazed wistfully at the land; "the carpenter cannot find theleak, and the rate at which the water is rising shows that she cannotfloat long.""What then do you propose to do?" inquired young Seadrift, with atroubled expression of countenance."Abandon her," replied the captain."Well, _you_ may do so, captain, but I shall not forsake my father'sship as long as she can float.  Why not beach her somewhere on thecoast?  By so doing we might save part of the cargo, and, at all events,shall have done the utmost that lay in our power.""Look at the coast," returned the captain; "where would you beach her?No doubt there is smooth water inside the reef, but the channels throughit, if there be any here, are so narrow that it would be almost certaindeath to make the attempt."The youth turned away without replying.  He was sorely perplexed.  Justbefore leaving England his father had said to him, "Harold, my boy,here's your chance for paying a visit to the land you've read and talkedso much about, and wished so often to travel through.  I have chartereda brig, and shall send her out to Zanzibar with a cargo of beads, cottoncloth, brass wire, and such like: what say you to go as supercargo?  Ofcourse you won't be able to follow in the steps of Livingstone or MungoPark, but while the brig is at Zanzibar you will have an opportunity ofrunning across the channel, the island being only a few miles from themain, and having a short run up-country to see the niggers, andperchance have a slap at a hippopotamus.  I'll line your pockets, sothat you won't lack the sinews of war, without which travel either athome or abroad is but sorry work, and I shall only expect you to give agood account of ship and cargo on your return.--Come, is it fixed?"Need we say that Harold leaped joyfully at the proposal?  And now, herehe was, called on to abandon the `Aurora' to her fate, as we have said,near the end of a prosperous voyage.  No wonder that he was perplexed.The crew were fully aware of the state of matters.  By the captain'sorders they stood ready to lower the two largest boats, into which theyhad put much of their worldly goods and provisions as they could holdwith safety."Port, port your helm," said the captain to the man at the wheel."Port it is, sir," replied the man at the wheel, who was one of thosebroad-shouldered, big-chested, loose-garmented, wide-trousered,bare-necked, free-and-easy, off-hand jovial tars who have done so much,in years gone by, to increase the wealth and prosperity of the BritishEmpire, and who, although confessedly scarce, are considerately allowedto perish in hundreds annually on our shores for want of a littlereasonable legislation.  But cheer up, ye jolly tars!  There is aglimmer of sunrise on your political horizon.  It really does seem asif, in regard to you, there were at last "a good time coming.""Port, port," repeated the captain, with a glance at the compass and thesky."Port it is, sir," again replied the jovial one."Steady!  Lower away the boat, lads.--Now, Mr Seadrift," said thecaptain, turning with an air of decision to the young supercargo, "thetime has come for you to make up your mind.  The water is rising in thehold, and the ship is, as you see, settling fast down.  I need not sayto you that it is with the utmost regret I find it necessary to abandonher; but self-preservation and the duty I owe to my men render the stepabsolutely necessary.  Do you intend to go with us?""No, captain, I don't," replied Harold Seadrift firmly.  "I do not blameyou for consulting your own safety, and doing what you believe to beyour duty, but I have already said that I shall stick by the ship aslong as she can float.""Well, sir, I regret it but you must do as you think best," replied thecaptain, turning away--"Now, lads, jump in."The men obeyed, but several of those who were last to quit the shiplooked back and called to the free-and-easy man who still stood at thewheel--"Come along, Disco; we'll have to shove off directly.""Shove off w'en you please," replied the man at the wheel, in a deeprich voice, whose tones were indicative of a sort of good-humouredcontempt; "wot I means for to do is to stop where I am.  It'll never besaid of Disco Lillihammer that he forsook the owner's son in distress.""But you'll go to the bottom, man, if you don't come.""Well, wot if I do?  I'd raither go to the bottom with a brave man, thanremain at the top with a set o' fine fellers like _you_!"Some of the men received this reply with a laugh, others frowned, and afew swore, while some of them looked regretfully at their self-willedshipmate; for it must not be supposed that _all_ the tars who float uponthe sea are of the bold, candid, open-handed type, though we reallybelieve that a large proportion of them are so.Be this as it may, the boats left the brig, and were soon far astern."Thank you, Lillihammer," said Harold, going up and grasping the hornyhand of the self-sacrificing sea-dog.  "This is very kind of you, thoughI fear it may cost you your life.  But it is too late to talk of that;we must fix on some plan, and act at once.""The werry thing, sir," said Disco quietly, "that wos runnin' in my ownmind, 'cos it's werry clear that we hain't got too many minits to sparein confabilation.""Well, what do you suggest?""Arter you, sir," said Disco, pulling his forelock; "you are captingnow, an' ought to give orders.""Then I think the best thing we can do," rejoined Harold, "is to makestraight for the shore, search for an opening in the reef, run through,and beach the vessel on the sand.  What say you?""As there's nothin' else left for us to do," replied Disco, "that's'zactly wot I think too, an' the sooner we does it the better.""Down with the helm, then," cried Harold, springing forward, "and I'llease off the sheets."In a few minutes the `Aurora' was surging before a stiff breeze towardsthe line of foam which indicated the outlying reef, and inside of whichall was comparatively calm."If we only manage to get inside," said Harold, "we shall do well."Disco made no reply.  His whole attention was given to steering thebrig, and running his eyes anxiously along the breakers, the sound ofwhich increased to a thunderous roar as they drew near."There seems something like a channel yonder," said Harold, pointinganxiously to a particular spot in the reef."I see it, sir," was the curt reply.A few minutes more of suspense, and the brig drove into the supposedchannel, and struck with such violence that the foremast snapped offnear the deck, and went over the side."God help us, we're lost!" exclaimed Harold, as a towering wave liftedthe vessel up and hurled her like a plaything on the rocks."Stand by to jump, sir," cried Disco.  Another breaker came roaring inat the moment, overwhelmed the brig, rolled her over on her beam-ends,and swept the two men out of her.  They struggled gallantly to freethemselves from the wreck, and, succeeding with difficulty, swam acrossthe sheltered water to the shore, on which they finally landed.Harold's first exclamation was one of thankfulness for theirdeliverance, to which Disco replied with a hearty "Amen!" and thenturning round and surveying the coast, while he slowly thrust his handsinto his wet trouser-pockets, wondered whereabouts in the world they hadgot to."To the east coast of Africa, to be sure," observed the youngsupercargo, with a slight smile, as he wrung the water out of the footof his trousers, "the place we were bound for, you know.""Werry good; so here we are--come to an anchor!  Well, I only wish," headded, sitting down on a piece of driftwood, and rummaging in thepockets before referred to, as if in search of something--"I only wishI'd kep' on my weskit, 'cause all my 'baccy's there, and it would be arael comfort to have a quid in the circumstances."It was fortunate for the wrecked voyagers that the set of the currenthad carried portions of their vessel to the shore, at a considerabledistance from the spot where they had landed, because a band of natives,armed with spears and bows and arrows, had watched the wreck from theneighbouring heights, and had hastened to that part of the coast onwhich they knew from experience the cargo would be likely to drift.  Theheads of the swimmers being but small specks in the distance, hadescaped observation.  Thus they had landed unseen.  The spot was nearthe entrance to a small river or creek, which was partially concealed bythe formation of the land and by mangrove trees.Harold was the first to observe that they had not been cast on anuninhabited shore.  While gazing round him, and casting about in hismind what was best to be done, he heard shouts, and hastening to a rockypoint that hid part of the coast from his view looked cautiously over itand saw the natives.  He beckoned to Disco, who joined him."They haven't a friendly look about 'em," observed the seaman, "andthey're summat scant in the matter of clothin'.""Appearances are often deceptive," returned his companion, "but I so faragree with you that I think our wisest course will be to retire into thewoods, and there consult as to our future proceedings, for it is quitecertain that as we cannot live on sand and salt water, neither can wesafely sleep in wet clothes or on the bare ground in a climate likethis."Hastening towards the entrance to the creek, the unfortunate pairentered the bushes, through which they pushed with some difficulty,until they gained a spot sufficiently secluded for their purpose, whenthey observed that they had passed through a belt of underwood, beyondwhich there appeared to be an open space.  A few steps further and theycame out on a sort of natural basin formed by the creek, in whichfloated a large boat of a peculiar construction, with verypiratical-looking lateen sails.  Their astonishment at this unexpectedsight was increased by the fact that on the opposite bank of the creekthere stood several men armed with muskets, which latter wereimmediately pointed at their breasts.The first impulse of the shipwrecked friends was to spring back into thebushes--the second to advance and hold up their empty hands to show thatthey were unarmed."Hold on," exclaimed Disco, in a free and easy confidential tone; "we'refriends, we are; shipwrecked mariners we is, so ground arms, my lads,an' make your minds easy."One of the men made some remark to another, who, from his Orientaldress, was easily recognised by Harold as one of the Arab traders of thecoast.  His men appeared to be half-castes.The Arab nodded gravely, and said something which induced his men tolower their muskets.  Then with a wave of his hand he invited thestrangers to come over the creek to him.This was rendered possible by the breadth of the boat already mentionedbeing so great that, while one side touched the right bank of the creek,the other was within four or five feet of the left.Without hesitation Harold Seadrift bounded lightly from the bank to thehalf-deck of the boat, and, stepping ashore, walked up to the Arab,closely followed by his companion."Do you speak English?" asked Harold.The Arab shook his head and said, "Arabic, Portuguese."Harold therefore shook _his_ head;--then, with a hopeful look, said"French?" interrogatively.The Arab repeated the shake of his head, but after a moments' thoughtsaid, "I know littil Engleesh; speak, where comes you?""We have been wrecked," began Harold (the Arab glanced gravely at hisdripping clothes, as if to say, I had guessed as much), "and this manand I are the only survivors of the crew of our ship--at least the onlytwo who swam on shore, the others went off in a boat.""Come you from man-of-war?" asked the Arab, with a keen glance at thecandid countenance of the youth."No, our vessel was a trader bound for Zanzibar.  She now lies infragments on the shore, and we have escaped with nothing but the clotheson our backs.  Can you tell us whether there is a town or a village inthe neighbourhood? for, as you see, we stand sadly in need of clothing,food, and shelter.  We have no money, but we have good muscles and stouthearts, and could work our way well enough, I doubt not."Young Seadrift said this modestly, but the remark was unnecessary, forit would have been quite obvious to a man of much less intelligence thanthe Arab that a youth who, although just entering on the age of manhood,was six feet high, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, and as lithe as akitten, could not find any difficulty in working his way, while hiscompanion, though a little older, was evidently quite as capable."There be no town, no village, for fifty miles from where you stand,"replied the Arab."Indeed!" exclaimed Harold in surprise, for he had always supposed theEast African coast to be rather populous."That's a blue look-out anyhow," observed Disco, "for it necessitatesstarvation, unless this good gentleman will hire us to work his craft.It ain't very ship-shape to be sure, but anything of a seagoin' craftcomes more or less handy to an old salt."The trader listened with the politeness and profound gravity that seemsto be characteristic of Orientals, but by no sign or expression showedwhether he understood what was said."_I_ go to Zanzibar," said he, turning to Harold, "and will take you,--so you wish."There was something sinister in the man's manner which Harold did notlike, but as he was destitute, besides being in the Arab's power, andutterly ignorant of the country, he thought it best to put a good faceon matters, and therefore thanked him for his kind offer, and assuredhim that on reaching Zanzibar he would be in a position to pay for hispassage as well as that of his friend."May I ask," continued Harold, "what your occupation is?""I am trader."Harold thought he would venture another question:--"In what sort of goods do you trade?""Ivory.  Some be white, an' some be what your contrymans do call black.""Black!" exclaimed Harold, in surprise."Yees, black," replied the trader.  "White ivory do come from theelephant--hims tusk; Black Ivory do come,"--he smiled slightly at thispoint--"from the land everywheres.  It bees our chef artikil of trade.""Indeed!  I never heard of it before.""No?" replied the trader; "you shall see it much here.  But I go talkwith my mans.  Wait."Saying this, in a tone which savoured somewhat unpleasantly of command,the Arab went towards a small hut near to which his men were standing,and entered into conversation with them.It was evident that they were ill pleased with what he said at first forthere was a good deal of remonstrance in their tones, while they pointedfrequently in a certain direction which seemed to indicate thecoast-line; but by degrees their tones changed, and they laughed andchuckled a good deal, as if greatly tickled by the speech of the Arab,who, however, maintained a look of dignified gravity all the time."I don't like the looks o' them fellers," remarked Disco, afterobserving them in silence for some time.  "They're a cut-throat set, I'mquite sure, an' if you'll take my advice, Mister Seadrift, we'll give'em the slip, an' try to hunt up one o' the native villages.  Ishouldn't wonder, now, if that chap was a slave-trader.""The same idea has occurred to myself, Disco," replied Harold, "and Iwould willingly leave him if I thought there was a town or villagewithin twenty miles of us; but we are ignorant on that point and I haveheard enough of the African climate to believe that it might cost us ourlives if we were obliged to spend a night in the jungle without fire,food, or covering, and with nothing on but a wet flannel shirt and pairof canvas breeches.  No, no, lad, we must not risk it.  Besides,although some Arabs are slave-traders, it does not follow that all are.This fellow may turn out better than he looks."Disco Lillihammer experienced some sensations of surprise on hearing hisyoung friend's remarks on the climate, for he knew nothing whateverabout that of Africa, having sailed chiefly in the Arctic Seas as awhaler,--and laboured under the delusion that no climate under the suncould in any degree affect his hardy and well-seasoned frame.  He wastoo respectful, however, to let his thoughts be known.Meanwhile the Arab returned."I sail this night," he said, "when moon go down.  That not far beforemidnight.  You mus keep by boat here--close.  If you go this way or thatthe niggers kill you.  They not come _here_; they know I is here.  I golook after my goods and chattels--my Black Ivory.""Mayn't we go with 'ee, mister--what's your name?""My name?--Yoosoof," replied the Arab, in a tone and with a look whichwere meant to command respect."Well, Mister Yoosoof," continued Disco, "if we may make bold to axleave for to go with 'ee, we could lend 'ee a helpin' hand, d'ye see, tocarry yer goods an' chattels down to the boat.""There is no need," said Yoosoof, waving his hand, and pointing to thehut before mentioned.  "Go; you can rest till we sail.  Sleep; you willneed it.  There is littil rice in hut--eat that, and make fire, dryyouselfs."So saying, the Arab left them by a path leading into the woods, alongwhich his men, who were Portuguese half-castes, had preceded him."Make fire indeed!" exclaimed Disco, as he walked with his companion tothe hut; "one would think, from the free-and-easy way in which he tellsus to make it, that he's in the habit himself of striking it out o' thepoint o' his own nose, or some such convenient fashion.""More likely to flash it out of his eyes, I should think," said Harold;"but, see here, the fellow knew what he was talking about.  There isfire among these embers on the hearth.""That's true," replied Disco, going down on his knees, and blowing themcarefully.In a few minutes a spark leaped into a flame, wood was heaped on, andthe flame speedily became a rousing fire, before which they dried theirgarments, while a pot of rice was put on to boil.Scarcely had they proceeded thus far in their preparations, when twomen, armed with muskets, were seen to approach, leading a negro girlbetween them.  As they drew nearer, it was observable that the girl hada brass ring round her neck, to which a rope was attached."A slave!" exclaimed Disco vehemently, while the blood rushed to hisface; "let's set her free!"The indignant seaman had half sprung to his legs before Harold seizedand pulled him forcibly back."Be quiet man," said Harold quickly.  "If we _could_ free her byfighting, I would help you, but we can't.  Evidently we have got into anest of slavers.  Rashness will only bring about our own death.  Bewise; bide your time, and we may live to do some good yet."He stopped abruptly, for the new comers had reached the top of thewinding path that led to the hut.A look of intense surprise overspread the faces of the two men when theyentered and saw the Englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire, andboth, as if by instinct threw forward the muzzles of their muskets."Oh! come in, come in, make your minds easy," cried Disco, in ahalf-savage tone, despite the warning he had received; "we're all_friends_ here--leastwise we can't help ourselves."Fortunately for our mariner the men did not understand him, and beforethey could make up their minds what to think of it, or how to act Haroldrose, and, with a polite bow, invited them to enter."Do you understand English?" he asked.A frown, and a decided shake of the head from both men, was the reply.The poor negro girl cowered behind her keepers, as if she feared thatviolence were about to ensue.Having tried French with a like result, Harold uttered the name,"Yoosoof," and pointed in the direction in which the trader had enteredthe woods.The men looked intelligently at each other, and nodded.Then Harold said "Zanzibar," and pointed in the direction in which hesupposed that island lay.Again the men glanced at each other, and nodded.  Harold next said"Boat--dhow," and pointed towards the creek, which remark and sign werereceived as before."Good," he continued, slapping himself on the chest, and pointing to hiscompanion, "_I_ go to Zanzibar, _he_ goes, _she_ goes," (pointing to thegirl), "_you_ go, and Yoosoof goes--all in the dhow together toZanzibar--to-night--when moon goes down.  D'ee understand?  Now then,come along and have some rice."He finished up by slapping one of the men on the shoulder, and liftingthe kettle off the fire, for the rice had already been cooked and onlywanted warming.The men looked once again at each other, nodded, laughed, and sat downon a log beside the fire, opposite to the Englishmen.They were evidently much perplexed by the situation, and, not knowingwhat to make of it, were disposed in the meantime to be friendly.While they were busy with the rice, Disco gazed in silent wonder, andwith intense pity, at the slave-girl, who sat a little to one side ofher guardians on a mat, her small hands folded together resting on oneknee, her head drooping, and her eyes cast down.  The enthusiastic tarfound it very difficult to restrain his feelings.  He had heard, ofcourse, more or less about African slavery from shipmates, but he hadnever read about it, and had never seriously given his thoughts to it,although his native sense of freedom, justice, and fair-play had rouseda feeling of indignation in his breast whenever the subject chanced tobe discussed by him and his mates.  But now, for the first time in hislife, suddenly and unexpectedly, he was brought face to face withslavery.  No wonder that he was deeply moved."Why, Mister Seadrift," he said, in the confidential tone of one whoimparts a new discovery, "I do honestly confess to 'ee that I thinkthat's a _pretty_ girl!""I quite agree with you," replied Harold, smiling."Ay, but I mean _really_ pretty, you know.  I've always thought that allniggers had ugly flat noses an' thick blubber lips.  But look at thatone: her lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a good-lookinglass in England, and they don't stick out at all, and her nose ain'tflat a bit.  It's quite as good as my Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' agood deal, _I_ tell 'ee.  Moreover, she ain't black--she's brown."It is but justice to Disco to say that he was right in his observations,and to explain that the various negro tribes in Africa differ verymaterially from each other; some of them, as we are told by DrLivingstone, possessing little of what, in our eyes, seems thecharacteristic ugliness of the negro--such as thick lips, flat noses,protruding heels, etcetera,--but being in every sense handsome races ofhumanity.The slave-girl whom Disco admired and pitied so much belonged to one ofthese tribes, and, as was afterwards ascertained, had been brought fromthe far interior.  She appeared to be very young, nevertheless there wasa settled expression of meek sorrow and suffering on her face; andthough handsomely formed, she was extremely thin, no doubt fromprolonged hardships on the journey down to the coast."Here, have somethin' to eat," exclaimed Disco, suddenly filling a tinplate with rice, and carrying it to the girl, who, however, shook herhead without raising her eyes."You're not hungry, poor thing," said the seaman, in a disappointedtone; "you look as if you should be.  Come, try it," he added, stooping,and patting her head.The poor child looked up as if frightened, and shrank from the seaman'stouch, but on glancing a second time in his honest face, she appeared tofeel confidence in him.  Nevertheless, she would not touch the riceuntil her guardians said something to her sternly, when she began to eatwith an appetite that was eloquent."Come, now, tell us what your name is, lass," said Disco, when she hadfinished the rice.Of course the girl shook her head, but appeared to wish to understandthe question, while the Portuguese laughed and seemed amused with theEnglishman's eccentricities."Look here, now," resumed the tar, slapping his own chest vigorously,"Disco, Disco, Disco, that's me--Disco.  And this man," (patting hiscompanion on the breast) "is Harold, Harold, that's him--Harold.  Now,then," he added, pointing straight at the girl, "you--what's you name,eh?"A gleam of intelligence shot from the girl's expressive eyes, and shedisplayed a double row of beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice shesaid--"Azinte.""Azinte? come, that's not a bad name; why, it's a capital one.  Justsuited to 'ee.  Well, Azinte, my poor girl," said Disco, with a freshoutburst of feeling, as he clenched his horny right hand and dashed itinto the palm of his left, "if I only knew how to set you free just now,my dear, I'd do it--ay, if I was to be roasted alive for so doin'.  Iwould!""You'll never set anybody free in this world," said Harold Seadrift,with some severity, "if you go on talking and acting as you have doneto-day.  If these men had not, by good fortune, been ignorant of ourlanguage, it's my opinion that they would have blown our brains outbefore this time.  You should restrain yourself, man," he continued,gradually dropping into a remonstrative and then into an earnestlyconfidential tone; "we are utterly helpless just now.  If you didsucceed in freeing that girl at this moment, it would only be to let herfall into the hands of some other slave-owner.  Besides, that would notset free all the other slaves, male and female, who are being draggedfrom the interior of Africa.  You and I _may_ perhaps do some smallmatter in the way of helping to free slaves, if we keep quiet and watchour opportunity, but we shall accomplish nothing if you give way touseless bursts of anger."Poor Lillihammer was subdued."You're right Mister Seadrift, you're right, sir, and I'm a ass.  Inever _could_ keep my feelings down.  It's all along of my havin' binmade too much of by my mother, dear old woman, w'en I was a boy.  ButI'll make a effort, sir; I'll clap a stopper on 'em--bottle 'em up andscrew 'em down tight, werry tight indeed."Disco again sent his right fist into the palm of his left hand, withsomething like the sound of a pistol-shot to the no small surprise andalarm of the Portuguese, and, rising, went out to cool his heated browin the open air.CHAPTER TWO.YOOSOOF'S "BLACK IVORY."When Yoosoof entered the woods, as before stated, for the purpose oflooking after his property, he followed a narrow footpath for about halfa mile, which led him to another part of the same creek, at the entranceof which we introduced him to the reader.  Here, under the deep shadowof umbrageous trees, floated five large Arab boats, or dhows, similar tothe one which has been already referred to.  They were quite empty, andapparently unguarded, for when Yoosoof went down the bank and stood on aprojecting rock which overlooked them, no one replied to his low-tonedhail.  Repeating it once, and still receiving no answer, he sat quietlydown on the rocks, lighted a small pipe, and waited patiently.The boats, as we have said, were empty, but there were some curiousappliances in them, having the appearance of chains, and wristlets, andbars of iron running along and fixed to their decks, or rather to theflooring of their holds.  Their long yards and sails were cleared andready for hoisting.After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes, Yoosoof raised his head--forhe had been meditating deeply, if one might judge from his attitude--andglanced in the direction of an opening in the bushes whence issued asilent and singular train of human beings.  They were negroes, securedby the necks or wrists--men, women, and children,--and guarded by armedhalf-caste Portuguese.  When a certain number of them, about a hundredor so, had issued from the wood, and crowded the banks of the creek,they were ordered to stand still, and the leader of the band advancedtowards his master.These were some of Yoosoof's "goods and chattels," his "cattle," his"black ivory.""You have been long in coming, Moosa," said the Arab trader, as the manapproached."I have," replied Moosa, somewhat gruffly, "but the road was rough andlong, and the cattle were ill-conditioned, as you see."The two men spoke in the Portuguese tongue, but as the natives andsettlers on that coast speak a variety of languages and dialects, wehave no alternative, good reader, but to render all into English."Make the more haste now," said Yoosoof; "get them shipped at once, forwe sail when the moon goes down.  Pick out the weakest among the lot,those most likely to die, and put them by themselves in the small dhow.If we _must_ sacrifice some of our wares to these meddling dogs theEnglish, we may as well give them the refuse."Without remark, Moosa turned on his heel and proceeded to obey orders.Truly, to one unaccustomed to such scenes, it would have appeared thatall the negroes on the spot were "most likely to die," for a morewretched, starved set of human beings could scarcely be imagined.  Theyhad just terminated a journey on foot of several hundreds of miles, withinsufficient food and under severe hardships.  Nearly all of them werelean to a degree,--many so reduced that they resembled nothing butskeletons with a covering of black leather.  Some of the children werevery young, many of them mere infants, clinging to the backs of the poormothers, who had carried them over mountain and plain, through swamp andjungle, in blistering sunshine and pelting rain for many weary days.But prolonged suffering had changed the nature of these little ones.They were as silent and almost as intelligently anxious as theirseniors.  There were no old pieces of merchandise there.  Most wereyouthful or in the prime of life; a few were middle-aged.Difficult though the task appeared to be, Moosa soon selected aboutfifty men and women and a few children, who were so fearfully emaciatedthat their chance of surviving appeared but small.  These were castloose and placed in a sitting posture in the hold of the smallest dhow,as close together as they could be packed.Their removal from the bank made room for more to issue from the wood,which they did in a continuous stream.  Batch after batch was cast looseand stowed away in the manner already described, until the holds of twoof the large boats were filled, each being capable of containing abouttwo hundred souls.  This was so far satisfactory to Yoosoof, who hadexpended a good deal of money on the venture--satisfactory, evenalthough he had lost a large proportion of the goods--four-fifths atleast if not more, by death and otherwise, on the way down to the coast;but that was a matter of little consequence.  The price of black ivorywas up in the market just at that time, and the worthy merchant couldstand a good deal of loss.The embarkation was effected with wonderful celerity, and in comparativesilence.  Only the stern voices of the half-caste Portuguese were heardas they ordered the slaves to move, mingled with the occasional clank ofa chain, but no sounds proceeded from the thoroughly subdued andworn-out slaves louder than a sigh or a half-suppressed wail, with nowand then a shriek of pain when some of the weaker among them werequickened into activity by the lash.When all had been embarked, two of the five boats still remained empty,but Yoosoof had a pretty good idea of the particular points along thecoast where more "cattle" of a similar kind could be purchased.Therefore, after stationing some of his men, armed with muskets, toguard the boats, he returned with the remainder of them to the hut inwhich the Englishmen had been left.There he found Azinte and her guardians.  He seemed angry with thelatter at first, but after a few minutes' thought appeared to recoverhis equanimity, and ordered the men to remove the ropes with which thegirl was tethered; then bidding her follow him he left the hut withouttaking any notice of the Englishmen further than to say he would be backshortly before the time of sailing.Yoosoof's motions were usually slow and his mien somewhat dignified,but, when occasion required, he could throw off his Oriental dignity andstep out with the activity of a monkey.  It was so on this occasion,insomuch that Azinte was obliged occasionally to run in order to keep upwith him.  Proceeding about two miles in the woods along the shorewithout halt, he came out at length on the margin of a bay, at the headof which lay a small town.  It was a sorry-looking place, composed ofwretchedly built houses, most of which were thatched with the leaves ofthe cocoa-nut palm.Nevertheless, such as it was, it possessed a mud fort, an army of aboutthirty soldiers, composed of Portuguese convicts who had been sent thereas a punishment for many crimes, a Governor, who was understood to behonourable, having been placed there by his Excellency theGovernor-General at Mozambique, who had been himself appointed by HisMost Faithful Majesty the King of Portugal.It was in quest of this Governor that Yoosoof bent his rapid steps.Besides all the advantages above enumerated, the town drove a smalltrade in ivory, ebony, indigo, orchella weed, gum copal, cocoa-nut oil,and other articles of native produce, and a very large (though secret)trade in human bodies and--we had almost written--souls, but the worthypeople who dwelt there could not fetter souls, although they could, andvery often did, set them free.Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, the Governor, wasseated at the open window of his parlour, just before Yoosoof made hisappearance, conversing lightly with his only daughter, the SenhorinaMaraquita, a beautiful brunette of about eighteen summers, who had beenbrought up and educated in Portugal.The Governor's wife had died a year before this time in Madrid, and theSenhorina had gone to live with her father on the east coast of Africa,at which place she had arrived just six weeks previous to the date ofthe opening of our tale.Among the various boats and vessels at anchor in the bay, were seen thetapering masts of a British war-steamer.  The Senhorina and her sirewere engaged in a gossiping criticism of the officers of this vesselwhen Yoosoof was announced.  Audience was immediately granted.Entering the room, with Azinte close behind him, the Arab stoppedabruptly on beholding Maraquita, and bowed gravely."Leave us, my child," said the Governor, in Portuguese; "I have businessto transact with this man.""And why may not I stay to assist you, father, in this wonderfulman-mystery of transacting business?" asked Maraquita, with an archsmile."Whenever you men want to get rid of women you frighten them away with_business_!  If you wish not to explain something to us, you shake yourwise heads, and call it _business_!  Is it not so?--Come, Arab," sheadded, turning with a sprightly air to Yoosoof, "you are a trader, Isuppose; all Arabs are, I am told.  Well, what sort of wares have yougot to sell?"Yoosoof smiled slightly as he stepped aside and pointed to Azinte.The speaking countenance of the Portuguese girl changed as if by magic.She had seen little and thought little about slavery during the briefperiod of her residence on the coast, and had scarcely realised the factthat Sambo, with the thick lips--her father's gardener--or the blackcook and house-maids, were slaves.  It was the first entrance of a newidea with something like power into her mind when she saw a delicate,mild-looking, and pretty negro girl actually offered for sale.Before she could bethink herself of any remark the door opened, and inwalked, unannounced, a man on whose somewhat handsome countenancevillainy was clearly stamped."Ha!  Marizano," exclaimed Senhor Letotti, rising, "you have thoughtbetter of it, I presume?""I have, and I agree to your arrangement," replied Marizano, in anoff-hand, surly tone."There is nothing like necessity," returned the Governor, with a laugh."'Twere better to enjoy a roving life for a short time with a lightishpurse in one's pocket, than to attempt to keep a heavy purse with theaddition of several ounces of lead in one's breast!  How say you?"Marizano smiled and shrugged his broad shoulders, but made no reply, forjust then his attention had been attracted to the slave-girl."For sale?" he inquired of the Arab carelessly.Yoosoof bowed his head slightly."How much?""Come, come, gentlemen," interposed the Governor, with a laugh and aglance at his daughter, "you can settle this matter elsewhere.  Yoosoofhas come here to talk with me on other matters.--Now, Maraquita dear,you had better retire for a short time."When the Senhorina had somewhat unwillingly obeyed, the Governor turnedto Yoosoof: "I presume you have no objection to Marizano's presenceduring our interview, seeing that he is almost as well acquainted withyour affairs as yourself?"As Yoosoof expressed no objection, the three drew their chairs togetherand sat down to a prolonged private and very interesting palaver.We do not mean to try the reader's patience by dragging him through thewhole of it; nevertheless, a small portion of what was said is essentialto the development of our tale."Well, then, be it as you wish, Yoosoof," said the Governor, folding upa fresh cigarette; "you are one of the most active traders on the coast,and never fail to keep correct accounts with your Governor.  You deserveencouragement but I fear that you run considerable risk.""I know that; but those who make much must risk much.""Bravo!" exclaimed Marizano, with hearty approval; "nevertheless thosewho risk most do not always make most.  Contrast yourself with me, now.You risk your boats and cattle, and become rich.  I risk my life, andbehold!  I am fleeced.  I have little or nothing left, barely enough tobuy yonder girl from you--though I _think_ I have enough for that."He pointed as he spoke to Azinte, who still stood on the spot where shehad been left near the door."Tell me," resumed Senhor Letotti, "how do you propose to elude theEnglish cruiser? for I know that her captain has got wind of yourwhereabouts, and is determined to watch the coast closely--and let metell you, he is a vigorous, intelligent man.""You tell me he has a number of captured slaves already in his ship?"said Yoosoof."Yes, some hundreds, I believe.""He must go somewhere to land these, I presume?" rejoined the Arab.Yoosoof referred here to the fact that when a British cruiser engaged inthe suppression of the slave-trade on the east coast of Africa hascaptured a number of slaves, she is under the necessity of running tothe Seychelles Islands, Aden, or some other British port of discharge,to land them there as free men, because, were she to set them free onany part of the coast of Africa, belonging either to Portugal or theSultan of Zanzibar, they would certainly be recaptured and againenslaved.  When therefore the cruisers are absent--it may be two orthree weeks on this duty, the traders in human flesh of course make themost of their opportunity to run cargoes of slaves to those ports inArabia and Persia where they always find a ready market.On the present occasion Yoosoof conceived that the captain of the`Firefly' might be obliged to take this course to get rid of the negroesalready on board, who were of course consuming his provisions, besidesbeing an extremely disagreeable cargo, many of them being diseased andcovered with sores, owing to their cruel treatment on board theslave-dhows."He won't go, however, till he has hunted the coast north and south foryou, so he assures me," said the Governor, with a laugh."Well, I must start to-night, therefore I shall give him a small pill toswallow which will take him out of the way," said Yoosoof, rising toleave the room."I wish you both success," said the Governor, as Marizano also rose todepart, "but I fear that you will find the Englishman verytroublesome.--Adieu."The Arab and the half-caste went out talking earnestly together, andfollowed by Azinte, and immediately afterwards the Senhorina Maraquitaentered hurriedly."Father, you must buy that slave-girl for me.  I want a pretty slave allto myself," she said, with unwonted vehemence."Impossible, my child," replied the Governor kindly, for he was veryfond as well as proud of his daughter."Why impossible?  Have you not enough of money?""Oh yes, plenty of that, but I fear she is already bespoken, and Ishould not like to interfere--""Bespoken! do you mean sold?" cried Maraquita, seizing her father'shands, "not sold to that man Marizano?""I think she must be by this time, for he's a prompt man of business,and not easily thwarted when he sets his mind to a thing."The Senhorina clasped her hands before her eyes, and stood for a momentmotionless, then rushing wildly from the room she passed into anotherapartment the windows of which commanded a view of a considerable partof the road which led from the house along the shore.  There she saw theArab and his friend walking leisurely along as if in earnest converse,while Azinte followed meekly behind.The Senhorina stood gazing at them with clenched hands, in an agony ofuncertainty as to what course she ought to pursue, and so wrapt up inher thoughts that she failed to observe a strapping young lieutenant ofH.M.S. steamer `Firefly,' who had entered the room and stood close toher side.Now this same lieutenant happened to be wildly in love with SenhorinaMaraquita.  He had met her frequently at her father's table, where, incompany with his captain, he was entertained with great hospitality, andon which occasions the captain was assisted by the Governor in hisinvestigations into the slave-trade.Lieutenant Lindsay had taken the romantic plunge with all the charmingenthusiasm of inexperienced youth, and entertained the firm convictionthat, if Senhorina Maraquita did not become "his," life wouldthenceforth be altogether unworthy of consideration; happiness would bea thing of the past, with which he should have nothing more to do, anddeath at the cannon's mouth, or otherwise, would be the only remaininggleam of comfort in his dingy future."Something distresses you, I fear," began the lieutenant, not a littleperplexed to find the young lady in such a peculiar mood.Maraquita started, glanced at him a moment, and then, with flashing eyesand heightened colour, pointed at the three figures on the road."Yes, Senhor," she said; "I am distressed--deeply so.  Look! do you seeyonder two men, and the girl walking behind them?""I do.""Quick! fly after them and bring them hither--the Arab and the girl Imean--not the other man.  Oh, be quick, else they will be out of sightand then she will be lost; quick, if you--if--if you really mean whatyou have so often told me."Poor Lindsay!  It was rather a sudden and severe test of fidelity to besent forth to lay violent hands on a man and woman and bring themforcibly to the Governor's house, without any better reason than that aself-willed girl ordered him so to do; at the same time, he perceivedthat, if he did not act promptly, the retreating figures would soon turninto the town, and be hopelessly beyond his power of recognition."But--but--" he stammered, "if they won't come--?""They _must_ come.  Threaten my father's high displeasure.--Quick,Senhor," cried the young lady in a commanding tone.Lindsay flung open the casement and leapt through it as being theshortest way out of the house, rushed with undignified speed along theroad, and overtook the Arab and his friend as they were about to turninto one of the narrow lanes of the town."Pardon me," said the lieutenant laying his hand on Yoosoof's shoulderin his anxiety to make sure of him, "will you be so good as to returnwith me to the Governor's residence?""By whose orders?" demanded Yoosoof with a look of surprise."The orders of the Senhorina Maraquita."The Arab hesitated, looked somewhat perplexed, and said something inPortuguese to Marizano, who pointed to the slave-girl, and spoke withconsiderable vehemence.Lindsay did not understand what was said, but, conjecturing that thehalf-caste was proposing that Azinte should remain with him, hesaid:--"The girl must return with you--if you would not incur theGovernor's displeasure."Marizano, on having this explained to him, looked with much ferocity atthe lieutenant and spoke to Yoosoof in wrathful tones, but the lattershook his head, and the former, who disliked Marizano's appearanceexcessively, took not the least notice of him."I do go," said Yoosoof, turning back.  Motioning to Azinte to follow,he retraced his steps with the lieutenant and the slave--while Marizanostrode into the town in a towering rage.We need scarcely say that Maraquita, having got possession of Azinte,did not find it impossible to persuade her father to purchase her, andthat Yoosoof, although sorry to disappoint Marizano, who was animportant ally and assistant in the slave-trade, did not see his way tothwart the wishes of the Governor, whose power to interfere with histrade was very great indeed, and to whom he was under the necessity ofpaying head-money for every slave that was exported by him from thatpart of the coast.Soon after Azinte had been thus happily rescued from the clutches of twoof the greatest villains on the East African coast--where villains ofthe deepest dye are by no means uncommon--Lindsay met Captain Romer ofthe `Firefly' on the beach, with his first lieutenant Mr Small, who, bythe way, happened to be one of the largest men in his ship.  The threeofficers had been invited to dine that day with the Governor, and asthere seemed no particular occasion for their putting to sea that night,and a fresh supply of water had to be taken on board, the invitation hadbeen accepted, all the more readily, too, that Captain Romer thought itafforded an opportunity for obtaining further information as to themovements of certain notorious slavers who were said to be thereaboutsat that time.  Lieutenant Lindsay had been sent ashore at an earlierpart of the day, accompanied by one of the sailors who understoodPortuguese, and who, being a remarkably intelligent man, might, it wasthought, acquire some useful information from some of the people of thetown."Well, Mr Lindsay, has Jackson been of any use to you?" inquired thecaptain."Not yet," replied the lieutenant; "at least I know not what he may havedone, not having met him since we parted on landing; but I have myselfbeen so fortunate as to rescue a slave-girl under somewhat peculiarcircumstances.""Truly, a most romantic and gallant affair," said the captain, laughing,when Lindsay had related the incident, "and worthy of being mentioned indespatches; but I suspect, considering the part that the SenhorinaMaraquita played in it and the fact that you only rescued the girl fromone slaveholder in order to hand her over to another, the less that issaid about the subject the better!--But here comes Jackson.  Perhaps hemay have learned something about the scoundrels we are in search of."The seaman referred to approached and touched his cap."What news?" demanded the captain, who knew by the twinkle in Jack's eyethat he had something interesting to report."I've diskivered all about it sir," replied the man, with anill-suppressed chuckle."Indeed! come this way.  Now, let's hear what you have to tell," saidthe captain, when at a sufficient distance from his boat to render theconversation quite private."Well, sir," began Jackson, "w'en I got up into the town, arter leavin'Mr Lindsay, who should I meet but a man as had bin a messmate o' mineaboard of that there Portuguese ship w'ere I picked up a smatterin' o'the lingo?  Of course we hailed each other and hove-to for a spell, andthen we made sail for a grog-shop, where we spliced the main-brace.After a deal o' tackin' and beatin' about, which enabled me to find outthat he'd left the sea an' taken to business on his own account, whichin them parts seems to mean loafin' about doin' little or nothin', Iwent slap into the subject that was uppermost in my mind, and says I tohim, says I, they does a deal o' slavin' on this here coast, itappears--Black Ivory is a profitable trade, ain't it?  W'y, sir, youshould have seen the way he grinned and winked, and opened out on'em.--`Black Ivory!' says he, `w'y, Jackson, there's more slavesexported from these here parts annooally than would fill a good-sizedcity.  I could tell you--but,' says he, pullin' up sudden, `you won'tsplit on me, messmate?'  `Honour bright,' says I, `if ye don't calltellin' my captain splittin'.'  `Oh no,' says he, with a laugh, `it'slittle I care what _he_ knows, or does to the pirates--for that's theirtrue name, and murderers to boot--but don't let it come to theGovernor's ears, else I'm a ruined man.'  I says I wouldn't and then hegoes on to tell me all sorts of hanecdots about their doin's--that theydoes it with the full consent of the Governor, who gets head-money forevery slave exported; that nearly all the Governors on the coast arebirds of the same feather, and that the Governor-General himself, [SeeConsul McLeod's _Travels in Eastern Africa_, volume one page 306.] atMozambique, winks at it and makes the subordinate Governors pay himtribute.  Then he goes on to tell me more about the Governor of thishere town, an' says that, though a kind-hearted man in the main, andvery good to his domestic slaves, he encourages the export trade,because it brings him in a splendid revenue, which he has much need of,poor man, for like most, if not all, of the Governors on the coast, hedo receive nothin' like a respectible salary from the PortugueseGovernment at home, and has to make it up by slave-tradin'."  [SeeMcLeod's _Travels_, volume one page 293.]It must be explained here that British cruisers were, and still are,kept on the east coast of Africa, for the purpose of crushing only the_export_ slave-trade.  They claim no right to interfere with "domesticslavery," an institution which is still legal in the dominions of theSultan of Zanzibar and in the so-called colonies of Portugal on thatcoast."But that is not the best of it, sir," continued Jackson, with arespectful smile, "after we'd had our jaw out I goes off along the roadby the beach to think a bit what I'd best do, an' have a smoke--forthat's wot usually sets my brain to work full-swing.  Bein' hot I laydown in the lee of a bush to excogitate.  You see, sir, my old messmatetold me that there are two men here, the worst characters he everknow'd--ashore or afloat.  One they calls Yoosoof--an Arab he is; theother Marizano--he's a slave-catcher, and an outlaw just now, havin'taken up arms and rebelled against the Portuguese authorities.Nevertheless these two men are secretly hand and glove with the Governorhere, and at this moment there are said to be a lot o' slaves ready forshipment and only waitin' till the `Firefly' is out of the way.  Morethan this my friend could not tell, so that's w'y I went toexcogitate.--I beg parding, sir, for being so long wi' my yarn, but Iain't got the knack o' cuttin' it short, sir, that's w'ere it is.""Never mind, lad; go on to the end of it," replied the captain.  "Didyou excogitate anything more?""I can't say as I did, sir, but it was cooriously enough excogitated_for_ me.  W'en I was lying there looking through the bush at the bay, Isees two men comin' along, arm in arm.  One of 'em was an Arab.  W'enthey was near I saw the Arab start; I thought he'd seen me, and didn'tlike me.  No more did I like him or his comrade.  However, I was wrong,for after whisperin' somethin' very earnest-like to his friend, wholaughed very much; but said nothin', they came and sat down not far fromthe bush where I lay.  Now, thinks I, it ain't pleasant to be aneavesdropper, but as I'm here to find out the secrets of villains, andas these two look uncommon like villains, I'll wait a bit; if theybroach business as don't consarn me or her Majesty the Queen, I'llsneeze an' let 'em know I'm here, before they're properly under weigh;but if they speaks of wot I wants to know, I'll keep quiet.  Well, sir,to my surprise, the Arab--he speaks in bad English, whereby I came tosuppose the other was an Englishman, but, if he is, the climate musthave spoiled him badly, for I never did see such a ruffian to look at.But he only laughed, and didn't speak, so I couldn't be sure.  Well, tocome to the pint, sir, the Arab said he'd got hold of two shipwreckedEnglishmen, whom he meant to put on board of his dhow, at that timelyin' up a river not three miles off, and full of slaves, take 'em offthe coast, seize 'em when asleep, and heave 'em overboard; the reasonbein' that he was afraid, if they was left ashore here, they'd discoverthe town, which they are ignorant of at present, and give the alarm toour ship, sir, an' so prevent him gettin' clear off, which he means toattempt about midnight just after the moon goes down."This unexpected information was very gratifying to Captain Romer, whoimmediately gave orders to get steam up and have everything in readinessto start the moment he should make his appearance on board, at the sametime enjoining absolute silence on his lieutenants and Jackson, who allreturned to the `Firefly,' chuckling inwardly.If they had known that the Arab's information, though partly true, was a_ruse_; that Jackson had indeed been observed by the keen-eyed Oriental,who had thereupon sat down purposely within earshot, and after awhispered hint to his companion, gave forth such information as would belikely to lead the British cruiser into his snares--speaking in badEnglish, under the natural impression that the sailor did not understandPortuguese, to the immense amusement of Marizano, who understood the_ruse_, though he did not understand a single word of what his companionsaid--had they known all this, we say, it is probable that they wouldhave chuckled less, and--but why indulge in probabilities when facts arebefore us?  The sequel will show that the best-laid plans may fail.CHAPTER THREE.RELATES THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF HAROLD AND DISCO, AND LIFTS THECURTAIN A LITTLE HIGHER IN REGARD TO THE SLAVE-TRADE.So Captain Romer and his lieutenants went to dine with the worthyGovernor Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, while Yoosoofreturned to the creek to carry out his deep-laid plans.In regard to the dinner, let it suffice to observe that it was good, andthat the Governor was urbane, hospitable, communicative, and every wayagreeable.  It is probable that if he had been trained in another sphereand in different circumstances he might have been a better man.  Asthings stood, he was unquestionably a pleasant one, and Captain Romerfound it hard to believe that he was an underhand schemer.Nothing could exceed the open way in which Senhor Letotti condemned theslave-trade, praised the English for their zeal in attempting tosuppress it, explained that the King of Portugal and the Sultan ofZanzibar were equally anxious for its total extinction, and assured hisguests that he would do everything that lay in his power to furthertheir efforts to capture the guilty kidnappers, and to free the poorslaves!"But, my dear sir," said he, at the conclusion of an emphaticdeclaration of sympathy, "the thing is exceedingly difficult.  You areaware that Arab traders swarm upon the coast, that they are recklessmen, who possess boats and money in abundance, that the trade is veryprofitable, and that, being to some extent real traders in ivory,palm-oil, indigo, and other kinds of native produce, these men have many_ruses_ and methods--what you English call dodges--whereby they candeceive even the most sharp-sighted and energetic.  The Arabs are smartsmugglers of negroes--very much as your people who live in the Scottishland are smart smugglers of the dew of the mountain--what your greatpoet Burns speaks much of--I forget its name--it is not easy to put themdown."After dinner, Senhor Letotti led the officers into his garden, andshowed them his fruit-trees and offices, also his domestic slaves, wholooked healthy, well cared for, and really in some degree happy.He did not, however, tell his guests that being naturally a humane man,his slaves were better treated than any other slaves in the town.  Hedid not remind them that, being slaves, they were his property, hisgoods and chattels, and that he possessed the right and the power toflay them alive if so disposed.  He did not explain that many in thetown _were_ so disposed; that cruelty grows and feeds upon itself; thatthere were ladies and gentlemen there who flogged their slaves--men,women, and children--nearly to the death; that one gentleman of anirascible disposition, when irritated by some slight oversight on thepart of the unfortunate boy who acted as his valet, could find no reliefto his feelings until he had welted him first into a condition ofunutterable terror, and then into a state of insensibility.  Neither didhe inform them that a certain lady in the town, who seemed at most timesto be possessed of a reasonably quiet spirit, was roused once to such adegree by a female slave that she caused her to be forcibly held, thrusta boiling hot egg into her mouth, skewered her lips together with asail-needle, and then striking her cheeks, burst the egg, and let thescalding contents run down her throat.  [See Consul McLeod's _Travels_,volume two page 32.]No, nothing of all this did the amiable Governor Letotti so much as hintat.  He would not for the world have shocked the sensibilities of hisguests by the recital of such cruelties.  To say truth, the worthy manhimself did not like to speak or think of them.  In this respect heresembled a certain class among ourselves, who, rather than submit to alittle probing of their feelings for a few minutes, would prefer to missthe chance of making an intelligently indignant protest against slavery,and would allow the bodies and souls of their fellow-men to continuewrithing in agony through all time.It was much more gratifying to the feelings of Senhor Letotti to conveyhis guests to the drawing-room, and there gratify their palates withexcellent coffee, while the graceful, and now clothed, Azinte brought aSpanish guitar to the Senhorina Maraquita, whose sweet voice sooncharmed away all thoughts of the cruel side of slavery.  But duty erelong stepped in to call the guests to other scenes."What a sweet girl the Senhorina is!" remarked Captain Romer, while onhis way to the beach."Ay, and what a pretty girl Azinte is, black though she be," observedLieutenant Small."Call her not black; she is brown--a brunette," said the captain."I wonder how _we_ should feel," said Lindsay, "if the tables wereturned, and _our_ women and children, with our stoutest young men, wereforcibly taken from us by thousands every year, and imported into Africato grind the corn and hoe the fields of the black man.  Poor Azinte!""Do you know anything of her history?" inquired Mr Small."A little.  I had some conversation in French with the Senhorina justbefore we left--""Yes, I observed that," interrupted the captain, with a quiet smile."And," continued Lindsay, "she told me that she had discovered, throughan interpreter, that the poor girl is married, and that her home is faraway in the interior.  She was caught, with many others, while outworking in the fields one day several months ago, by a party ofslave-traders, under an Arab named Yoosoof and carried off.  Her husbandwas absent at the time; her infant boy was with its grandmother in theirvillage, and she thinks may have escaped into the woods, but she has notseen any of them again since the day of her capture.""It is a sad case," said the captain, "and yet bad though it be, itmight be far worse, for Azinte's master and mistress are very kind,which is more than can be said of most slave-owners in this region."In a few minutes the captain's gig was alongside the "Firefly," and soonafterwards that vessel quietly put to sea.  Of course it was impossiblethat she should depart unobserved, but her commander took the precautionto run due south at first, exactly opposite to the direction of his truecourse, intending to make a wide sweep out to sea, and thus getunobserved to the northward of the place where the slaver's dhow wassupposed to be lying, in time to intercept it.Yoosoof, from a neighbouring height watched the manoeuvre, andthoroughly understood it.  When the vessel had disappeared into theshades of night that brooded over the sea, he smiled calmly, and in aplacid frame of mind betook himself to his lair in the creek beside themangrove trees.He found Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer in the hut, somewhatimpatient of his prolonged absence, and a dozen of his men lookingrather suspiciously at the strangers."Is all ready, Moosa?" he inquired of a powerful man, half-Portuguese,half-negro in appearance, who met him outside the door of the hut."All ready," replied the half-caste, in a gruff tone of voice, "but whatare you going to do with these English brutes?""Take them with us, of course," replied Yoosoof."For what end?""For our own safety.  Why, don't you see, Moosa, that if we had set themfree, they might have discovered the town and given information to thecruiser about us, which would have been awkward?  We might now, indeed,set them free, for the cruiser is gone, but I still have good reason forwishing to take them with me.  They think that we have but _one_ boat inthis creek, and I should like to make use of them for the purpose ofpropagating that false idea.  I have had the good luck while in the townto find an opportunity of giving one of the sailors of the cruiser alittle information as to my movements--some of it true, some of itfalse--which will perhaps do us a service."The Arab smiled slightly as he said this."Do these men know our trade?" asked Moosa."I think they suspect it," answered Yoosoof."And what if they be not willing to go with us?" demanded Moosa."Can twelve men not manage two?" asked the Arab.  Dark though the nighthad become by that time, there was sufficient light to gleam on theteeth that Moosa exposed on receiving this reply."Now, Moosa, we must be prompt," continued Yoosoof; "let some of you getround behind the Englishmen, and have the slave-chains handy.  Keep youreye on me while I talk with them; if they are refractory, a nod shall bethe signal."Entering the hut Yoosoof informed Harold that it was now time to setsail."Good, we are ready," said Harold, rising, "but tell me one thing beforemy comrade and I agree to go with you,--tell us honestly if you areengaged in the slave-trade."A slight smile curled the Arab's thin lip as he replied--"If I be aslave-trader, I cannot speak honestly, so you Engleesh think.  But I dotell you--yes, I am.""Then, I tell _you_ honestly," said Harold, "that I won't go with you.I'll have nothing to do with slavers.""Them's my sentiments to a tee," said Disco, with emphasis, thumping hisleft palm as usual with his right fist, by way of sheating his remarkhome--to use his own words."But you will both perish on this uninhabited coast," said Yoosoof."So be it," replied Harold; "I had rather run the risk of starving thantravel in company with slave-traders.  Besides, I doubt the truth ofwhat you say.  There must be several villages not very far off, if myinformation in regard to the coast be not altogether wrong."Yoosoof waited for no more.  He nodded to Moosa, who instantly threw anoose round Harold's arms, and drew it tight.  The same operation wasperformed for Disco, by a stout fellow who stood behind him, and almostbefore they realised what had occurred, they were seized by a number ofmen.It must not be supposed that two able-bodied Englishmen quietlysubmitted at once to this sort of treatment.  On the contrary, astruggle ensued that shook the walls of the little hut so violently asalmost to bring it down upon the heads of the combatants.  The instantthat Harold felt the rough clasp of Moosa's arms, he bent himselfforward with such force as to fling that worthy completely over hishead, and lay him flat on the floor, but two of the other slavers seizedHarold's arms, a third grasped him round the waist, and a fourth rapidlysecured the ropes that had been thrown around him.  Disco's mode ofaction, although somewhat different was quite as vigorous.  On beinggrasped he uttered a deep roar of surprise and rage, and, raising hisfoot, struck out therewith at a man who advanced to seize him in front.The kick not only tumbled the man over a low bench and drove his headagainst the wall, but it caused the kicker himself to recoil on his foesbehind with such force that they all fell on the floor together, when bytheir united weight the slavers managed to crush the unfortunate Disco,not, indeed, into submission, but into inaction.His tongue, however, not being tied, continued to pour forth somewhatpowerful epithets, until Harold very strongly advised him to cease."If you want to retain a whole skin," he said, "you had better keep aquiet tongue.""P'raps you're right sir," said Disco, after a moment's consideration,"but it ain't easy to shut up in the succumstances."After they had thoroughly secured the Englishmen, the traders led themdown the bank of the creek to the spot where the dhow was moored.  Inthe dark it appeared to Harold and his companion to be the same dhow,but this was not so.  The boat by which they had crossed the creek hadbeen removed up the water, and its place was now occupied by the dhowinto which had been put the maimed and worn-out slaves of the band whosearrival we have described.  The hold of the little vessel was very dark,nevertheless there was light enough to enable the Englishmen to guessthat the rows of black objects just perceptible within it were slaves.If they had entertained any uncertainty on this point, the odour thatsaluted them as they passed to the stern would have quickly dispelledtheir doubts.It was evident from the manner of the slavers that they did not now feardiscovery, because they talked loudly as they pushed off and rowed away.Soon they were out of the creek, and the roar of breakers was heard.Much caution was displayed in guiding the dhow through these, for thechannel was narrow, and darkness rendered its position almostindiscernible.  At last the sail was hoisted, the boat bent over to asmart breeze, and held away in a north-easterly direction.  As the nightwore on this breeze became lighter, and, most of the crew being asleep,deep silence prevailed on board the slave-dhow, save that, ever andanon, a pitiful wail, as of a sick child, or a convulsive sob, issuedfrom the hold.Harold and Disco sat beside each other in the stern, with an armedhalf-caste on each side, and Yoosoof in front.  Their thoughts were busyenough at first, but neither spoke to the other.  As the night advancedboth fell into an uneasy slumber.When Harold awoke, the grey dawn was beginning to break in the east andthere was sufficient light to render objects dimly visible.  At first hescarcely recollected where he was, but the pain caused by the ropes thatbound him soon refreshed his memory.  Casting his eyes quickly towardsthe hold, his heart sank within him at the sight he there beheld.Yoosoof's Black Ivory was not of the best quality, but there was a gooddeal of it, which rendered judicious packing necessary.  So many of hisgang had become worthless as an article of trade, through suffering onthe way down to the coast, that the boat could scarce contain them all.They were packed sitting on their haunches in rows each with his kneesclose to his chin, and all jammed so tightly together that none couldrise up or lie down.  Men, women, and little children sat in thisposition with an expression of indescribable hopelessness and apathy ontheir faces.  The infants, of which there were several, lay motionlesson their mothers' shrunken breasts.  God help them! they were indeedutterly worthless as pieces of merchandise.  The long journey and hardtreatment had worn all of them to mere skin and bone, and many weresuffering from bad sores caused by the slave-irons and the unmercifulapplication of the lash.  No one knew better than Yoosoof that this washis "damaged stock"--hopelessly damaged, and he meant to make the bestuse he could of it.The sun arose in all its splendour, and revealed more clearly to thehorrified Englishmen all the wretchedness of the hold, but for aconsiderable time they did not speak.  The circumstances in which theyfound themselves seemed to have bereft them of the faculty of speech.The morning advanced, and Yoosoof with his men, took a frugal breakfast,but they did not offer any to Harold or Disco.  As these unfortunateshad, however, supped heartily, they did not mind that.  So much couldnot have been said for the slaves.  They had received their last meal ofuncooked rice and water, a very insufficient one, about thirty-six hoursbefore, and as they watched the traders at breakfast, their glaring eyestold eloquently of their sufferings.Had these been Yoosoof's valuable stock, his undamaged goods, he wouldhave given them a sufficiency of food to have kept them up to conditionas long as he possessed them; but being what they were, a very littledrop of water and a few grains of raw rice at noon was deemed sufficientto prevent absolute starvation."How can you have the heart," said Harold at last turning to Yoosoof,"to treat these poor creatures so cruelly?"Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders."My fader treat them so; I follow my fader's footsteps.""But have you no pity for them?  Don't you think they have hearts andfeelings like ourselves?" returned Harold earnestly."No," replied the Arab coldly.  "They have no feelings.  Hard as thestone.  They care not for mother, or child, or husband.  Only brutes--cattle."Harold was so disgusted with this reply that he relapsed into silence.Towards the afternoon, while the dhow was running close in-shore, avessel hove in sight on the horizon.  A few minutes sufficed to showthat it was a steamer.  It was of course observed and closely watched bythe slave-dealers as well as by Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer,who became sanguinely hopeful that it might turn out to be a Britishman-of-war.  Had they known that Yoosoof was equally anxious and hopefulon that point they would have been much surprised; but the wily Arabpretended to be greatly alarmed, and when the Union Jack became clearlyvisible his excitement increased.  He gave some hurried orders to hismen, who laughed sarcastically as they obeyed them."Yoosoof," said Harold, with a slight feeling of exultation, "your plansseem about to miscarry!""No, they not miscarry yet," replied the Arab, with a grim smile."Tell me, Yoosoof," resumed Harold, prompted by strong curiosity, "whyhave you carried us off bound in this fashion?"Another smile, more grim than the former, crossed the Arab's visage ashe replied--"Me carry you off 'cause that sheep," pointing to thesteamer, "lie not two mile off, near to town of Governor Letotti, when Ifirst met you.  We not want you to let thems know 'bout us, so I carryyou off, and I bind you 'cause you strong.""Ha! that's plain and reasonable," returned Harold, scarce able torestrain a laugh at the man's cool impudence.  "But it would appear thatsome one else has carried the news; so, you see, you have been outwittedafter all.""Perhaps.  We shall see," replied the Arab, with something approachingto a chuckle.Altering the course of the boat, Yoosoof now ran her somewhat off theshore, as if with a view to get round a headland that lay to thenorthward.  This evidently drew the attention of the steamer--which wasnone other than the "Firefly"--for she at once altered her course andran in-shore, so as to intercept the dhow.  Seeing this, Yoosoof turnedback and made for the land at a place where there was a long line ofbreakers close to the shore.  To run amongst these seemed to beequivalent to running on certain destruction, nevertheless the Arab heldon, with compressed lips and a frowning brow.  Yoosoof looked quite likea man who would rather throw away his life than gratify his enemy, andthe Englishmen, who were fully alive to their danger, began to feelrather uneasy--which was a very pardonable sensation, when it isremembered that their arms being fast bound, rendered them utterlyunable to help themselves in case of the boat capsizing.The "Firefly" was by this time near enough to hold converse with thedhow through the medium of artillery.  Soon a puff of white smoke burstfrom her bow, and a round-shot dropped a few yards astern of the boat."That's a broad hint, my lad, so you'd better give in," saidLillihammer, scarce able to suppress a look of triumph.Yoosoof paid not the slightest attention to the remark, but held on hiscourse."Surely you don't intend to risk the lives of these poor creatures insuch a surf?" said Harold anxiously; "weak and worn as they are, theirdoom is sealed if we capsize."Still the Arab paid no attention, but continued to gaze steadily at thebreakers.Harold, turning his eyes in the same direction, observed something likea narrow channel running through them.  He was enough of a seaman tounderstand that only one who was skilled in such navigation could passin safety."They're lowering a boat," said Disco, whose attention was engrossed bythe manoeuvres of the "Firefly."Soon the boat left the side of the vessel, which was compelled to checkher speed for fear of running on the reef.  Another gun was fired as shecame round, and the shot dropped right in front of the dhow, sending acolumn of water high into the air.  Still Yoosoof held on until close tothe breakers, when, to the surprise of the Englishmen, he suddenly threwthe boat's head into the wind."You can steer," he said sternly to Disco.  "Come, take the helm an' goto your ship; or, if you choose, go on the breakers."He laughed fiercely as he said this, and next moment plunged into thesea, followed by his crew.Disco, speechless with amazement, rose up and sprang to the helm.  Ofcourse he could not use his bound hands, but one of his legs answeredalmost as well.  He allowed the boat to come round until the sail filledon the other tack, and then looking back, saw the heads of the Arabs asthey swam through the channel and made for the shore.  In a few minutesthey gained it, and, after uttering a shout of defiance, ran up into thebushes and disappeared.Meanwhile the "Firefly's" boat made straight for the dhow, and was soonnear enough to hail."Heave-to," cried an interpreter in Arabic."Speak your own mother tongue and I'll answer ye," replied Disco."Heave-to, or I'll sink you," shouted Mr Small, who was in charge."I'm just agoin' to do it, sir," replied Disco, running the dhow intothe wind until the sail shook.Another moment and the boat was alongside.  "Jump aboard and handle thesail, lads; I can't help 'ee no further," said Disco.The invitation was unnecessary.  The moment the two boats touched, theblue-jackets swarmed on board, cutlass in hand, and took possession."Why, what!--where did _you_ come from?" asked the lieutenant, lookingin profound astonishment at Harold and his companion."We are Englishmen, as you see," replied Harold, unable to restrain asmile; "we have been wrecked and caught by the villains who have justescaped you.""I see--well, no time for talking just now; cut them loose, Jackson.Make fast the sheet--now then."In a few minutes the dhow ranged up alongside the "Firefly," and ourheroes, with the poor slaves, were quickly transferred to theman-of-war's deck, where Harold told his tale to Captain Romer.As we have already stated, there were a number of slaves on board the"Firefly," which had been rescued from various Arab dhows.  The gang nowreceived on board made their numbers so great that it became absolutelynecessary to run to the nearest port to discharge them.We have already remarked on the necessity that lies on our cruisers,when overladen with rescued slaves, to run to a distant port ofdischarge to land them; and on the readiness of the slave-traders totake advantage of their opportunity, and run north with full cargoeswith impunity when some of the cruisers are absent; for it is notpossible for a small fleet to guard upwards of a thousand miles of coasteffectually, or even, in any degree, usefully.  If we possessed a portof discharge--a British station and settlement--on the mainland of theeast coast of Africa, this difficulty would not exist.  As it is,although we place several men-of-war on a station, the evil will not becured, for just in proportion as these are successful in makingcaptures, will arise the necessity of their leaving the station forweeks at a time unguarded.Thus it fell out on the occasion of which we write.  The presence of thelarge slave-freight on board the man-of-war was intolerable.  CaptainRomer was compelled to hurry off to the Seychelles Islands.  He sailedwith the monsoon, but had to steam back against it.  During this periodanother vessel, similarly freighted, had to run to discharge at Aden.The seas were thus comparatively clear of cruisers.  The Arabs seizedtheir opportunity, and a stream of dhows and larger vessels swept outfrom the various creeks and ports all along the East African coast,filled to overflowing with slaves.Among these were the four large dhows of our friend Yoosoof.  Having, aswe have seen, made a slight sacrifice of damaged and unsaleable goodsand chattels, in order to clear the way, he proceeded north, touching atvarious ports where he filled up his living cargo, and finally got clearoff, not with goods damaged beyond repair, but with thousands of thesons and daughters of Africa in their youthful prime.In the interior each man cost him about four yards of cotton cloth,worth a few pence; each woman three yards, and each child two yards, andof course in cases where he stole them, they cost him nothing.  On thecoast these would sell at from 8 pounds to 12 pounds each, and in Arabiaat from 20 pounds to 40 pounds.We mention this to show what strong inducement there was for Yoosoof torun a good deal of risk in carrying on this profitable and accursedtraffic.But you must not fancy, good reader, that what we have described isgiven as a specimen of the _extent_ to which the slave-trade on thatcoast is carried.  It is but as a specimen of the _manner_ thereof.  Itis certainly within the mark to say that at least thirty thousandnatives are annually carried away as slaves from the east coast ofAfrica.Sir Bartle Frere, in addressing a meeting of the chief nativeinhabitants of Bombay in April 1873, said,--"Let me assure you, inconclusion, that what you have heard of the horrors of the slave-tradeis in no way exaggerated.  We have seen so much of the horrors whichwere going on that we can have no doubt that what you read in books,which are so often spoken of as containing exaggerations, is exaggeratedin no respect.  The evil is much greater than anything you can conceive.Among the poorer class of Africans there is nothing like security fromfathers and mothers being put to death in order that their children maybe captured;"--and, referring to the _east coast alone_, he saysthat--"thirty thousand, or more, human beings, are exported every yearfrom Africa."Dr Livingstone tells us that, on the average, about one out of everyfive captured human beings reaches the coast alive.  The other fourperish or are murdered on the way, so that the thirty thousand annuallyexported, as stated by Sir Bartle Frere, represents a loss of 150,000human beings _annually_ from the east coast alone, altogetherirrespective of the enormous and constant flow of slaves to the north byway of the White Nile and Egypt.Yoosoof's venture was therefore but a drop in the vast river of bloodwhich is drained annually from poor Africa's veins--blood which flows atthe present time as copiously and constantly as it ever did in the daysof old--blood which cries aloud to God for vengeance, and for the flowof which _we_, as a nation, are far from blameless.CHAPTER FOUR.IN WHICH OUR HEROES SEE STRANGE SIGHTS AT ZANZIBAR, AND RESOLVE UPONTAKING A BOLD STEP.Before proceeding to the Seychelles, the `Firefly' touched at the islandof Zanzibar, and there landed our hero Harold Seadrift and his comradein misfortune, Disco Lillihammer.Here, one brilliant afternoon, the two friends sat down under apalm-tree to hold what Disco called a palaver.  The spot commanded afine view of the town and harbour of Zanzibar.We repeat that the afternoon was brilliant, but it is right to add thatit required an African body and mind fully to appreciate the pleasuresof it.  The sun's rays were blistering, the heat was intense, and theair was stifling.  Harold lay down and gasped, Disco followed hisexample, and sighed.  After a few minutes spent in a species of imbecilecontemplation of things in general, the latter raised himself to asitting posture, and proceeded slowly to fill and light his pipe.Harold was no smoker, but he derived a certain dreamy enjoyment fromgazing at Disco, and wondering how he could smoke in such hot weather."We'll get used to it I s'pose, like the eels," observed Disco, when thepipe was in full blast."Of course we shall," replied Harold; "and now that we have come to ananchor, let me explain the project which has been for some days maturingin my mind.""All right; fire away, sir," said the sailor, blowing a long thin cloudfrom his lips."You are aware," said Harold, "that I came out here as supercargo of myfather's vessel," (Disco nodded), "but you are not aware that my chiefobject in coming was to see a little of the world in general, and of theAfrican part of it in particular.  Since my arrival you and I have seena few things, which have opened up my mind in regard to slavery; we havenow been a fortnight in this town, and my father's agent has enlightenedme still further on the subject, insomuch that I now feel within me anintense desire to make an excursion into the interior of Africa; indeed,I have resolved to do so, for the purpose of seeing its capabilities ina commercial point of view, of observing how the slave-trade isconducted at its fountain-head, and of enjoying a little of the sceneryand the sport peculiar to this land of Ham.""W'y, you speaks like a book, sir," said Disco, emitting a prolongedpuff, "an' it ain't for the likes me to give an opinion on that there;but if I may make bold to ax, sir, how do you mean to travel--on theback of a elephant or a ry-noceris?--for it seems to me that there ain'tmuch in the shape o' locomotives or 'busses hereabouts--not even cabs.""I shall go in a canoe," replied Harold; "but my reason for broachingthe subject just now is, that I may ask if you are willing to go withme.""There's no occasion to ax that sir; I'm your man--north or south, eastor west, it's all the same to me.  I've bin born to roll about theworld, and it matters little whether I rolls ashore or afloat--though Iprefers the latter.""Well, then, that's settled," said Harold, with a look of satisfaction;"I have already arranged with our agent here to advance me what Irequire in the way of funds, and shall hire men and canoes when we getdown to the Zambesi--""The Zam-wot, sir?""The Zambesi; did you never hear of it before?""Never, nor don't know wot it is, sir.""It is a river; one of the largest on the east coast, which has beenwell described by Dr Livingstone, that greatest of travellers, whosechief object in travelling is, as he himself says, to raise the negroesout of their present degraded condition, and free them from the curse ofslavery.""That's the man to _my_ mind," said Disco emphatically; "good luck tohim.--But w'en d'you mean to start for the Zambizzy, sir?""In a few days.  It will take that time to get everything ready, and ourmoney packed.""Our money packed!" echoed the sailor, with a look of surprise, "w'y,wot d'ye mean!""Just what I say.  The money current in the interior of Africa is rathercumbrous, being neither more nor less than goods.  You'll never guesswhat sort--try.""Rum," said Disco."No.""Pipes and 'baccy."Harold shook his head."Never could guess nothin'," said Disco, replacing the pipe, which hehad removed for a few moments from his lips; "I gives it up.""What would you say to cotton cloth, and thick brass wire, and glassbeads, being the chief currency in Central Africa?" said Harold."You don't mean it, sir?""Indeed I do, and as these articles must be carried in large quantities,if we mean to travel far into the land, there will be more bales andcoils than you and I could well carry in our waistcoat pockets.""That's true, sir," replied Disco, looking earnestly at a couple ofnegro slaves who chanced to pass along the neighbouring footpath at thatmoment, singing carelessly.  "Them poor critters don't seem to be somiserable after all.""That is because the nigger is naturally a jolly, light-hearted fellow,"said Harold, "and when his immediate and more pressing troubles areremoved he accommodates himself to circumstances, and sings, as youhear.  If these fellows were to annoy their masters and get a thrashing,you'd hear them sing in another key.  The evils of most things don'tshow on the surface.  You must get behind the scenes to understand them.You and I have already had one or two peeps behind the scenes.""We have indeed, sir," replied Disco, frowning, and closing his fistsinvoluntarily, as he thought of Yoosoof and the dhow."Now, then," said Harold, rising, as Disco shook the ashes out of hislittle black pipe, and placed that beloved implement in the pocket ofhis coat, "let us return to the harbour, and see what chance there is ofgetting a passage to the Zambesi, in an honest trading dhow--if there issuch a thing in Zanzibar."On their way to the harbour they had to pass through the slave-market.This was not the first time they had visited the scene of thisiniquitous traffic, but neither Harold nor Disco could accustomthemselves to it.  Every time they entered the market their feelings ofindignation became so intense that it was with the utmost difficultythey could control them.  When Disco saw handsome negro men andgood-looking girls put up for public sale,--their mouths rudely opened,and their teeth examined by cool, calculating Arabs, just as if they hadbeen domestic cattle--his spirit boiled within him, his fingers tingled,and he felt a terrible inclination to make a wild attack, single-handed,on the entire population of Zanzibar, though he might perish in theexecution of vengeance and the relief of his feelings!  We need scarcelyadd that his discretion saved him.  They soon reached the small squarein which the market was held.  Here they saw a fine-looking young womansold to a grave elderly Arab for a sum equal to about eight poundssterling.  Passing hastily on, they observed another "lot," a tallstalwart man, having his various "points" examined, and stopped to seethe result.  His owner, thinking, perhaps, that he seemed a littlesluggish in his movements, raised his whip and caused it to fall uponhis flank with such vigour that the poor fellow, taken by surprise,leaped high into the air, and uttered a yell of pain.  The strength andactivity of the man were unquestionable, and he soon found a purchaser.But all the slaves were not fine-looking or stalwart like the two justreferred to.  Many of them were most miserable objects.  Some stood,others were seated as if incapable of standing, so emaciated were they.Not a few were mere skeletons, with life and skin.  Near the middle ofthe square, groups of children were arranged--some standing up to beinspected, others sitting down.  These ranged from five years andupwards, but there was not one that betrayed the slightest tendency tomirth, and Disco came to the conclusion that negro children do not play,but afterwards discovered his mistake, finding that their exuberantjollity "at home" was not less than that of the children of other lands.These little slaves had long ago been terrified, and beaten, andstarved into listless, apathetic and silent creatures.Further on, a row of young women attracted their attention.  They wereranged in a semicircle, all nearly in a state of nudity, waiting to besold.  A group of Arabs stood in front of them, conversing.  One ofthese women looked such a picture of woe that Disco felt irresistiblyimpelled to stop.  There were no tears in her eyes; the fountainappeared to have been dried up, but, apparently, without abating thegrief which was stamped in deep lines on her young countenance, andwhich burst frequently from her breast in convulsive sobs.  OurEnglishmen were not only shocked but surprised at this woman's aspect,for their experience had hitherto gone to show that the slaves usuallybecame callous under their sufferings.  Whatever of humanity might haveoriginally belonged to them seemed to have been entirely driven out ofthem by the cruelties and indignities they had so long suffered at thehands of their captors.  [See Captain Sulivan's _Dhow-chasing inZanzibar Waters_, page 252.]"Wot's the matter with her, poor thing?" asked Disco of a half-castePortuguese, dressed in something like the garb of a sailor."Oh, notting," answered the man in broken English, with a look ofindifference, "she have lose her chile, dat all.""Lost her child? how--wot d'ee mean?""Dey hab sole de chile," replied the man; "was good fat boy, 'bouttwo-yer ole.  S'pose she hab carry him for months troo de woods, an'over de hills down to coast, an' tink she keep him altogether.  But shemistake.  One trader come here 'bout one hour past.  He want boy--notwant modder; so he buy de chile.  Modder fight a littil at first, but deowner soon make her quiet.  Oh, it notting at all.  She cry a littil--soon forget her chile, an' get all right.""Come, I can't stand this," exclaimed Harold, hastening away.Disco said nothing, but to the amazement of the half-caste, he graspedhim by the collar, and hurled him aside with a degree of force thatcaused him to stagger and fall with stunning violence to the ground.Disco then strode away after his friend, his face and eyes blazing withvarious emotions, among which towering indignation predominated.In a few minutes they reached the harbour, and, while making inquiriesas to the starting of trading dhows for the south, they succeeded incalming their feelings down to something like their ordinary condition.The harbour was crowded with dhows of all shapes and sizes, most of themladen with slaves, some discharging cargoes for the Zanzibar market,others preparing to sail, under protection of a pass from the Sultan,for Lamoo, which is the northern limit of the Zanzibar dominions, and,therefore, of the so-called "domestic" slave-trade.There would be something particularly humorous in the barefacedness ofthis august Sultan of Zanzibar, if it were connected with anything lesshorrible than slavery.  For instance, there is something almost amusingin the fact that dhows were sailing every day for Lamoo with hundreds ofslaves, although that small town was known to be very much overstockedat the time.  It was also quite entertaining to know that the commandersof the French and English war-vessels lying in the harbour at the timewere aware of this, and that the Sultan knew it, and that, in short,everybody knew it, but that nobody appeared to have the power to preventit!  Even the Sultan who granted the permits or passes to the owners ofthe dhows, although he _professed_ to wish to check the slave-trade,could not prevent it.  Wasn't that strange--wasn't it curious?  TheSultan derived by far the largest portion of his revenue from the taxlevied on the export of slaves--amounting to somewhere about 10,000pounds a year--but _that_ had nothing to do with it of course not, ohdear no!  Then there was another very ludicrous phase of this oriental,not to say transcendental, potentate's barefacedness.  He knew, andprobably admitted, that about 2000, some say 4000, slaves a year weresufficient to meet the home-consumption of that commodity, and he alsoknew, but probably did not admit, that not fewer than 30,000 slaves wereannually exported from Zanzibar to meet this requirement of 4000!  Theseare very curious specimens of miscalculation which this barefaced Sultanseems to have fallen into.  Perhaps he was a bad arithmetician.  [SeeCaptain Sulivan's _Dhow-chasing in Zanzibar Water_; page 111.] We havesaid that this state of things _was_ so at the time of our story, but wemay now add that it still _is_ so in this year of grace 1873.  Whetherit shall continue to be so remains to be seen!Having spent some time in fruitless inquiry, Harold and Disco at last totheir satisfaction, discovered an Arab dhow of known good character,which was on the point of starting for the Zambesi in the course of afew days, for the purpose of legitimate traffic.  It therefore becamenecessary that our hero should make his purchases and preparations withall possible speed.  In this he was entirely guided by his father'sagent, a merchant of the town, who understood thoroughly what wasnecessary for the intended journey.It is not needful here to enter into full details, suffice it to saythat among the things purchased by Harold, and packed up in portableform, were a number of bales of common unbleached cotton, which isesteemed above everything by the natives of Africa as an article ofdress--if we may dignify by the name of dress the little piece, aboutthe size of a moderate petticoat, which is the only clothing of some, orthe small scrap round the loins which is the sole covering of other,natives of the interior!  There were also several coils of thick brasswire, which is much esteemed by them for making bracelets and anklets;and a large quantity of beads of various colours, shapes, and sizes.  Ofbeads, we are told, between five and six hundred tons are annuallymanufactured in Great Britain for export to Africa.Thus supplied, our two friends embarked in the dhow and set sail.  Windand weather were propitious.  In few days they reached the mouths of thegreat river Zambesi, and landed at the port of Quillimane.Only once on the voyage did they fall in with a British cruiser, whichordered them to lay-to and overhauled them, but on the papers andeverything being found correct, they were permitted to pursue theirvoyage.The mouths of the river Zambesi are numerous; extending over more thanninety miles of the coast.  On the banks of the northern mouth stands--it would be more appropriate to say festers--the dirty little Portuguesetown of Quillimane.  Its site is low, muddy, fever-haunted, and swarmingwith mosquitoes.  No man in his senses would have built a villagethereon were it not for the facilities afforded for slaving.  At springor flood tides the bar may be safely crossed by sailing vessels, but,being far from land, it is always dangerous for boats.Here, then, Harold and Disco landed, and remained for some time for thepurpose of engaging men.  Appearing in the character of independenttravellers, they were received with some degree of hospitality by theprincipal inhabitants.  Had they gone there as simple and legitimatetraders, every possible difficulty would have been thrown in their way,because the worthy people, from the Governor downwards, flourished,--orfestered,--by means of the slave-trade, and legitimate commerce iseverywhere found to be destructive to the slave-trade.Dr Livingstone and others tell us that thousands upon thousands ofnegroes have, of late years, gone out from Quillimane into slavery underthe convenient title of "free emigrants," their freedom being not quiteequal to that of a carter's horse, for while that animal, althoughenslaved, is usually well fed, the human animal is kept on rather lowdiet lest his spirit should rouse him to deeds of desperate violenceagainst his masters.  All agricultural enterprise is also effectuallydiscouraged here.  When a man wants to visit his country farm he has topurchase a permit from the Governor.  If he wishes to go up the river tothe Portuguese towns of Senna or Tette, a pass must be purchased fromthe Governor.  In fact it would weary the reader were we to enumeratethe various modes in which every effort of man to act naturally,legitimately, or progressively, is hampered, unless his business be thebuying and selling of human beings.At first Harold experienced great difficulty in procuring men.  Themaster of the trading dhow in which he sailed from Zanzibar intended toremain as short a time as possible at Quillimane, purposing to visitports further south, and as Harold had made up his mind not to enter theZambesi by the Quillimane mouth, but to proceed in the dhow to one ofthe southern mouths, he felt tempted to give up the idea of procuringmen until he had gone further south."You see, Disco," said he, in a somewhat disconsolate tone, "it won't doto let this dhow start without us, because I want to get down to theEast Luavo mouth of this river, that being the mouth which was latelydiscovered and entered by Dr Livingstone; but I'm not sure that we canprocure men or canoes there, and our Arab skipper either can't or won'tenlighten me.""Ah!" observed Disco, with a knowing look, "he won't--that's where itis, sir.  I've not a spark o' belief in that man, or in any Arab on thecoast.  He's a slaver in disguise, he is, an' so's every mother's son of'em.""Well," continued Harold, "if we must start without them and take ourchance, we must; there is no escaping from the inevitable; neverthelesswe must exert ourselves _to-day_, because the dhow does not sail tillto-morrow evening, and there is no saying what luck may attend ourefforts before that time.  Perseverance, you know, is the only suremethod of conquering difficulties.""That's so," said Disco; "them's my sentiments 'xactly.  Never say die--Stick at nothing--Nail yer colours to the mast: them's the mottoes thatI goes in for--always s'posin' that you're in the right.""But what if you're in the wrong, and the colours are nailed?" askedHarold, with a smile."W'y then, sir, of course I'd have to tear 'em down.""So that perhaps, it would be better not to nail them at all, unlessyou're very sure--eh?""Oh, of _course_, sir," replied Disco, with solemn emphasis.  "You don'tsuppose, sir, that I would nail 'em to the mast except I was sure, werysure, that I wos right?  But, as you wos a sayin', sir, about thegittin' of them 'ere men."Disco had an easy way of changing a subject when he felt that he wasgetting out of his depth."Well, to return to that.  The fact is, I would not mind the men, forit's likely that men of some sort will turn up somewhere, but I am veryanxious about an interpreter.  Without an interpreter we shall get onbadly, I fear, for I can only speak French, besides a very little Latinand Greek, none of which languages will avail much among niggers."Disco assumed a severely thoughtful expression of countenance."That's true," he said, placing his right fist argumentatively in hisleft palm, "and I'm afeard I can't help you there, sir.  If it wos tosteer a ship or pull a oar or man the fore-tops'l yard in a gale o'wind, or anything else in the seafarin' line, Disco Lillihammer's yourman, but I couldn't come a furrin' lingo at no price.  I knows nothin'but my mother tongue,--nevertheless, though I says it that shouldn't, Idoes profess to be somewhat of a dab at that.  Once upon a time I spentsix weeks in Dublin, an' havin' a quick ear for moosic, I soon managedto get up a strong dash o' the brogue; but p'raps that wouldn't go farwith the niggers."About two hours after the above conversation, while Harold Seadrift waswalking on the beach, he observed his faithful ally in the distancegrasping a short thickset man by the arm, and endeavouring to induce himto accompany him, with a degree of energy that fell little short of mainforce.  The man was evidently unwilling.As the pair drew nearer, Harold overheard Disco's persuasivevoice:--"Come now, Antonio, don't be a fool; it's the best service youcould enter.  Good pay and hard work, and all the grub that's goin'--what could a man want more?  It's true there's no grog, but we don'tneed that in a climate where you've only got to go out in the sunwithout yer hat an' you'll be as good as drunk in ten minutes, any day.""No, no, not possibil," remonstrated the man, whose swarthy visagebetrayed a mixture of cunning, fun, and annoyance.  He was obviously ahalf-caste of the lowest type, but with more pretensions to wealth thanmany of his fellows, inasmuch as he wore, besides his loin-cloth, awhite cotton shooting-coat, very much soiled, beneath the tails of whichhis thin black legs protruded ridiculously."Here you are, sir," cried Disco, as he came up; "here's the man forlingo: knows the native talkee, as well as Portuguese, English, Arabic,and anything else you like, as far as I know.  Antonio's his name.Come, sir, try him with Greek, or somethin' o' that sort!"Harold had much ado to restrain a smile, but, assuming a grave aspect,he addressed the man in French, while Disco listened with a look ofprofound respect and admiration."W'y, wot's wrong with 'ee, man," exclaimed Disco, on observing theblank look of Antonio's countenance; "don't 'ee savay that?""I thought you understood Portuguese?" said Harold in English."So me do," replied Antonio quickly; "but dat no Portigeese--datSpanaish, me 'spose.""What _can_ you speak, then?" demanded Harold sternly."Portigeese, Arbik, Fengleesh, an' two, tree, four, nigger lungwiches."It was very obvious that, whatever Antonio spoke, he spoke nothingcorrectly, but that was of no importance so long as the man could makehimself understood.  Harold therefore asked if he would join his partyas interpreter, but Antonio shook his head."Why not man--why not?" asked Harold impatiently, for he became anxiousto secure him, just in proportion as he evinced disinclination toengage."Speak up, Antonio, don't be ashamed; you've no need to," said Disco."The fact is, sir, Antonio tells me that he has just bin married, an' hedon't want to leave his wife.""Very natural," observed Harold.  "How long is it since you weremarried?""Von veek since I did bought her.""Bought her!" exclaimed Disco, with a broad grin; "may I ax wot ye paidfor her?""Paid!" exclaimed the man, starting and opening his eyes very wide, asif the contemplation of the vast sum were too much for him; "lat mezee--me pay me vife's pairyints sixteen yard ob cottin clothe, an' forme's hut four yard morer.""Ye don't say that?" exclaimed Disco, with an extended grin.  "Is sheyoung an' good-lookin'?""Yonge!" replied Antonio; "yis, ver' yonge; not mush more dan baby, an'exiquitely bootiful.""Then, my good feller," said Disco, with a laugh, "the sooner you leaveher the better.  A week is a long time, an' absence, you know, as theold song says, makes the heart grow fonder; besides, Mr Seadrift willgive you enough to buy a dozen wives, if 'ee want 'em.""Yes, I'll pay you well," said Harold; "that is, if you prove to be agood interpreter."Antonio pricked up his ears at this."How mush vill 'oo gif?" he asked."Well, let me think; I shall probably be away three or four months.What would you say, Antonio, to twenty yards of cotton cloth a month,and a gun into the bargain at the end, if you do your work well?"The pleased expression of Antonio's face could not have been greater hadhe been offered twenty pounds sterling a month.  The reader may estimatethe value of this magnificent offer when we say that a yard of cottoncloth was at that time sevenpence-halfpenny, so that Antonio's valuableservices were obtained for about 12 shillings, 6 pence a month, and agun which cost Harold less than twenty shillings in Zanzibar.We may remark here that Antonio afterwards proved to be a stout, able,willing man, and a faithful servant, although a most arrant coward.From this time Harold's difficulties in regard to men vanished.  WithAntonio's able assistance nine were procured, stout, young, able-bodiedfellows they were, and all more or less naked.  Two of these werehalf-caste brothers, named respectively Jose and Oliveira; two werehalf-wild negroes of the Somali tribe named Nakoda and Conda; three werenegroes of the Makololo tribe, who had accompanied Dr Livingstone onhis journey from the far interior of Africa to the East Coast, and werenamed respectively Jumbo, Zombo, and Masiko; and finally two, namedSongolo and Mabruki, were free negroes of Quillimane.  Thus the wholeband, including Disco and the leader, formed a goodly company of twelvestout men.Of course Harold armed them all with guns and knives.  Himself and Discocarried Enfield rifles; besides which, Harold took with him a sparerifle of heavy calibre, carrying large balls, mingled with tin to hardenthem.  This latter was intended for large game.  Landing near the EastLuavo mouth of the Zambesi, our hero was fortunate enough to procure twoserviceable canoes, into which he transferred himself, his men, and hisgoods, and, bidding adieu to the Arab skipper of the dhow, commenced hisjourney into the interior of Africa.CHAPTER FIVE.IN WHICH THE TRAVELLERS ENJOY THEMSELVES EXTREMELY, AND DISCOLILLIHAMMER SEES SEVERAL ASTONISHING SIGHTS.Behold our travellers, then, fairly embarked on the waters of the greatAfrican river Zambesi, in two canoes, one of which is commanded byHarold Seadrift, the other by Disco Lillihammer.Of course these enterprising chiefs were modest enough at first to allowtwo of the Makololo men, Jumbo and Zombo, to wield the steering-oars,but after a few days' practice they became sufficiently expert, as Discosaid, to take the helm, except when strong currents rendered thenavigation difficult, or when the weather became so "piping hot" thatnone but men clad in black skins could work.We must however guard the reader here from supposing that it is alwayspiping hot in Africa.  There are occasional days when the air may bestyled lukewarm, when the sky is serene, and when all nature seemsjoyful and enjoyable,--days in which a man opens his mouth wide andswallows down the atmosphere; when he _feels_ his health and strength,and rejoices in them, and when, if he be not an infidel, he also feels asensation of gratitude to the Giver of all good.On such a day, soon after entering the East Luavo mouth of the Zambesi,the explorers, for such we may almost venture to style them, ascendedthe smooth stream close to the left bank, Harold leading, Discofollowing closely in his wake.The men rowed gently, as if they enjoyed the sweet calm of earlymorning, and were unwilling to disturb the innumerable flocks ofwild-fowl that chuckled among the reeds and sedges everywhere.  Haroldsat in the stern, leaning back, and only dipping the steering-oar lazilynow and then to keep the canoe from running on the bank, or plunginginto a forest of gigantic rushes.  Disco, having resolved to solacehimself with a whiff of his darling pipe, had resigned "the helm" toJumbo, and laid himself in a position of comfort which admitted of hisresting his head on the gunwale in such a manner that, out of thecorners of his eyes, he could gaze down into the water.The part of the river they had reached was so perfectly still that everycloud in the sky, every mangrove, root and spray, and every bendingbulrush, was perfectly reproduced in the reflected world below.Plaintive cries of wild-fowl formed appropriate melody, to whichchattering groups of monkeys and croaking bull-frogs contributed a finetenor and bass."Hallo, Disco!" exclaimed Harold in a subdued key, looking over hisshoulder."Ay, ay, sir?" sighed the seaman, without moving his position."Range up alongside; I want to speak to you.""Ay, ay, sir.--Jumbo, you black-faced villain, d'ee hear that? give wayand go 'longside."Good-humoured Jumbo _spoke_ very little English, but had come tounderstand a good deal during his travels with Dr Livingstone.  Hewrinkled his visage and showed his brilliant teeth on receiving theorder.  Muttering a word to the men, and giving a vigorous stroke, heshot up alongside of the leader's canoe."You seem comfortable," said Harold, with a laugh, as Disco's vastvisage appeared at his elbow."I is.""Isn't this jolly?" continued Harold."No, sir, 'taint.""Why, what d'you mean?""I means that jolly ain't the word, by a long way, for to express thenatur' o' my feelin's.  There ain't no word as I knows on as 'ud come upto it.  If I wor a fylosipher, now, I'd coin a word for the occasion.P'raps," continued Disco, drawing an unusually long whiff from his pipe,"p'raps, not bein' a fylosipher, I might nevertheless try to coin one.Wot's the Latin, now, for heaven?""Caelum," replied Harold."Sailum, eh?  An' wot's the 'arth?""Terra.""Terra? well now, wot rediklous names to give to 'em," said Disco,shaking his head gravely, "I can't see why the ancients couldn't ha' binsatisfied with the names that _we'd_ given 'em.  Hows'ever, that'sneither here nor there.  My notion o' the state o' things that we've gotinto here, as they now stand, is, that they are sailumterracious, whichmeans heaven-upon-earth, d'ee see?"As Disco pronounced the word with a powerful emphasis on the _u-m_ partof it the sound was rather effective, and seemed to please him."Right; you're right, or nearly so," replied Harold; "but don't youthink the word savours too much of perfection, seeing that breakfastwould add to the pleasure of the present delightful state of things, andmake them even more sailumterracious than they are?""No, sir, no; the word ain't too parfect," replied Disco, with a look ofcritical severity; "part of it is 'arth, and 'arth is imparfect, bein'susceptible of a many improvements, among which undoubtedly isbreakfast, likewise dinner an' supper, to say nothin' of lunch an' tea,which is suitable only for babbies an' wimen; so I agrees with you, sir,that the state o' things will be sailumterraciouser if we goes ashorean' has breakfast."He tapped the head of his very black little pipe on the edge of thecanoe, and heaved a sigh of contentment as he watched the ash-ball thatfloated away on the stream; then, rousing himself, he seized thesteering-oar and followed Harold into a small creek, which waspleasantly overshadowed by the rich tropical foliage of that region.While breakfast was being prepared by Antonio, whose talents as_chef-de-cuisine_ were of the highest order, Harold took his rifle andrambled into the bush in search of game--any kind of game, for at thattime he had had no experience whatever of the sport afforded by thewoods of tropical Africa, and, having gathered only a few vague ideasfrom books, he went forth with all the pleasurable excitement andexpectation that we may suppose peculiar to discoverers.Disco Lillihammer having only consumed his first pipe of tobacco, andholding it to be a duty which he owed to himself to consume two beforebreakfast, remained at the camp-fire to smoke and chaff Antonio, whosegood-nature was only equalled by his activity."Wot have 'ee got there?" inquired Disco, as Antonio poured a quantityof seed into a large pot."Dis? vy, hims be mapira," replied the interpreter, with a benignantsmile.  "Hims de cheef food ob dis konterie."It must be remarked here that Antonio's English, having been acquiredfrom all sorts of persons, in nearly every tropical part of the globe,was somewhat of a jumble, being a compound of the broken English spokenby individuals among the Germans, French, Portuguese, Arabs, andNegroes, with whom he had at various times associated, modified by hisown ignorance, and seasoned with a dash of his own inventive fancy."Is it good?" asked Disco."Goot!" exclaimed Antonio.  Being unable to find words to expresshimself, the enthusiastic cook placed his hand on the region which wasdestined ere long to become a receptacle for the mapira, and rolled hiseyes upwards in rapture.  "Hah! oo sall see behind long.""Before long, you mean," observed the seaman."Dat all same ting, s'long's you onerstand him," replied Antoniocomplacently.--"Bring vatter now, Jumbo.  Put him in careful.  Not spillon de fire--zo--goot."Jumbo filled up the kettle carefully, and a broad grin overspread hisblack visage, partly because he was easily tickled into a condition ofrisibility by the cool off-hand remarks of Disco Lillihammer, and partlybecause, having acquired his own small smattering of English from DrLivingstone, he was intelligent enough to perceive that in regard toAntonio's language there was something peculiar."Now, go fitch noder kittle--queek.""_Yis_, sar--zo--goot," replied Jumbo, mimicking the interpreter, andgoing off with a vociferous laugh at his little joke, in which he wasjoined by his sable clansmen, Masiko and Zombo."Hims got 'nuff of impoodidence," said the interpreter, as he bustledabout his avocations."He's not the only one that's got more than enough impoodidence," saidDisco, pushing a fine straw down the stem of his "cutty," to make itdraw better.  "I say, Tony," (our regardless seaman had already thusmutilated his name), "you seem to have plenty live stock in them parts.""Plenty vat?" inquired the interpreter, with a perplexed expression."Why, plenty birds and beasts,--live stock we calls it, meanin' therebylivin' creeturs."  He pointed towards an opening in the mangroves,through which were visible the neighbouring mud and sand flats, swarmingwith wild-fowl, and conspicuous among which were large flocks ofpelicans, who seemed to be gorging themselves comfortably from anapparently inexhaustible supply of fish in the pools left by thereceding tide."Ho, yis, me perceive; yis, plenty bird and beast--fishes too, andcrawbs--look dare."He pointed to a part of the sands nearest to their encampment whichappeared to be alive with some small creatures."That's coorious," said Disco, removing his pipe, and regarding thephenomenon with some interest."No, 'taint koorous, it's crawbs," replied Antonio."Crabs, is it?" said Disco, rising and sauntering down to the sands; forhe possessed an inquiring mind, with a special tendency to investigatethe habits (pranks, as he called them) of the lower animals, which, inother circumstances, might have made him a naturalist.Muttering to himself--he was fond of muttering to himself, it feltcompanionable,--"coorious, very coorious, quite 'stroanary," he creptstealthily to the edge of the mangroves, and there discovered that thesands were literally alive with myriads of minute crabs, which wereactively engaged--it was supposed by those who ought to know best--ingathering their food.  The moment the tide ebbed from any part of thesands, out came these crablets in swarms, and set to work, busy as bees,ploughing up the sand, and sifting it, apparently for food, until thewhole flat was rendered rough by their incessant labours.  Approachingcautiously, Disco observed that each crab, as he went along sidewise,gathered a round bit of moist sand at his mouth, which was quicklybrushed away by one of his claws, and replaced by another, and another,as fast as they could be brushed aside."Eatin' sand they are!" muttered Disco in surprise; but presently theimprobability of sand being very nutritious food, even for crabs, forceditself on him, and he muttered his conviction that they "was scrapin'for wittles."Having watched the crabs a considerable time, and observed that theyfrequently interrupted their labours to dart suddenly into their holesand out again--for the purpose, he conjectured, of "havin' a drop o'summat to wet their whistles,"--Disco thrust the cutty into his vestpocket, and walked a little further out on the flat in the hope ofdiscovering some new objects of interest.  Nor was he disappointed.Besides finding that the pools left by the tide swarmed with varietiesof little fish--many of them being "coorious,"--he was fortunate enoughto witness a most surprising combat.It happened thus:--Perceiving, a little to his right, some smallcreature hopping about on the sand near to a little pool, he turnedaside to observe it more closely.  On his drawing near, the creaturejumped into the pool.  Disco advanced to the edge, gazed intently intothe water, and saw nothing except his own reflected image at the bottom.Presently the creature reappeared.  It was a small fish--a familiarfish, too--which he had known in the pools of his native land by thename of blenny.  As the blenny appeared to wish to approach the edge ofthe pool, Disco retired, and, placing a hand on each knee, stooped, inorder to make himself as small as possible.  He failed, the diminutionin his height being fully counterbalanced by the latitudinal extensionof his elbows!Presently the blenny put its head out of the water, and looked about.We speak advisedly.  The blenny is altogether a singular, an exceptionalfish.  It can, and does, look sidewise, upwards and downwards, with itsprotruding eyes, as knowingly, and with as much vivacity, as if it werea human being.  This power in a fish has something of the same awesomeeffect on an observer that might possibly result were a horse to raiseits head and smile at him.Seeing that the coast was clear, for Disco stood as motionless as amangrove tree, blenny hopped upon the dry land.  The African blenny is asort of amphibious animal, living nearly as much out of the water as init.  Indeed its busiest time, we are told, [_See Dr Livingstone'sZambesi and its Tributaries_, page 843.] is at low water, when, by meansof its pectoral fins it crawls out on the sand and raises itself intosomething of a standing attitude, with its bright eyes keeping a sharplook-out for the light-coloured flies on which it feeds.For several seconds Disco gazed at the fish, and the fish gazed around,even turning its head a little, as well as its eyes, on this side and onthat.  Presently a small fly, with that giddy heedlessness whichcharacterises the race, alighted about two inches in front of blenny'snose.  Instantly the fish leaped that vast space, alighted with itsunderset mouth just over the fly, which immediately rose into it and wasentombed."Brayvo!" passed through Disco's brain, but no sound issued from hislips.Presently another of the giddy ones alighted in front of blenny about afoot distant.  This appeared to be much beyond his leaping powers, for,with a slow, stealthy motion, like a cat, he began deliberately to stalkhis victim.  The victim appeared to be blind, for it took no notice ofthe approaching monster.  Blenny displayed marvellous powers ofself-control, for he moved on steadily without accelerating his speeduntil within about two inches of his prey--then he leapt as before, andanother fly was entombed."Well done!" exclaimed Disco, mentally, but still his lips and body weremotionless as before.At this point an enemy, in the shape of another blenny, appeared on thescene.  It came up out of a small pool close at hand, and seemed tocovet the first blenny's pool, and to set about taking possession of itas naturally as if it had been a human being; for, observing, no doubt,that its neighbour was busily engaged, it moved quietly in the directionof the coveted pool.  Being a very little fish, it was not observed byDisco, but it was instantly noticed by the first blenny, which, beingrather the smaller of the two, we shall style the Little one.Suddenly Big Blenny threw off all disguise, bounded towards the pool,which was about a foot square, and plunged in.  No mortal blenny couldwitness this unwarrantable invasion of its hearth and home without beingstirred to indignant wrath.  With eyes that seemed to flash fire, anddorsal fin bristling up with rage, Little Blenny made five tremendousleaps of full three inches each, and disappeared.  Another moment and aminiature storm ruffled the pool: for a few seconds the heavings of thedeep were awful; then, out jumped Big Blenny and tried to flee, but outjumped Little Blenny and caught him by the tail; round turned the bigone and caught the other by the jaw."Hallo, Disco! breakfast's ready--where are you?" shouted Harold fromthe woods.Disco replied not.  It is a question whether he heard the hail at all,so engrossed was he in this remarkable fight."Brayvo!" he exclaimed aloud, when Little Blenny shook his big enemy offand rolled over him."Cleverly done!" he shouted, when Big Blenny with a dart took refuge inthe pool."I knowed it," he cried approvingly, when Little Blenny forced him asecond time to evacuate the premises, "Go in an' win, little 'un,"thought Disco.Thus the battle raged furiously, now in the water, now on the sand,while the excited seaman danced round the combatants--both of whomappeared to have become deaf and blind with rage--and gave them strongencouragement, mingled with appropriate advice and applause.  In factDisco's delight would have been perfect, had the size of thebelligerents admitted of his patting the little blenny on the back; butthis of course was out of the question!At last having struck, worried, bitten, and chased each other by landand sea for several minutes, these pugnacious creatures seized eachother by their respective throats, like two bull-dogs, and fellexhausted on the sand."It's a draw!" exclaimed Disco, rather disappointed."No, 'tain't," he said, as Little Blenny, reviving, rose up and renewedthe combat more furiously than ever; but it was soon ended, for BigBlenny suddenly turned and fled to his own pool.  Little Blenny did notcrow; he did not even appear to be elated.  He evidently felt that hehad been called on to perform a disagreeable but unavoidable duty, anddeemed it quite unnecessary to wave banners, fire guns, or ring bells incelebration of his victory, as he dived back into his pool amid theringing cheers of Disco Lillihammer."Upon my word, if you have not gone stark mad, you must have had asunstroke," said Harold, coming forward, "what's the matter?""Too late! too late!" cried Disco, in a mingled tone of amusement andregret."D'ye think it is?  Are you incurable already?" asked his friend."Too late to see the most a-stonishin' scrimmage I ever did behold in_my_ life," said Disco.The description of this scrimmage gave the worthy seaman a subject forconversation and food for meditation during the greater part of the timespent over the morning meal, and there is no saying how long he wouldhave kept referring to and chuckling over it--to the great admirationand sympathy of the black fellows, who are, as a race, excessively fondof jocularity and fun--had not another of the denizens of the mangrovejungle diverted his attention and thoughts rather suddenly.This was a small monkey, which, seated on a branch overhead, peered atthe breakfast-party from among the leaves, with an expression of inquiryand of boundless astonishment that it is quite impossible to describe.Surprise of the most sprightly nature, if we may say so, sat enthronedon that small monkey's countenance, an expression which was enhanced bythe creature's motions, for, not satisfied with taking a steady look atthe intruders from the right side of a leaf, it thrust forward itslittle black head on the left side of it, and then under it, by way ofvariety; but no additional light seemed to result from these changes inthe point of observation, for the surprise did not diminish.In one of its intent stares it caught the eye of Disco.  The seaman'sjaws stopped, as if suddenly locked, and his eyes opened to theirwidest.The monkey seemed to feel uneasily that it had attracted attention, forit showed the smallest possible glimpse of its teeth.  The action,coupled with the leafy shadows which fell on its countenance, had theeffect of a smile, which caused Disco to burst into a loud laugh andpoint upwards.  To bound from its position to a safer retreat, andthence stare at Disco with deep indignation, and a threatening displayof all its teeth and gums, in addition to its looks of surprise, was thework of a moment on the part of the small monkey, whereat Disco burstinto a renewed roar of laughter, in which he was joined by the wholeparty."Are there many o' them fellows hereabouts?" inquired the seaman ofAntonio."Ho, yis, lots ob 'em.  T'ousands ebery whars; see, dare am morer."He pointed to another part of the umbrageous canopy overhead, where theface of a still smaller monkey was visible, engaged, like the previousone, in an earnest scrutiny of the party, but with a melancholy, ratherthan a surprised, expression of visage."Wot a miserable, broken-hearted thing!" said Disco, grinning, in whichact he was immediately copied by the melancholy monkey, though fromdifferent motives.Disco was very fond of monkeys.  All his life he had felt a desire topat and fondle those shivering creatures which he had been accustomed tosee on barrel-organs in his native land, and the same strong impulsecame over him now."Wot a pity the creeturs smell so bad, and ain't cleanly," he remarked,gazing affectionately up among the leaves, "they'd make such capitalpets; why, there's another."This remark had reference to a third monkey, of large dimensions andfierce countenance, which at that moment rudely thrust the melancholymonkey aside, and took its place.  The latter, with a humble air andaction, took up a new position, somewhat nearer to the fire, where itssad countenance was more distinctly seen."Well, it does seem a particularly sorrowful monkey, that," said Harold,laughing, as he helped himself to another canful of tea."The most miserable objic' I ever did see," observed Disco.The negroes looked at each other and laughed.  They were accustomed tomonkeys, and took little notice of them, but they were mightily tickledby Disco's amusement, for he had laid down his knife and fork, and shooka good deal with internal chuckling, as he gazed upwards."One would suppose, now," he said softly, "that it had recently seen itsfather and mother, and all its brothers and sisters, removed by aviolent death, or sold into slavery.""Ha! they never see that," said Harold; "the brutes may fight and kill,but they never _enslave_ each other.  It is the proud prerogative of manto do that.""That's true, sir, worse luck, as Paddy says," rejoined Disco.  "Butlook there: wot's them coorious things round the creetur's waist--a pairo' the werry smallest hands--and, hallo! a face no bigger than a button!I do believe that it's--"Disco did not finish the sentence, but he was right.  The smallmelancholy monkey was a mother!Probably that was the cause of its sorrow.  It is a touching thoughtthat anxiety for its tiny offspring perhaps had furrowed that monkey'svisage with the wrinkles of premature old age.  That danger threatenedit on every side was obvious, for no sooner had it taken up its newposition, after its unceremonious ejection by the fierce monkey, thanthe sprightly monkey, before referred to, conceived a plot which itimmediately proceeded to carry into execution.  Observing that the tailof the sad one hung down in a clear space below the branch on which itsat, the sprightly fellow quickly, but with intense caution and silence,crept towards it, and when within a yard or so sprang into the air andcaught the tail!A wild shriek, and what Disco styled a "scrimmage," ensued, during whichthe mother monkey gave chase to him of the lively visage, using herarms, legs, and tail promiscuously to grasp and hold on to branches, andleaving her extremely little one to look out for itself.  This it seemedquite capable of doing, for no limpet ever stuck to a solid rock withgreater tenacity than did that infant to the maternal waist throughoutthe chase.  The hubbub appeared to startle the whole monkey race,revealing the fact that troops of other monkeys had, unobserved, beengazing at the strangers in silent wonder, since the time of theirlanding.Pleasant however, though this state of things undeniably was, it couldnot be expected to last.  Breakfast being concluded, it became necessarythat Disco should tear himself from the spot which, having first solacedhimself with a pipe, he did with a good grace, remarking, as here-embarked and "took the helm" of his canoe, that he had got morepowerful surprises that morning than he had ever before experienced inany previous twelvemonth of his life.Before long he received many more surprises, especially one of a verydifferent and much less pleasant nature, an account of which will befound in the next chapter.CHAPTER SIX.DESCRIBES SEVERAL NEW AND SURPRISING INCIDENTS, WHICH MUST BE READ TO BEFULLY APPRECIATED.To travel with one's mouth and eyes opened to nearly their utmost widthin a state of surprised stupefaction, may be unavoidable, but it cannotbe said to be either becoming or convenient.  Attention in such a caseis apt to be diverted from the business in hand, and flies have atendency to immolate themselves in the throat.Nevertheless, inconvenient though the condition was, our friend DiscoLillihammer was so afflicted with astonishment at what he heard and sawin this new land, that he was constantly engaged in swallowing flies andrunning his canoe among shallows and rushes, insomuch that he at lastresigned the steering-oar until familiarity with present circumstancesshould tone him down to a safe condition of equanimity.And no wonder that Disco was surprised; no wonder that his friend HaroldSeadrift shared in his astonishment and delight, for they were at once,and for the first time in their lives, plunged into the very heart ofjungle life in equatorial Africa!  Those who have never wandered farfrom the comparatively tame regions of our temperate zone, can form buta faint conception of what it is to ramble in the tropics, and thereforecan scarcely be expected to sympathise fully with the mental conditionof our heroes as they ascended the Zambesi.  Everything was sothoroughly strange; sights and sounds so vastly different from what theyhad been accustomed to see and hear, that it seemed as though they hadlanded on another planet.  Trees, shrubs, flowers, birds, beasts,insects, and reptiles, all were unfamiliar, except indeed, one or two ofthe more conspicuous trees and animals, which had been so imprinted ontheir minds by means of nursery picture-books that, on first beholdingthem, Disco unconsciously paid these books the compliment of saying thatthe animals "wos uncommon like the picturs."Disco's mental condition may be said, for the first two or three days,to have been one of gentle ever-flowing surprise, studded thickly withlittle bursts of keen astonishment.The first part of the river ran between mangrove jungle, in regard towhich he remarked that "them there trees had legs like crabs," in whichobservation he was not far wrong, for, when the tide was out, the rootsof the mangroves rose high out of the mud, forming supports, as it were,for the trees to stand on.But it was the luxuriance of the vegetation that made the most powerfulimpression on the travellers.  It seemed as if the various groups andfamilies of the vegetable kingdom had been warmed by the sun into astate of unwonted affection, for everything appeared to entertain thedesire to twine round and embrace everything else.  One magnificentscrew-palm in particular was so overwhelmed by affectionate parasitesthat his natural shape was almost entirely concealed.  Others of thetrees were decked with orchilla weed.  There were ferns so gigantic asto be almost worthy of being styled trees, and palm-bushes so sprawlingas to suggest the idea of huge vegetable spiders.  Bright yellow fruitgleamed among the graceful green leaves of the mangroves; wilddate-palms gave variety to the scene, if that had been needed, which itwas not, and masses of umbrageous plants with large yellow flowers grewalong the banks, while, down among the underwood, giant roots rose infantastic convolutions above ground, as if the earth were already toofull, and there wasn't room for the whole of them.  There was anantediluvian magnificence, a prehistoric snakiness, a sort of primevalrunning-to-seedness, which filled Harold and Disco with feelings of awe,and induced a strange, almost unnatural tendency to regard Adam and Eveas their contemporaries.Animal life was not wanting in this paradise.  Frequently did our seamangive vent to "Hallo!"  "There they go!"  "Look out for the little 'unwi' the long tail!" and similar expressions, referring of course to hisfavourite monkeys, which ever and anon peered out upon the strangerswith looks of intensity, for whatever their expression might be--sadness, grief, interrogation, wrath, surprise--it was always in thesuperlative degree.  There were birds also, innumerable.  One, styledthe "king-hunter," sang wild exultant airs, as if it found king-huntingto be an extremely exhilarating occupation, though what sort of kings ithunted we cannot tell.  Perhaps it was the king of beasts, perhaps thekingfisher, a bright specimen of which was frequently seen to dart outfrom the banks, but we profess ignorance on this point.  There werefish-hawks also, magnificent fellows, which sat in regal dignity on thetops of the mangrove trees, and the glossy ibis, with others of thefeathered tribe too numerous to mention.Large animals also were there in abundance, though not so frequentlyseen as those which have been already mentioned.  Disco occasionallymade known the fact that such, or something unusual, had transpired, bythe sudden and violent exclamation of "What's that?" in a voice so loudthat "that," whatever it might be, sometimes bolted or took to flightbefore any one else caught sight of it."Hallo!" he exclaimed, on one such occasion, as the canoes turned a bendof the river."What now?" demanded Harold, looking at his companion to observe thedirection of his eyes."I'm a Dutchman," exclaimed Disco in a hoarse whisper that might havebeen heard half a mile off, "if it's not a zebra!""So it is; my rifle--look sharp!" said Harold eagerly.The weapon was handed to him, but before it could be brought to bear,the beautiful striped creature had tossed its head, snorted, whisked itstail, kicked up its heels, and dashed into the jungle."Give way, lads; let's after him," shouted Disco, turning the canoe'sbow to shore."Hold on," cried Harold; "you might as well go after a needle in ahaystack, or a locomotive.""So I might," admitted Disco, with a mortified air, resuming his course;"but it ain't in reason to expect a feller to keep quiet w'en he seesone o' the very picturs of his child'ood, so to speak, come alive an'kick up its heels like that."Buffaloes were also seen in the grassy glades, but it proved difficultto come within range of them; also wart-hogs, and three different kindsof antelope.Of these last Harold shot several, and they were found to be excellentfood.Human beings were also observed, but those first encountered fled at thesight of the white men, as if they had met with their worst foes; andsuch was in very truth the case,--if we may regard the Portuguesehalf-castes of that coast as white men,--for these negroes were runawayslaves, who stood the chance of being shot, or drowned, or whipped todeath, if recaptured.Other animals they saw--some queer, some terrible, nearly all strange--and last, though not least, the hippopotamus.When Disco first saw this ungainly monster he was bereft of speech forsome minutes.  The usual "Hallo!" stuck in his throat and well-nighchoked him.  He could only gasp, and point."Ay, there goes a hippopotamus," said Harold, with the easy nonchalanceof a man who had been to the Zoological Gardens, and knew all about it.Nevertheless it was quite plain that Harold was much excited, for healmost dropped his oar overboard in making a hasty grasp at his rifle.Before he could fire, the creature gaped wide, as if in laughter, anddived."Unfortunate!" said Harold, in a philosophically careless tone; "nevermind, we shall see lots more of them.""Ugliness embodied!" said Disco, heaving a deep sigh."But him's goot for eat," said Antonio, smacking his lips."Is he?" demanded Disco of Jumbo, whose enjoyment of the sailor'sexpressive looks was so great, that, whenever the latter opened hislips, the former looked back over his shoulder with a broad grin ofexpectation."Ho yis; de hiputmus am fust-rate grub for dis yer boy," replied thenegro, rolling his red tongue inside his mouth suggestively."He never eats man, does he?" inquired Disco."Nevair," replied Antonio."He looks as if he might," returned the seaman; "anyhow, he's got amouth big enough to do it.  You're quite sure he don't, I 'spose?""Kite sure an' sartin; but me hab seen him tak mans," said Antonio."Tak mans, wot d'ee mean by that?""Tak him," repeated Antonio.  "Go at him's canoe or boat--bump withhim's head--dash in de timbers--capsize, so's man hab to swim shore--allas got clear ob de crokidils."While Disco was meditating on this unpleasant trait of character in thehippopotamus, the specimen which they had just seen, or some othermember of his family, having compassion, no doubt, on the seaman'signorance, proceeded to illustrate its method of attack then and thereby rising suddenly under the canoe with such force, that its head andshoulders shot high out of the water, into which it fell with a heavysplash.  Harold's rifle being ready, he fired just as it wasdisappearing.Whether he hit or not is uncertain, but next moment the enraged animalrose again under Disco's canoe, which it nearly lifted out of the waterin its efforts to seize it in its mouth.  Fortunately the canoe was tooflat for its jaws to grip; the monster's blunt teeth were felt, as wellas heard, to grind across the planks; and Disco being in the stern,which was raised highest, was almost thrown overboard by the jerk.Rising about two yards off, the hippopotamus looked savagely at thecanoe, and was about to dive again when Harold gave it a second shot.The large gun being fortunately ready, had been handed to him by one ofthe Makololo men.  The heavy ball took effect behind the eye, and killedthe animal almost instantaneously.  The hippopotamus usually sinks whenshot dead, but in this case they were so near that, before it had timeto sink, Zombo, assisted by his friend Jumbo, made a line fast to it,and it was finally dragged to the shore.  The landing, however, was muchretarded by the crocodiles, which now showed themselves for the firsttime, and kept tugging and worrying the carcase much as a puppy tugs andworries a ladies' muff; affording Disco and his friend strong reason tocongratulate themselves that the canoe had not been overturned.The afternoon was pretty well advanced when the landing was accomplishedon a small sandy island, and as the spot was suitable for encamping,they determined to remain there for the night, and feast.There are many points of resemblance between savage and civilisedfestivities.  Whether the performers be the black sons of Africa, or thewhite fathers of Europe, there is the same powerful tendency to eat toomuch, and the same display of good-fellowship; for it is an indisputablefact that feeding man is amiable, unless, indeed, he be dyspeptic.There are also, however, various points of difference.  The savage,owing to the amount of fresh air and exercise which he is compelled totake, usually eats with greater appetite, and knows nothing of equinedreams or sleepless nights.  On the whole, we incline to the beliefthat, despite his lack of refinement and ceremony, the savage has thebest of it in this matter.Disco Lillihammer's visage, during the progress of that feast, formed astudy worthy of a physiognomist.  Every new achievement, whethertrifling or important, performed by the Makololo triad, Jumbo, Zombo,and Masiko--every fresh hippopotamus steak skewered and set up to roastby the half-caste brothers Jose and Oliveira--every lick bestowed ontheir greasy fingers by the Somali negroes Nakoda and Conda, and everysigh of intense satisfaction heaved by the so-called "freemen" ofQuillimane, Songolo and Mabruki, was watched, commented on, and, if wemay say so, reflected in the animated countenance of the stout seaman,with such variety of expression, and such an interesting compound ofgrin and wrinkle, that poor Jumbo, who gazed at him over hippopotamusribs and steaks, and tried hard not to laugh, was at last compelled toturn away his eyes, in order that his mouth might have fair-play.But wonderful, sumptuous, and every way satisfactory though that feastwas, it bore no comparison whatever to another feast carried on at thesame time by another party, about fifty yards off, where the carcase ofthe hippopotamus had been left half in and half out of the water--for,of course, being fully more than a ton in weight, only a small portionof the creature was appropriated by the canoe-men.  The negroes paid noattention whatever to this other festive party; but in a short timeDisco turned his head to one side, and said--"Wy, wot's that splashin' Ihears goin' on over there?""I suspect it must be some beast or other that has got hold of thecarcase," replied Harold, who was himself busy with a portion of thesame."Yis, dat am krokidils got 'im," said Antonio, with his mouth full--veryfull."You don't say so?" said Disco, washing down the steak with a brimmingcup of tea.No one appeared to think it worth while to asseverate the fact, for itwas self-evident.  Several crocodiles were supping, and in doing so theytore away at the carcase with such violence, and lashed the water sofrequently with their powerful tails, as to render it clear that theirfeast necessitated laborious effort, and seemed less a recreation than aduty.  Moreover, they sat at their meat like insatiable gourmands, solong into the night that supper became transmuted into breakfast, andHarold's rest was greatly disturbed thereby.  He was too sleepy andlazy, however, to rise and drive them away.Next morning the travellers started early, being anxious to pass, asquietly as possible, a small Portuguese town, near to which it was saida party of runaway slaves and rebels against the Government were engagedin making depredations.When grey dawn was beginning to rise above the tree-tops, they lefttheir encampment in profound silence, and rowed up stream as swiftly aspossible.  They had not advanced far, when, on turning a point coveredwith tall reeds, Zombo, who was bowman in the leading canoe, suddenlymade a sign to the men to cease rowing."What's the matter?" whispered Harold.The negro pointed through the reeds, and whispered the single word"Canoe."By this time the other canoe had ranged up alongside, and after a briefconsultation between Harold and Disco, it was decided that they shouldpush gently into the reeds, and wait till the strange canoe should pass;but a few seconds sufficed to show that the two men who paddled it didnot intend to pass down the river, for they pushed straight out towardsthe deepest part of the stream.  They were, however, carried down soswiftly by the current that they were brought quite near to the point ofrushes where our travellers lay concealed--so near that their voicescould be distinctly heard.  They talked in Portuguese.Antonio muttered a few words, and Harold observed that there was a gooddeal of excitement in the looks of his men."What's the matter?" he asked anxiously.Antonio shook his head.  "Dat nigger goin' to be drownded," he said;"bad nigger--obstropolous nigger, suppose.""Wot!" exclaimed Disco in a whisper, "goin' to be drownded! wot d'eemean?"Antonio proceeded to explain that it was a custom amongst the Portugueseslave-owners there, when they found any of their slaves intractable orrefractory, to hire some individuals who, for a small sum, would bindand carry off the incorrigible for the purpose of making away with him.One method of effecting this was to tie him in a sack and throw him intothe river, the crocodiles making quite sure that the unfortunate beingshould never again be seen, either alive or dead.  But before Antoniohad finished his brief explanation he was interrupted by an exclamationfrom the horrified Englishmen, as they beheld the two men in the canoeraise something between them which for a moment appeared to struggleviolently."Shove off! give way!" shouted Harold and Disco in the same breath, eachthrusting with his paddle so vigorously that the two canoes shot outlike arrows into the stream.At the same instant there was a heavy plunge in the water beside thestrange canoe, and the victim sank.  Next moment one end of the sackrose to the surface.  Both Harold and Disco made straight towards it,but it sank again, and the two murderers paddled to the shore, on whichthey drew up their canoe, intending to take to the bush, if necessary,for safety.Once again the sack rose not more than three yards from Disco's canoe.The bold seaman knew that if it disappeared a third time there would belittle chance of its rising again.  He was prompt in action, and daringto recklessness.  In one moment he had leaped overboard, dived, caughtthe sack in his powerful grasp, and bore it to the surface.  The canoehad been steered for him.  The instant he appeared, strong and readyhands laid hold of him and his burden, and dragged them both inboard."Cut the lashin's and give him air," cried Disco, endeavouring to findhis clasp-knife; but one of the men quickly obeyed the order, and openedthe sack.A groan of horror and pity burst from the seaman when he beheld thealmost insensible form of a powerful negro, whose back was laceratedwith innumerable ragged cuts, and covered with clotted blood."Where are the--"He stopped short on looking round, and, observing that the two men werestanding on the shore, seized a double-barrelled gun.  The stream hadcarried the canoe a considerable distance below the spot where themurder had been attempted, but they were still within range.  Without amoment's hesitation Disco took deliberate aim at them and fired.Fortunately for him and his party Disco was a bad shot--nevertheless thebullet struck so close to the feet of the two men that it drove the sandand pebbles into their faces.  They turned at once and fled, but beforethey reached the cover of the bushes the second barrel was fired, andthe bullet whistled close enough over their heads greatly to acceleratetheir flight.The negroes opened their great round eyes, and appeared awe-struck atthis prompt display of a thirst for vengeance on the part of one who hadhitherto shown no other disposition than hilarity, fun, and good-humour.Harold was greatly relieved to observe Disco's failure, for, if he hadhit either of the fugitives, the consequences might have been verydisastrous to their expedition.On being partially revived and questioned, it turned out that the poorfellow had been whipped almost to death for refusing to be theexecutioner in whipping his own mother.  This was a refinement incruelty on the part of these professedly Christian Portuguese, which ourtravellers afterwards learned was by no means uncommon.We are told by those who know that region well, and whose veracity isunquestionable, that the Portuguese on the east coast of Africa live inconstant dread of their slaves rising against them.  No wonder,considering the fiendish cruelties to which they subject them!  In orderto keep them in subjection they underfeed them, and if any of themventure to steal cocoa-nuts from the trees the owners thereof are atliberty to shoot them and throw them into the sea.  Slaves being cheapthere, and plentiful, are easily replaced, hence a cruel owner neverhesitates.  If a slave is refractory, and flogging only makes him worse,his master bids the overseer flog him until "he will require no more."Still further to keep them in subjection, the Portuguese then endeavourto eradicate from them all sympathy with each other, and all naturalaffection, by the following means.  If a woman requires to be flogged,her brother or son is selected to do it.  Fathers are made to flog theirdaughters, husbands their wives, and, if two young negroes of differentsexes are observed to show any symptoms of growing attachment for eachother, these two are chosen for each other's executioners.  [See_Travels in Eastern Africa_, by Lyons McLeod, Esquire, FRGS, and lateHer Britannic Majesty's Consul at Mozambique, volume one pages 274 to277, and volume two page 27.]The poor wretch whom we have just described as having been saved fromdeath, to which he had been doomed for refusing to become theexecutioner of his own mother, was placed as tenderly and comfortably ascircumstances would admit of in the bottom of the canoe, and then ourtravellers pushed on with all haste--anxious to pass the town before thetwo fugitives could give the alarm.They were successful in this, probably because the two men may have hidthemselves for some time in the jungle, under the impression that theexasperated Englishmen might be searching for them on shore.Giving themselves time only to take a hurried meal in the middle of theday, our travellers rowed continuously till sunset when, deeming itprobable that pursuit, if undertaken at all, must have been abandoned,they put ashore on the right bank of the river and encamped.When the sufferer had been made as comfortable as circumstances wouldallow--for he was much weakened by loss of blood as well as agonisedwith pain--and after he had been refreshed with food and some warm tea,Harold questioned him, through the interpreter, as to his previoushistory.At first the man was brusque in his manner, and inclined to be sulky,for a long course of cruelty had filled him with an intense hatred ofwhite men.  Indeed, an embittered and desperate spirit had begun toinduce callous indifference to all men, whether white or black.  Butkind treatment, to which he was evidently unaccustomed, and generousdiet, which was obviously new to him, had a softening influence, andwhen Harold poured a small glass of rum into his tea, and Antonio addeda lump of sugar, and Disco pressed him tenderly to drink it off--whichhe did--the effect was very decided; the settled scowl on his facebecame unsettled, and gradually melting away, was replaced by a milderand more manly look.  By degrees he became communicative, and, bit bybit, his story was drawn from him.  It was brief, but very sorrowful.His name, he said, was Chimbolo.  He belonged to a tribe which lived farinland, beyond the Manganja country, which latter was a country ofhills.  He was not a Manganja man, but he had married a Manganja woman.One night he, with his wife and mother, was paying a visit to thevillage of his wife's relations, when a band of slave-hunters suddenlyattacked the village.  They were armed with guns, and at once began tomurder the old people and capture the young.  Resistance was useless.His relatives were armed only with bows and spears.  Being taken bysurprise, they all fled in terror, but were pursued and few escaped.His wife, he said--and a scowl of terrible ferocity crossed Chimbolo'sface as he said it--was about to become a mother at the time.  He seizedher in his arms on the first alarm, and fled with her into the bush,where he concealed her, and then hurried back to aid his relations, butmet them--old and young, strong and feeble--flying for their lives.  Itwas not possible to rally them; he therefore joined in the flight.While running, a bullet grazed his head and stunned him.  Presently herecovered and rose, but in a few minutes was overtaken and captured.  Aslave-stick was put on his neck, and, along with a number of Manganjamen, women, and children, he was driven down to the coast, and sold,with a number of other men and women, among whom was his own mother, toa Portuguese merchant on the coast, near the East Luavo mouth of theZambesi.  There he was found to be of a rebellious spirit, and at laston positively refusing to lash his mother, his master ordered him to bewhipped to death, but, changing his mind before the order had been quitecarried out he ordered him to be bound hand and foot and taken away in asack.  As to his wife, he had never heard of her since that night whichwas about two years past.  He knew that she had not been found, becausehe had not seen her amongst the other captives.  If they had found herthey would have been sure to carry her off, because--here Chimbolo'svisage again grew diabolical--she was young, he said, and beautiful.When all this had been translated into bad English by Antonio, Haroldasked if Chimbolo thought it probable that his wife was still alive inthe Manganja highlands.  To this the former said that he thought itlikely."W'y, then," said Disco, giving his right thigh a powerful slap, whichwas his favourite method of emphasising a remark, "wot d'ye say, sir, tolay our course for these same highlands, and try for to find out thispoor critter?""Just what was running in my own mind, Disco," said Harold, musing overhis supper.  "It does not make much difference what part of this countrywe go to, being all new to us; and as Antonio tells me the Manganjahighlands are up the Shire river, which was explored by Dr Livingstonenot long ago, and is not distant many days' journey from this, I thinkwe can't do better than go there.  We shall have a good as well as adefinite object in view.""Wery good, sir; I'm agreeable," returned Disco, reaching forth hispewter plate; "another hunk o' that pottimus, Jumbo; it's better thansalt-junk any day; and I say, Jumbo, don't grin so much, else ye'llenlarge yer pretty little mouth, which 'ud be a pity.""Yis, saar," replied Jumbo, becoming very grave all of a sudden, but onreceiving a nod and an expressive wink from the seaman, he explodedagain, and rolled backward on the grass, in the performance of which acthe capsized Zombo's can of tea, whereupon Zombo leaped upon him inwrath, and Masiko, as in duty bound, came to the rescue."Clap a stopper on yer noise, will 'ee?" cried Disco sternly, "elseyou'll be bringin' all the wild beasts in these parts down on us to seewot it's all about.""That reminds me," said Harold, when quiet was restored, "that we mustnow organise ourselves into something of a fighting band--a company, asit were, of soldiers,--and take our regular spell of watching by night,for, from all that I hear of the disturbed state of the country justnow, with these runaway slaves and rebels, it will be necessary to be onour guard.  Of course," he added, smiling, "I suppose I must be captainof the company, and you, Disco, shall be lieutenant.""Not at all," replied the seaman, shaking his head, and frowning atJumbo, whose brilliant teeth at once responded to the glance, "not atall, none of your sodgerin' for me.  I never could abide the lobsters.Fust-mate, sir, that's wot _I_ am, if I'm to be expected to do mydooty.""Well then, first-mate be it," rejoined Harold, "and Antonio shall beserjeant-major--""Bo's'n--bo's'n," suggested Disco; "keep up appearances wotiver ye do,an' don't let the memory of salt water go down.""Very good," said Harold, laughing; "then you shall be boatswain,Antonio, as well as cook, and I will instruct you in the first part ofyour duty, which will be to keep watch for an hour while the rest of ussleep.  My first-mate will teach you the whistling part of a boatswain'sduty, if that should be required--""Ah, and the roar," interrupted Disco, "a bo's'n would be nothin'without his roar--"At that moment the woods around them were filled with a tremendous andvery unexpected roar, which caused the whole party to spring up, andinduced the new bo's'n to utter a yell of terror that would have donecredit to the whistle of the most violent bo's'n on the sea.  Nextmoment the travellers were surrounded by a large and excited band ofarmed negroes.CHAPTER SEVEN.ENEMIES ARE CHANGED INTO FRIENDS--OUR TRAVELLERS PENETRATE INTO THEINTERIOR OF THE LAND.To possess the power of looking perfectly calm and unconcerned when youare in reality considerably agitated and rather anxious, is extremelyuseful in any circumstances, but especially so when one happens to be inthe midst of grinning, gesticulating, naked savages.Our hero, Harold Seadrift possessed that power in an eminent degree, andhis first-mate, Disco Lillihammer, was not a whit behind him.  Althoughboth had started abruptly to their legs at the first alarm, and drawntheir respective revolvers, they no sooner found themselves surroundedby overwhelming numbers than they lowered their weapons, and, turningback to back, faced the intruders with calm countenances."Sit down, men, every one of you except Antonio," said Harold, in aquiet, but clear and decided voice.His men, who, having left their guns in the canoe, were utterlyhelpless, quietly obeyed."Who are you, and what do you want?" demanded Antonio, by Harold'sorder.To this a tall negro, who was obviously the leader of the band, repliedin the native tongue,--"It matters little who we are; you are in ourpower.""Not quite," said Harold, slightly moving his revolver.  "Tell him thathe _may_ overcome us, but before he does so my friend and I carry thelives of twelve of his men in our pistols."The negro chief, who quite understood the powers of a revolver,replied--"Tell your master, that before he could fire two shots, he andhis friend would have each twelve bullets in his body.  But I have nottime to palaver here.  Who are you, and where are you going?""We are Englishmen, travelling to see the country," replied Harold.The chief looked doubtfully at him, and seemed to waver, then suddenlymaking up his mind, he frowned and said sternly--"No; that is a lie.You are Portuguese scoundrels.  You shall all die.  You have robbed usof our liberty, our wives, our children, our homes; you have chained,and tortured, and flogged us!"--he gnashed his teeth at this point, andhis followers grew excited.  "Now we have got free, and you are caught.We will let you know what it is to be slaves."As the negro chief stirred up his wrath by thus recounting his wrongs,and advanced a step, Harold begged Disco, in a low, urgent voice, not toraise his pistol.  Then looking the savage full in the face, withoutshowing a trace of anxiety, he said--"You are wrong.  We are indeedEnglishmen, and you know that the English detest slavery, and would, ifthey could, put a stop to it altogether.""Yes, I know that," said the chief.  "We have seen one Englishman here,and he has made us to know that not all men with white faces aredevils--like the Portuguese and Arabs.  But how am I to know you areEnglish?"Again the chief wavered a little, as if half-inclined to believeHarold's statement."Here is proof for you," said Harold, pointing to Chimbolo, who, beingscarcely able to move, had remained all this time beside the fireleaning on his elbow and listening intently to the conversation.  "See,"he continued, "that is a slave.  Look at him."As he said this, Harold stepped quickly forward and removed the blanket,with which he had covered his lacerated back after dressing it.A howl of execration burst from the band of negroes, who pointed theirspears and guns at the travellers' breasts, and would have made a speedyend of the whole party if Antonio had not exclaimed "Speak, Chimbolo,speak!"The slave looked up with animation, and told the rebels how hisPortuguese owner had ordered him to be flogged to death, but changed hismind and doomed him to be drowned,--how that in the nick of time, thesewhite men had rescued him, and had afterwards treated him with thegreatest kindness.Chimbolo did not say much, but what he did say was uttered with emphasisand feeling.  This was enough.  Those who would have been enemies weresuddenly converted into warm friends, and the desperadoes, who wouldhave torn their former masters, or any of their race, limb from limb, ifthey could have got hold of them, left our adventurers undisturbed intheir bivouac, after wishing them a prosperous journey.It was nevertheless deemed advisable to keep watch during the night.This was done faithfully and conscientiously as far as it went.  Haroldtook the first hour by way of example.  He sat over the fire,alternately gazing into its embers while he meditated of home, and roundupon the dark forest while he thought of Africa.  True to time, hecalled Disco, who, equally true to his sense of duty, turned out at oncewith a deep "Ay, ay, sir."  The self-styled first-mate placed his backagainst a tree, and, endeavouring to believe it to be a capstan, orbinnacle, or any other object appertaining to the sea, stared at theghostly stems of the forest-trees until they began to dance hornpipesfor his special gratification, or glowered at the shadows until theybecame instinct with life, and all but induced him to rouse the camptwenty times in the course of his hour's vigil.  True to time also, likehis predecessor, Disco roused Antonio and immediately turned in.The vivacious _chef de cuisine_ started up at once, took up his positionat the foot of the tree which Disco had just left, leaned his backagainst it, and straightway went to sleep, in which condition heremained till morning, leaving the camp in unprotected felicity andblissful ignorance.Fortunately for all parties, Disco awoke in time to catch him napping,and resolved to punish him.  He crept stealthily round to the back ofthe tree against which the faithless man leaned, and reached gentlyround until his mouth was close to Antonio's cheek, then, collecting allthe air that his vast lungs were capable of containing, he poured intoAntonio's ear a cumulative roar that threw the camp and the denizens ofthe wilderness far and near into confusion, and almost drove the wholemarrow in Antonio's body out at his heels.  The stricken man sprang upas if earth had shot him forth, uttered a yell of terror such as seldomgreets the ear, and rushed blindly forward.  Repeating the roar, Discoplunged after him.  Antonio tumbled over the fire, recovered himself,dashed on, and would certainly have plunged into the river, if not intothe jaws of a crocodile, had not Jumbo caught him in his arms, in themidst of a chorus of laughter from the other men."How dare 'ee go to sleep on dooty?" demanded Disco, seizing the culpritby the collar, "eh! we might have bin all murdered by rebels or eaten bylions, or had our eyes picked out by gorillas, for all that _you_ wouldhave done to prevent it--eh?" giving him a shake."Oh, pardon, forgif.  Nevair doot more again," exclaimed the breathlessand trembling Antonio."You'd _better_ not!" said Disco, giving him another shake and releasinghim.Having done so, he turned on his heel and bestowed a quiet look, inpassing, on Jumbo, which of course threw that unfortunate man intoconvulsions.After this little incident a hasty breakfast was taken, the canoes werelaunched, and the voyage was continued.It is not necessary to trace the course of our explorers day by day asthey ascended the Zambesi, or to recount all the adventures ormisadventures that befell them on their journey into the interior.  Itis sufficient for the continuity of our tale to say that many days afterleaving the coast they turned into the Shire river, which flows into theZambesi about 150 miles from the coast.There are many fountain-heads of slavery in Africa.  The region of theinterior, which gives birth to the head-waters of the Shire river, isone of the chief of these.  Here lies the great lake Nyassa, which wasdiscovered and partly explored by Dr Livingstone, and hence flows aperennial stream of traffic to Kilwa, on the coast--which traffic, atthe present time, consists almost exclusively of the two kinds of ivory,white and black, the former (elephants' tusks) being carried by thelatter (slaves), by which means the slave-trade is rendered moreprofitable.Towards this populous and fertile region, then, our adventurers directedtheir course, when they turned out of the great river Zambesi and beganto ascend the Shire.And here, at the very outset of this part of the journey, they met witha Portuguese settler, who did more to open their eyes to the blightingand withering influence of slavery on the land and on its people thananything they had yet seen.Towards the afternoon of the first day on the Shire, they landed nearthe encampment of the settler referred to, who turned out to be agentleman of a Portuguese town on the Zambesi.Harold found, to his delight, that he could speak English fluently, andwas, moreover, an exceedingly agreeable and well-informed man.  He wasout at the time on a hunting expedition, attended by a party of slaves.Harold spent the evening in very pleasant intercourse with Senhor Gamba,and at a later hour than usual returned to his camp, where heentertained Disco with an account of his new acquaintance.While thus engaged, he was startled by the most appalling shrieks, whichproceeded from the neighbouring encampment.  Under the impression thatsomething was wrong, both he and Disco leaped up and ran towards it.There, to his amazement and horror, Harold beheld his agreeable friendSenhor Gamba thrashing a young slave unmercifully with a whip of themost formidable character.  Only a few lashes from it had been givenwhen Harold ran up, but these were so powerful that the unhappy victimdropped down in a state of insensibility just as he reached the spot.The Portuguese "gentleman" turned away from the prostrate slave with ascowl, but betrayed a slight touch of confusion on meeting the gaze ofHarold Seadrift."Senhor!" exclaimed the latter sternly, with mingled remonstrance andrebuke in his tone, "how _can_ you be so cruel?  What has the boy doneto merit such inhuman chastisement?""He has neglected my orders," answered the Portuguese, as though heresented the tone in which Harold spoke."But surely, surely," said Harold, "the punishment is far beyond theoffence.  I can scarcely believe the evidence of my own eyes and earswhen they tell me that _you_ have been guilty of this.""Come," returned Senhor Gamba, softening into a smile, "you Englishcannot understand our case in this land.  Because you do not keepslaves, you take the philanthropic, the religious view of the question.We who do keep slaves have a totally different experience.  You cannotunderstand, you cannot sympathise with us.""No, truly, we can _not_ understand you," said Harold earnestly, "andGod forbid that we should ever sympathise with you in this matter.  Wedetest the gross injustice of slavery, and we abhor the fearfulcruelties connected with it.""That is because, as I said, you are not in our position," rejoined theSenhor, with a shrug of his shoulders.  "It is easy for you to take thephilanthropic view, which, however, I admit to be the best, for in theeyes of God all men are equal, and though the African be a degraded man,I know enough of him to be sure that he can be raised by kindness andreligion into a position not very inferior to our own; but we who keepslaves cannot help ourselves we _must_ act as we do.""Why so?--is cruelty a necessity?" asked Harold."Yes, it is," replied the Senhor decidedly."Then the abolition of slavery is a needcessity too," growled Disco, whohad hitherto looked on and listened in silent wonder, debating withhimself as to the propriety of giving Senhor Gamba, then and there, asound thrashing with his own whip!"You see," continued the Portuguese, paying no attention to Disco'sgrowl,--"You see, in order to live out here I must have slaves, and inorder to keep slaves I must have a whip.  My whip is no worse than anyother whip that I know of.  I don't justify it as right, I simply defendit as necessary.  _Wherever slavery exists, discipline must of necessitybe brutal_.  If you keep slaves, and mean that they shall give you thelabour of their bodies, and of their minds also, in so far as you permitthem to have minds, you must degrade them by the whip and by all othermeans at your disposal until, like dogs, they become the unhesitatingservants of your will, no matter what that will may be, and live foryour pleasure only.  It will never pay me to adopt your philanthropic,your religious views.  I am here.  I _must_ be here.  What am I to do?Starve?  No, not if I can help it.  I do as others do--keep slaves andact as the master of slaves.  I must use the whip.  Perhaps you won'tbelieve me," continued Senhor Gamba, with a sad smile, "but I speaktruth when I say that I was tender-hearted when I first came to thiscountry, for I had been well nurtured in Lisbon; but that soon passedaway--it could not last.  I was the laughing-stock of my companions.Just to explain my position, I will tell you a circumstance whichhappened soon after I came here.  The Governor invited me to a party ofpleasure.  The party consisted of himself, his daughters, some officers,and others.  We were to go in boats to a favourite island resort,several miles off.  I took one of my slaves with me, a lad that I keptabout my person.  As we were going along, this lad fell into the river.He could not swim, and the tide was carrying him fast away to death.Dressed as I was, in full uniform, I plunged in after him and saved him.The wish alone to save the boy's life prompted me to risk my own.  Andfor this I became the jest of the party; even the ladies tittered at myfolly.  Next evening the Governor had a large dinner-party.  I wasthere.  Having caught cold, I coughed slightly; this drew attention tome.  Remarks were made, and the Governor alluded in scoffing terms to myexploit, which created much mirth.  `Were you drunk?' said one.  `Hadyou lost your senses, to risk your life for a brute of a negro?' saidanother.  `Rather than spoil my uniform, I would have knocked him on thehead with a pole,' said a third; and it was a long time before what theytermed my folly was forgotten or forgiven.  You think I am worse thanothers.  I am not; but I do not condescend to their hypocrisy.  What Iam now, I have been made by this country and its associates."  [Thesewords are not fictitious.  The remarks of Senhor Gamba were actuallyspoken by a Portuguese slave-owner, and will be found in _The Story ofthe Universities' Mission to Central Africa_, pages 64-5-6.]Senhor Gamba said this with the air of one who thinks that he hasnearly, if not quite, justified himself.  "I am no worse than others,"is an excuse for evil conduct, not altogether unknown in more highlyfavoured lands, and is often followed by the illogical conclusion,"therefore I am not to blame," but although Harold felt pity for hisagreeable chance acquaintance, he could not admit that this explanationexcused him, nor could he get over the shock which his feelings hadsustained; it was, therefore, with comparatively little regret that hebade him adieu on the following morning, and pursued his onward way.Everywhere along the Shire they met with a more or less hospitablereception from the natives, who regarded them with great favour, inconsequence of their belonging to the same nation which had sent forthmen to explore their country, defend them from the slave-dealer, andteach them about the true God.  These men, of whom mention is made inanother chapter, had, some time before this, been sent by the Church ofEngland to the Manganja highlands, at the suggestion of Dr Livingstone,and laid, we believe, the foundation-stone of Christian civilisation inthe interior of Africa, though God saw fit to arrest them in the raisingof the superstructure.Among other pieces of useful knowledge conveyed by them to the negroesof the Shire, was the fact that Englishmen are not cannibals, and thatthey have no special longings after black man steaks!It may perchance surprise some readers to learn that black men everentertain such a preposterous notion.  Nevertheless, it is literallytrue.  The slavers--Arabs and Portuguese--find it in their interest toinstil this falsehood into the minds of the ignorant tribes of theinterior, from whom the slaves are gathered, in order that theircaptives may entertain a salutary horror of Englishmen, so that if theirdhows should be chased by our cruisers while creeping northward alongthe coast and run the risk of being taken, the slaves may willingly aidtheir captors in trying to escape.  That the lesson has been well learntand thoroughly believed is proved by the fact that when a dhow isobliged to run ashore to avoid capture, the slaves invariably take tothe woods on the wings of terror, preferring, no doubt to be re-enslavedrather than to be roasted and eaten by white fiends.  Indeed, sothoroughly has this been engrained into the native mind, that mothersfrequently endeavour to overawe their refractory offspring bythreatening to hand them over to the dreadful white monster who will eatthem up if they don't behave!CHAPTER EIGHT.RELATES ADVENTURES IN THE SHIRE VALLEY, AND TOUCHES ON ONE OR TWO PHASESOF SLAVERY.Everything depends upon taste, as the monkey remarked when it took tonibbling the end of its own tail!  If you like a thing, you take oneview of it; if you don't like it, you take another view.  Either view,if detailed, would be totally irreconcilable with the other.The lower part of the river Shire, into which our travellers had nowentered, is a vast swamp.  There are at least two opinions in regard tothat region.  To do justice to those with whom we don't sympathise, wegive our opponent's view first.  Our opponent, observe, is an honest andcompetent man; he speaks truly; he only looks at it in another lightfrom Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer.He says of the river Shire, "It drains a low and exceedingly fertilevalley of from fifteen to twenty miles in breadth.  Ranges of woodedhills bound this valley on both sides.  After the first twenty miles youcome to Mount Morambala, which rises with steep sides to 4000 feet inheight.  It is wooded to the top, and very beautiful.  A small villagepeeps out about half-way up the mountain.  It has a pure, bracingatmosphere, and is perched above mosquito range.  The people on thesummit have a very different climate and vegetation from those on theplains, and they live amidst luxuriant vegetation.  There are manyspecies of ferns, some so large as to deserve the name of trees.  Thereare also lemon and orange trees growing wild, and birds and animals ofall kinds."  Thus far we agree with our opponent but listen to him as hegoes on:--"The view from Morambala is extensive, but cheerless past description.Swamp, swamp-reeking, festering, rotting, malaria-pregnant swamp, wherepoisonous vapours for several months in the year are ever bulging up andout into the air,--lies before you as far as the eye can reach, andfarther.  If you enter the river at the worst seasons of the year, thechances are you will take the worst type of fever.  If, on the otherhand, you enter it during the best season, when the swamps are fairlydried up, you have everything in your favour."Now, our opponent gives a true statement of facts undoubtedly, but hisview of them is not cheering.Contrast them with the view of Disco Lillihammer.  That sagacious seamanhad entered the Shire neither in the "best" nor the "worst" of theseason.  He had chanced upon it somewhere between the two."Git up your steam an' go 'longside," he said to Jumbo one afternoon, asthe two canoes were proceeding quietly among magnificent giant-reeds,sedges, and bulrushes, which towered high above them--in some placesoverhung them."I say, Mister Harold, ain't it splendid?""Magnificent!" replied Harold with a look of quiet enthusiasm."I _does_ enjoy a swamp," continued the seaman, allowing a thin cloud totrickle from his lips."So do I, Disco.""There's such a many outs and ins an' roundabouts in it.  And suchpowerful reflections o' them reeds in the quiet water.  W'y, sir, I dodeclare w'en I looks through 'em in a dreamy sort of way for a long timeI get to fancy they're palm-trees, an' that we're sailin' through aforest without no end to it; an' when I looks over the side an' seesevery reed standin' on its other self, so to speak, an' follers theunder one down till my eyes git lost in the blue sky an' clouds _below_us, I do sometimes feel as if we'd got into the middle of fairy-land,--was fairly afloat on the air, an' off on a voyage through the univarse!But it's them reflections as I like most.  Every leaf, an' stalk, an'flag is just as good an' real _in_ the water as out of it.  An' justlook at that there frog, sir, that one on the big leaf which has swelledhisself up as if he wanted to bust, with his head looking up hopefullyto the--ah! he's down with a plop like lead, but he wos sittin' on hisown image which wos as clear as his own self.  Then there's so muchvariety, sir--that's where it is.  You never know wot you're comin' toin them swamps.  It may be a openin' like a pretty lake, with islands ofreeds everywhere; or it may be a narrow bit like a canal, or a river; ora bit so close that you go scrapin' the gun'les on both sides.  An' thelife, too, is most amazin'.  Never saw nothin' like it nowhere.  Allkinds, big an' little, plain an' pritty, queer an' 'orrible, swarms hereto sitch an extent that I've got it into my head that this Shire valleymust be the great original nursery of animated nature.""It looks like it, Disco."The last idea appeared to furnish food for reflection, as the twofriends here relapsed into silence.Although Disco's description was quaint, it could scarcely be styledexaggerated, for the swamp was absolutely alive with animal life.  Theprincipal occupant of these marshes is the elephant, and hundreds ofthese monster animals may be seen in one herd, feeding like cattle in ameadow.  Owing to the almost impenetrable nature of the reedy jungle,however, it is impossible to follow them, and anxious though Disco wasto kill one, he failed to obtain a single shot.  Buffaloes and otherlarge game were also numerous in this region, and in the watercrocodiles and hippopotami sported about everywhere, while aquatic birdsof every shape and size rendered the air vocal with their cries.Sometimes these feathered denizens of the swamp arose, when startled, ina dense cloud so vast that the mighty rush of their wings was almostthunderous in character.The crocodiles were not only numerous but dangerous because of theiraudacity.  They used to watch at the places where native women were inthe habit of going down to the river for water, and not unfrequentlysucceeded in seizing a victim.  This, however, only happened at thoseperiods when the Shire was in flood, when fish were driven from theirwonted haunts, and the crocodiles were reduced to a state of starvationand consequent ferocity.One evening, while our travellers were proceeding slowly up stream, theyobserved the corpse of a negro boy floating past the canoe; just then amonstrous crocodile rushed at it with the speed of a greyhound, caughtit and shook it as a terrier does a rat.  Others dashed at the prey,each with his powerful tail causing the water to churn and froth as hetore off a piece.  In a few seconds all was gone.  [Livingstone's_Zambesi and its Tributaries_, page 452.] That same evening Zombo had anarrow escape.  After dusk he ran down to the river to drink.  Hechanced to go to a spot where a crocodile was watching.  It lay settleddown in the mud with its head on a level with the water, so that in thefeeble light it could not be seen.  While Zombo was busy laving thewater into his mouth it suddenly rushed at him and caught him by thehand.  The limb of a bush was fortunately within reach, and he laid holdof it.  There was a brief struggle.  The crocodile tugged hard, but theman tugged harder; at the same time he uttered a yell which broughtJumbo to his side with an oar, a blow from which drove the hideousreptile away.  Poor Zombo was too glad to have escaped with his life tocare much about the torn hand, which rendered him _hors de combat_ forsome time after that.Although Disco failed to get a shot at an elephant, his hopeful spiritwas gratified by the catching of a baby elephant alive.  It happenedthus:--One morning, not very long after Zombo's tussle with the crocodile,Disco's canoe, which chanced to be in advance, suddenly ran almost intothe midst of a herd of elephants which were busy feeding on palm-nuts,of which they are very fond.  Instantly the whole troop scattered andfled.  Disco, taken completely by surprise, omitted his wonted "Hallo!"as he made an awkward plunge at his rifle, but before he could bring itto bear, the animals were over the bank of the river and lost in thedense jungle.  But a fine little elephant, at that period of life which,in human beings, might be styled the toddling age, was observed tostumble while attempting to follow its mother up the bank.  It fell androlled backwards."Give way for your lives!" roared Disco.The boat shot its bow on the bank, and the seaman flew rather thanleaped upon the baby elephant!The instant it was laid hold of it began to scream with incessant andpiercing energy after the fashion of a pig."Queek! come in canoe!  Modder come back for 'im," cried Jumbo in someanxiety.Disco at once appreciated the danger of the enraged mother returning tothe rescue, but, resolved not to resign his advantage, he seized thevicious little creature by the proboscis and dragged it by main force tothe canoe, into which he tumbled, hauled the proboscis inboard, asthough it had been the bite of a cable, and held on."Shove off! shove off! and give way, lads!  Look alive!"The order was promptly obeyed, and in a few minutes the baby was draggedinto the boat and secured.This prize, however, was found to be more of a nuisance than anamusement and it was soon decided that it must be disposed of.Accordingly, that very night, much to the regret of the men who wantedto make a meal of it, Disco led his baby squealing into the jungle andset it free with a hearty slap on the flank, and an earnestrecommendation to make all sail after its venerable mother, which it didforthwith, cocking its ears and tail, and shrieking as it went.Two days after this event they made a brief halt at a poor village wherethey were hospitably received by the chief, who was much gratified bythe liberal quantity of calico with which the travellers paid for theirentertainment.  Here they met with a Portuguese half-caste who wasreputed one of the greatest monsters of cruelty in that part of thecountry.  He was, however, not much more villainous in aspect than manyother half-castes whom they saw.  He was on his way to the coast in acanoe manned by slaves.  If Harold and Disco had known that this was hislast journey to the coast they would have regarded him with greaterinterest.  As it was, having learned his history from the chief throughtheir interpreter, they turned from him with loathing.As this half-caste's career illustrates the depths to which humanity mayfall in the hot-bed of slavery, as well as, to some extent, the state ofthings existing under Portuguese rule on the east coast of Africa, wegive the particulars briefly.Instead of the whip, this man used the gun, which he facetiously styledhis "minister of justice," and, in mere wantonness, he was known to havecommitted murder again and again, yet no steps were taken by theauthorities to restrain, much less to punish him.  Men heard of hismurders, but they shrugged their shoulders and did nothing.  It was onlya wild beast of a negro that was killed, they said, and what was that!They seemed to think less of it than if he had shot a hippopotamus.  Oneof his murders was painfully notorious, even to its minutestparticulars.  Over the female slaves employed in a house and adjacentlands there is usually placed a head-woman, a slave also, chosen forsuch an office for her blind fidelity to her master.  This man had onesuch woman, one who had ever been faithful to him and his interests, whohad never provoked him by disobedience or ill-conduct, and against whom,therefore, he could have no cause of complaint.  One day when half drunkhe was lying on a couch in his house; his forewoman entered and madeherself busy with some domestic work.  As her master lay watching her,his savage disposition found vent in a characteristic joke: "Woman,"said he, "I think I will shoot you."  The woman turned round and said,"Master, I am your slave; you can do what you will with me.  You cankill me if you like; I can do nothing.  But don't kill me, master, forif you do, who is there to look after your other women? they will allrun away from you."She did not mean to irritate her master, but instantly the man's brutalegotism was aroused.  The savage jest became a fearful reality, and heshouted with rage:--"Say you that! say you that! fetch me my gun.  I will see if my womenwill run away after I have killed you."Trained to implicit obedience, the poor woman did as she was bid.  Shebrought the gun and handed him powder and ball.  At his command sheknelt down before him, and the wretch fired at her breast.  In hisdrunken rage he missed his mark--the ball went through her shoulder.She besought him to spare her.  Deaf to her entreaties, he ordered herto fetch more powder and ball.  Though wounded and in agony, she obeyedhim.  Again the gun was loaded, again levelled and fired, and the womanfell dead at his feet.  [The above narrative is quoted almost _verbatim_from _The Story of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa_, pages78 and 79, the author of which vouches for its accuracy.]The facts of this case were known far and wide.  The Portuguese Governorwas acquainted with them, as well as the ministers of justice, but noone put forth a hand to punish the monster, or to protect his slaves.But vengeance overtook him at last.  On his way down the Zambesi he shotone of his men.  The others, roused to irresistible fury, sprang uponhim and strangled him._Then_, indeed, the Governor and Magistrates were roused to administer"justice!"  They had allowed this fiend to murder slaves at his will,but no sooner had the slaves turned on and killed their master thanceaseless energy and resolution were displayed in punishing those whoslew him.  Soldiers were sent out in all directions; some of thecanoe-men were shot down like wild beasts, the rest were recaptured andpublicly whipped to death!Reader, this is "domestic slavery."  This is what Portugal and Zanzibarclaim the right to practise.  This is what Great Britain has for manyyears declined to interfere with.  This is the curse with which Africais blighted at the present day in some of her fairest lands, and this iswhat Portugal has decreed shall not terminate in what she calls herAfrican dominions for some years to come.  In other words, it has beencoolly decreed by that weakest of all the European nations, thatslavery, murder, injustice, and every other conceivable andunmentionable vice and villainy shall still, for some considerable time,continue to be practised on the men, women, and children of Africa!Higher up the Shire river, the travellers saw symptoms of recentdistress among the people, which caused them much concern.  Chimbolo, inparticular, was rendered very anxious by the account given of the faminewhich prevailed still farther up the river, and the numerous deaths thathad taken place in consequence.The cause of the distress was a common one, and easily explained.Slave-dealers had induced the Ajawa, a warlike tribe, to declare waragainst the people of the Manganja highlands.  The Ajawa had done thisbefore, and were but too ready to do it again.  They invaded the land,captured many of the young people, and slew the aged.  Those who escapedto the jungle found on their return that their crops were destroyed.Little seed remained in their possession, and before that was plantedand grown, famine began to reduce the ranks, already thinned by war.Indications of this sad state of things became more numerous as thetravellers advanced.  Few natives appeared to greet them on the banks ofthe river as they went along, and these few resembled living skeletons.In many places they found dead bodies lying on the ground in variousstages of decomposition, and everywhere they beheld an aspect of settledunutterable despair on the faces of the scattered remnant of thebereaved and starving people.It was impossible, in the circumstances, for Harold Seadrift to givethese wretched people more than very slight relief.  He gave them asmuch of his stock of provisions as he could spare, and was glad when thenecessity of continuing the journey on foot relieved him from suchmournful scenes by taking him away from the river's bank.Hiring a party of the strongest men that he could find among them, he atlength left his canoes, made up his goods, food, and camp-equipage intobundles of a shape and size suitable to being carried on the heads ofmen, and started on foot for the Manganja highlands."Seems to me, sir," observed Disco, as they plodded along together onthe first morning of the land journey--"seems to me, sir, that Chimbolodon't stand much chance of findin' his wife alive.""Poor fellow," replied Harold, glancing back at the object of theirremarks, "I fear not."Chimbolo had by that time recovered much of his natural vigour, andalthough not yet able to carry a man's load, was nevertheless quitecapable of following the party.  He walked in silence, with his eyes onthe ground, a few paces behind Antonio, who was a step or two in rear ofhis leader, and who, in virtue of his position as "bo's'n" to the party,was privileged to walk hampered by no greater burden than his gun."We must keep up his sperrits, tho', poor chap," said Disco, in thehoarse whisper with which he was wont to convey secret remarks, andwhich was much more fitted to attract attention than his ordinary voice."It 'ud never do to let his sperrits down; 'cause w'y? he's weak, an'if he know'd that his wife was dead, or took off as a slave, he'd neverbe able to go along with us, and we couldn't leave him to starve here,you know.""Certainly not, Disco," returned Harold.  "Besides, his wife _may_ bealive, for all we know to the contrary.--How far did he say the villagewas from where we landed, Antonio?""'Bout two, t'ree days," answered the bo's'n.That night the party encamped beside the ruins of a small hamlet wherecharred sticks and fragments of an African household's goods andchattels lay scattered on the ground.Chimbolo sat down here on the ground, and, resting his chin on hisknees, gazed in silence at the ruin around him."Come, cheer up, old fellow," cried Disco, with rather an awkward effortat heartiness, as he slapped the negro gently on the shoulder; "tellhim, Antonio, not to let his heart go down.  Didn't he say thatwhat-dee-call-the-place--his village--was a strong place, and could beeasily held by a few brave men?""True," replied Chimbolo, through the interpreter, "but the Manganja menare not very brave.""Well, well, never mind," rejoined the sympathetic tar, repeating hispat on the back, "there's no sayin'.  P'raps they got courage w'en itcame to the scratch.  P'raps it never came to the scratch at all upthere.  Mayhap you'll find 'em all right after all.  Come, never say dies'long as there's a shot in the locker.  That's a good motto for 'ee,Chimbolo, and ought to keep up your heart even tho' ye _are_ a nigger,'cause it wos inwented by the great Nelson, and shouted by him, or hisbo's'n, just before he got knocked over at the glorious battle ofTrafalgar.  Tell him that, Antonio."Whether Antonio told him all that, is extremely doubtful, although hecomplied at once with the order, for Antonio never by any chancedeclined at least to attempt the duties of his station, but the onlyeffect of his speech was that Chimbolo shook his head and continued tostare at the ruins.Next morning they started early, and towards evening drew near to Zomba.The country through which, during the previous two days, they hadtravelled, was very beautiful, and as wild as even Disco could desire--and, by the way, it was no small degree of wildness that could slake thethirst for the marvellous which had been awakened in the breast of ourtar, by his recent experiences in Africa.  It was, he said--and saidtruly--a real out-and-out wilderness.  There were villages everywhere,no doubt but these were so thickly concealed by trees and jungle thatthey were not easily seen, and most of them were at that time almostdepopulated.  The grass was higher than the heads of the travellers, andthe vegetation everywhere was rankly luxuriant.  Here and there openglades allowed the eye to penetrate into otherwise impenetrable bush.Elsewhere, large trees abounded in the midst of overwhelminglyaffectionate parasites, whose gnarled lower limbs and twining tendrilsand pendant foliage gave a softness to the landscape, which contrastedwell with the wild passes and rugged rocks of the middle distance, andthe towering mountains which rose, range beyond range, in the fardistance.But as the party approached the neighbourhood of Zomba mountains, few ofthem were disposed to give much heed to the beauties of nature.  Allbeing interested in Chimbolo, they became more or less anxious as tonews that awaited him.On turning a spur of one of the mountains which had hitherto barredtheir vision, they found themselves suddenly face to face with a smallband of Manganja men, whose woe-begone countenances told too eloquentlythat the hand of the destroyer had been heavy upon them.Of course they were questioned by Chimbolo, and the replies they gavehim were such as to confirm the fears he had previously entertained.The Ajawa, they said, had, just the day before, burnt their villages,stolen or destroyed their property, killed many of their kinsmen, andcarried off their wives and children for slaves.  They themselves hadescaped, and were now on their way to visit their chief, who was at thattime on the banks of the Zambesi, to beg of him to return, in order thathe might bewitch the guns of the Ajawa, and so render them harmless!"Has a woman of your tribe, named Marunga, been slain or captured?"asked Chimbolo eagerly.To this the men replied that they could not tell.  Marunga, they said,was known well to them by name and sight.  They did not think she wasamong the captives, but could not tell what had become of her, as thevillage where she and her little boy lived had been burnt, and all whohad not been killed or captured had taken to the bush.  Marunga'shusband, they added, was a man named Chimbolo--not a Manganja man, but afriend of the tribe--who had been taken by the slavers, under command ofa Portuguese half-caste named Marizano, about two years before thattime.Chimbolo winced as though he had been stung when Marizano's name wasmentioned, and a dark frown contracted his brows when he told theManganja men that _he_ was Chimbolo, and that he was even then in searchof Marunga and her little boy.When all this had been explained to Harold Seadrift he told the men thatit was a pity to waste time in travelling such a long way to see theirchief, who could not, even if he wished, bewitch the guns of the Ajawa,and advised them to turn back and guide him and his men to the placewhere the attack had been made on the Manganja, so that a search mightbe made in the bush for those of the people who had escaped.This was agreed to, and the whole party proceeded on their way withincreased speed, Chimbolo and Harold hoping they might yet find thatMarunga had escaped, and Disco earnestly desiring that they might onlyfall in with the Ajawa and have a brush with them, in which case heassured the negroes he would show them a way of bewitching their gunsthat would beat their chief's bewitchment all to sticks and stivers!The village in which Marunga had dwelt was soon reached.  It was, asthey had been told by their new friends, a heap of still smoulderingashes; but it was not altogether destitute of signs of life.  A dog wasobserved to slink away into the bush as they approached.The moment Chimbolo observed it he darted into the bush after it."Hallo!" exclaimed Disco in surprise; "that nigger seems to have took asudden fancy to the cur?--Eh, Antonio, wot's the reason of that, think'ee?""Dunno; s'pose where dog be mans be?""Ah! or womans," suggested Disco."Or womans," assented Antonio.Just then they heard Chimbolo's shout, which was instantly followed by asuccession of female shrieks.  These latter were repeated several times,and sounded as though the fugitives were scattering."Hims find a nest of womins!" exclaimed Jumbo, throwing down his loadand dashing away into the bush.Every individual of the party followed his example, not excepting Haroldand Disco, the latter of whom was caught by the leg, the moment he leftthe track, by a wait-a-bit thorn--most appropriately so-called, becauseits powerful spikes are always ready to seize and detain the unwarypasser-by.  In the present instance it checked the seaman's career for afew seconds, and rent his nether garments sadly; while Harold, profitingby his friend's misfortune, leaped over the bush, and passed on.  Discoquickly extricated himself, and followed.They were not left far behind, and overtook their comrades just as theyemerged on an open space, or glade, at the extremity of which a sightmet their eyes that filled them with astonishment, for there a troop ofwomen and one or two boys were seen walking towards them, with Chimboloin front, having a child on his left shoulder, and performing a sort ofinsane war-dance round one of the women."He's catched her!" exclaimed Disco, with excited looks, just as ifChimbolo had been angling unsuccessfully for a considerable time, andhad hooked a stupendous fish at last.And Disco was right.  A few of the poor creatures who were so recentlyburnt out of their homes, and had lost most of those dearest to them,had ventured, as if drawn by an irresistible spell, to return with timidsteps to the scene of their former happiness, but only to have theirworst fears confirmed.  Their homes, their protectors, their children,their hopes, all were gone at one fell swoop.  Only one among them--onewho, having managed to save her only child, had none to mourn over, andno one to hope to meet with--only one returned to a joyful meeting.  Weneed scarcely say that this was Marunga.The fact was instantly made plain to the travellers by the wild mannerin which Chimbolo shouted her name, pointed to her, and danced roundher, while he showed all his glistening teeth and as much of the whitesof his eyes as was consistent with these members remaining in theirorbits.Really it was quite touching, in spite of its being ludicrous, the wayin which the poor fellow poured forth his joy like a very child,--whichhe was in everything except years; and Harold could not helpremembering, and recalling to Disco's memory, Yoosoof's observationstouching the hardness of negroes' hearts, and their want of naturalaffection, on the morning when his dhow was captured by the boat of the"Firefly."The way in which, ever and anon, Chimbolo kissed his poor but now happywife, was wondrously similar to the mode in which white men perform thatlittle operation, except that there was more of an unrefined smack init.  The tears which _would_ hop over his sable cheeks now and thensparkled to the full as brightly as European tears, and were perhapssomewhat bigger; and the pride with which he regarded his little son,holding him in both hands out at arms'-length, was only excelled by thejoy and the tremendous laugh with which he received a kick on the nosefrom that undutiful son's black little toes.But Yoosoof never chanced to be present when such exhibitions of negrofeeling and susceptibility took place.  How could he, seeing that menand women and children--if black--fled from him, and such as he, inabject terror?  Neither did Yoosoof ever chance to be present when womensat down beside their blackened hearths, as they did that night, andquietly wept as though their hearts would burst at the memory of littlevoices and manly tones--not silent in death, but worse than that--gone,gone _for ever_!  Doubtless they felt though they never heard of, andcould not in words express, the sentiment--  "Oh for the touch of a vanished hand,  And the sound of a voice that is still."Yoosoof knew not of, and cared nothing for, such feelings as these.  Weask again, how could he?  His only experience of the negro was whencowering before him as a slave, or when yelling in agony under histerrible lash, or when brutalised and rendered utterly apathetic byinhuman cruelty.Harold learned, that night on further conversation with the Manganjamen, that a raid had recently been made into those regions by more thanone band of slavers, sent out to capture men and women by the Portuguesehalf-castes of the towns of Senna and Tette, on the Zambesi, and thatthey had been carrying the inhabitants out of the country at the rate ofabout two hundred a week.This however was but a small speck, so to speak, of the mighty work ofkidnapping human beings that was going on--that is _still_ going on inthose regions.  Yoosoof would have smiled--he never laughed--if you hadmentioned such a number as being large.But in truth he cared nothing about such facts, except in so far as theyrepresented a large amount of profit accrueing to himself.The result of Harold Seadrift's cogitations on these matters was that heresolved to pass through as much of the land as he could within areasonable time, and agreed to accompany Chimbolo on a visit to histribe, which dwelt at some distance to the north of the Manganjahighlands.CHAPTER NINE.IN WHICH A SAVAGE CHIEF ASTONISHES A SAVAGE ANIMAL.There is something exceedingly pleasant in the act of watching--ourselves unseen--the proceedings of some one whose aims and ends appearto be very mysterious.  There is such a wide field of speculation openedup in which to expatiate, such a vast amount of curious, we had almostsaid romantic, expectation created; all the more if the individual whomwe observe be a savage, clothed in an unfamiliar and very scanty garb,and surrounded by scenery and circumstances which, albeit strange to us,are evidently by no means new to him.Let us--you and me, reader,--quitting for a time the sad subject ofslavery, and leaping, as we are privileged to do, far ahead of ourexplorers Harold Seadrift and his company, into the region of CentralAfrica; let you and me take up a position in a clump of trees by thebanks of yonder stream, and watch the proceedings of that negro--negrochief let me say, for he looks like one,--who is engaged in somemysterious enterprise under the shade of a huge baobab tree.The chief is a fine, stately, well-developed specimen of Africanmanhood.  He is clothed in black tights manufactured in nature's loom,in addition to which he wears round his loins a small scrap ofartificial cotton cloth.  If an enthusiastic member of the Royal Academywere in search of a model which should combine the strength of Herculeswith the grace of Apollo, he could not find a better than the man beforeus, for, you will observe, the more objectionable points about _our_ideal of the negro are not very prominent in him.  His lips are notthicker than the lips of many a roast-beef-loving John Bull.  His noseis not flat, and his heels do not protrude unnecessarily.  True, hishair is woolly, but that is scarcely a blemish.  It might almost beregarded as the crisp and curly hair that surrounds a manly skull.  Hisskin is black--no doubt about that, but then it is _intensely_ black andglossy, suggestive of black satin, and having no savour of thatdirtiness which is inseparably connected with whitey-brown.  Tribes inAfrica differ materially in many respects, physically and mentally, justas do the various tribes of Europe.This chief, as we have hinted, is a "savage;" that is to say, he differsin many habits and points from "civilised" people.  Among otherpeculiarities, he clothes himself and his family in the fashion that isbest suited to the warm climate in which he dwells.  This display ofwisdom is, as you know, somewhat rare among civilised people, as any onemay perceive who observes how these over-clothe the upper parts of theirchildren, and leave their tender little lower limbs exposed to therigours of northern latitudes, while, as if to make up for thisinconsistency by an inconsistent counterpoise, they swathe their owntough and mature limbs in thick flannel from head to foot.It is however simple justice to civilised people to add here that a fewof them, such as a portion of the Scottish Highlanders, are consistentinasmuch as the men clothe themselves similarly to the children.Moreover, our chief, being a savage, takes daily a sufficient amount offresh air and exercise, which nine-tenths of civilised men refrain fromdoing, on the economic and wise principle, apparently, that engrossingand unnatural devotion to the acquisition of wealth, fame, or knowledge,will enable them at last to spend a few paralytic years in the enjoymentof their gains.  No doubt civilised people have the trifling littledrawback of innumerable ills, to which they say (erroneously, we think)that flesh is heir, and for the cure of which much of their wealth isspent in supporting an army of doctors.  Savages know nothing ofindigestion, and in Central Africa they have no medical men.There is yet another difference which we may point out: savages have noliterature.  They cannot read or write therefore, and have no permanentrecords of the deeds of their forefathers.  Neither have they anyreligion worthy of the name.  This is indeed a serious evil, one whichcivilised people of course deplore, yet, strange to say, one whichconsistency prevents some civilised people from remedying in the case ofAfrican savages, for it would be absurdly inconsistent in ArabMohammedans to teach the negroes letters and the doctrines of theirfaith with one hand, while with the other they lashed them to death ordragged them into perpetual slavery; and it would be equallyinconsistent in Portuguese Christians to teach the negroes to read"Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so tothem," while "domestic slavery" is, in their so-called Africanterritories, claimed as a right and the traffic connected with itsanctioned.Yes, there are many points of difference between civilised people andsavages, and we think it right to point this out very clearly, goodreader, because the man at whom you and I are looking just now is asavage.Of course, being capable of reading this book, you are too old torequire to be told that there is nothing of our _nursery_ savage abouthim.  That peculiar abortion was born and bred in the nursery, anddwells only there, and was never heard of beyond civilised lands--although something not unlike him, alas! may be seen here and thereamong the lanes and purlieus where our drunkards and profligates resort.No; our savage chief does not roar, or glare, or chatter, or devour hisfood in its blood like the giant of the famous Jack.  He carries himselflike a man, and a remarkably handsome man too, with his body firm andupright, and his head bent a little forward, with his eyes fixed on theground, as if in meditation, while he walks along.But a truce to digressive explanation.  Let us follow him.Reaching the banks of the river, he stops, and, standing in an attitudeworthy of Apollo, though he is not aware that we are looking at him,gazes first up the stream and then down.  This done, he looks across,after which he tries to penetrate the depths of the water with his eye.As no visible result follows, he wisely gives up staring and wishing,and apparently resolves to attain his ends by action.  Felling a smalltree, about as thick as his thigh, with an iron hatchet he cuts off it alength of about six feet.  Into one end of this he drives asharp-pointed hard-wood spike, several inches long, and to the other endattaches a stout rope made of the fibrous husk of the cocoa-nut.  Thepoint of the spike he appears to anoint--probably a charm of somekind,--and then suspends the curious instrument over a forked stick at aconsiderable height from the ground, to which he fastens the other endof the rope.  This done, he walks quietly away with an air of as muchself-satisfaction as if he had just performed a generous deed.Well, is that all?  Nay, if that were all we should owe you a humbleapology.  Our chief, "savage" though he be, is not insane.  He _has_ anobject in view--which is more than can be said of everybody.He has not been long gone, an hour or two, when the smooth surface ofthe river is broken in several places, and out burst two or three headsof hippopotami.  Although, according to Disco Lillihammer, thepersonification of ugliness, these creatures do not the less enjoy theirexistence.  They roll about in the stream like puncheons, dive under oneanother playfully, sending huge waves to the banks on either side.  Theygape hideously with their tremendous jaws, which look as though they hadbeen split much too far back in the head by a rude hatchet--the tops ofall the teeth having apparently been lopped off by the same clumsy blow.They laugh too, with a demoniacal "Ha! ha! ha!" as if they rejoiced intheir excessive plainness, and knew that we--you and I, reader--areregarding them with disgust, not unmingled with awe.Presently one of the herd betakes himself to the land.  He is tired ofplay, and means to feed.  Grass appears to be his only food, and toprocure this he must needs go back from the river a short way, hisenormous lips, like an animated mowing-machine, cutting a track of shortcropped grass as he waddles along.The form of that part of the bank is such that he is at least inclined,if not constrained, to pass directly under the suspended beam.  Ha! weunderstand the matter now.  Most people do understand, when a thingbecomes obviously plain.  The hippopotamus wants grass for supper; the"savage" chief wants hippopotamus.  Both set about arranging their plansfor their respective ends.  The hippopotamus passes close to the forkedstick, and touches the cord which sustains it in air like the sword ofDamocles.  Down comes the beam, driving the spike deep into his back.  Acry follows, something between a grunt, a squeak, and a yell, and thewounded animal falls, rolls over, jumps up, with unexpected agility forsuch a sluggish, unwieldy creature, and rumbles, rushes, rolls, andstumbles back into the river, where his relatives take to flight inmortal terror.  The unfortunate beast might perhaps recover from thewound, were it not that the spike has been tipped with poison.  Theresult is that he dies in about an hour.  Not long afterwards the chiefreturns with a band of his followers, who, being experts in the use ofthe knife and hatchet, soon make mince-meat of their game--laden withwhich they return in triumph to their homes.Let us follow them thither.CHAPTER TEN.DESCRIBES AFRICAN DOMESTICITY, AND MANY OTHER THINGS RELATIVE THERETO,BESIDES SHOWING THAT ALARMS AND FLIGHTS, SURPRISES AND FEASTS, ARE NOTCONFINED TO PARTICULAR PLACES.When our negro chief--whose name, by the way, was Kambira--left thebanks of the river, followed by his men bearing the hippopotamus-flesh,he set off at a swinging pace, like to a man who has a considerable walkbefore him.The country through which they passed was not only well wooded, but wellwatered by numerous rivulets.  Their path for some distance tendedupwards towards the hills, now crossing over mounds, anon skirting thebase of precipitous rocks, and elsewhere dipping down into hollows; butalthough thus serpentine in its course, its upward tendency never varieduntil it led them to the highest parts of a ridge from which amagnificent prospect was had of hill and dale, lake, rivulet and river,extending so far that the distant scenery at the horizon appeared of athin pearly-grey colour, and of the same consistency as the clouds withwhich it mingled.Passing over this ridge, and descending into a wide valley which wasfertilised and beautified by a moderately-sized rivulet, Kambira led hisfollowers towards a hamlet which lay close to the stream, nestled in awoody hollow, and, like all other Manganja villages, was surrounded byan impenetrable hedge of poisonous euphorbia--a tree which casts a deepshade, and renders it difficult for bowmen to aim at the people inside.In the immediate vicinity of the village the land was laid out in littlegardens and fields, and in these the people--men, women, and children,--were busily engaged in hoeing the ground, weeding, planting, orgathering the fruits of their labour.These same fruits were plentiful, and the people sang with joy as theyworked.  There were large crops of maize, millet beans, and ground-nuts;also patches of yams, rice, pumpkins, cucumbers, cassava, sweetpotatoes, tobacco, cotton, and hemp, which last is also called "bang,"and is smoked by the natives as a species of tobacco.It was a pleasant sight for Kambira and his men to look upon, as theyrested for a few minutes on the brow of a knoll near a thicket ofbramble bushes, and gazed down upon their home.  Doubtless they thoughtso, for their eyes glistened, so also did their teeth when theysmilingly commented on the scene before them.  They did not, indeed,become enthusiastic about scenery, nor did they refer to the picturesquegrouping of huts and trees, or make any allusion whatever to light andshade; no, their thoughts were centred on far higher objects than these.They talked of wives and children, and hippopotamus-flesh; and theircountenances glowed--although they were not white--and their stronghearts beat hard against their ribs--although they were not clothed, andtheir souls (for we repudiate Yoosoof's opinion that they had none),their souls appeared to take quiet but powerful interest in theirbelongings.It was pleasant also, for Kambira and his men to listen to the soundsthat floated up from the valley,--sweeter far than the sweetest strainsof Mozart or Mendelssohn,--the singing of the workers in the fields andgardens, mellowed by distance into a soft humming tone; and the heartylaughter that burst occasionally from men seated at work on bows,arrows, fishing-nets, and such-like gear, on a flat green spot under theshade of a huge banyan-tree, which, besides being the village workshop,was the village reception-hall, where strangers were entertained onarriving,--also the village green, where the people assembled to dance,and sing, and smoke "bang," to which last they were much addicted, andto drink beer made by themselves, of which they were remarkably fond,and by means of which they sometimes got drunk;--in all which mattersthe intelligent reader will not fail to observe that they bore a markedresemblance to many of the civilised European nations, except, perhaps,in their greater freedom of action, lightness of costume, and colour ofskin.The merry voices of children, too, were heard, and their active littleblack bodies were seen, while they engaged in the play of savages--though not necessarily in savage play.  Some romped, ran after eachother, caught each other, tickled each other, occasionally whacked eachother--just as our own little ones do.  Others played at games, of whichthe skipping-rope was a decided favourite among the girls, but the playof most of the older children consisted in imitating the serious work oftheir parents.  The girls built little huts, hoed little gardens, madesmall pots of clay, pounded imaginary corn in miniature mortars, cookedit over ideal fires, and crammed it down the throats of imitationbabies; while the boys performed deeds of chivalric daring with reedspears, small shields, and tiny bows and arrows, or amused themselves inmaking cattle-pens, and in sculpturing cows and crocodiles.  Humannature, in short, was powerfully developed, without anything particularto suggest the idea of "savage" life, or to justify the opinion of Arabsand half-caste Portuguese that black men are all "cattle."The scene wanted only the spire of a village church and the tinkle of aSabbath bell to make it perfect.But there _was_ a tinkle among the other sounds, not unlike a bell whichwould have sounded marvellously familiar to English ears had they beenlistening.  This was the ringing of the anvil of the village blacksmith.Yes, savage though they were, these natives had a blacksmith whowrought in iron, almost as deftly, and to the full as vigorously, as anyBritish son of Vulcan.  The Manganja people are an industrious race.Besides cultivating the soil extensively, they dig iron-ore out of thehills, and each village has its smelting-house, its charcoal-burners,its forge with a pair of goatskin bellows, and its blacksmith--we mightappropriately say, its _very_ blacksmith!  Whether the latter would ofnecessity, and as a matter of course, sing bass in church if the landwere civilised enough to possess a church, remains to be seen!  At thetime we write of he merely hummed to the sound of the hammer, and forgedhoes, axes, spears, needles, arrow-heads, bracelets, armlets, necklets,and anklets, with surprising dexterity.Pity that he could not forge a chain which would for ever restrain themurderous hands of the Arabs and half-caste Portuguese, who, for ages,have blighted his land with their pestilential presence!After contemplating the picture for a time, Kambira descended thewinding path that led to the village.  He had not proceeded far when oneof the smallest of the children--a creature so rotund that his body andlimbs were a series of circles and ovals, and so black that it seemed anabsurdity even to think of casting a shadow on him--espied the advancingparty, uttered a shrill cry of delight, and ran towards them.His example was followed by a dozen others, who, being larger, outranhim, and, performing a war-dance round the men, possessed themselves, byamicable theft, of pieces of raw meat with which they hastened back tothe village.  The original discoverer of the party, however, had otherends in view.  He toddled straight up to Kambira with the outstretchedarms of a child who knows he will be welcomed.Kambira was not demonstrative, but he was hearty.  Taking the littleball of black butter by the arms, he whirled him over his head, andplaced him on his broad shoulders, with a fat leg on each side of hisneck, and left him there to look after himself.  This the youngster didby locking his feet together under the man's chin, and fastening his fatfingers in his woolly hair, in which position he bore some resemblanceto an enormous chignon.Thus was he borne crowing to the chief's hut, from the door of which avery stout elderly woman came out to receive them.There was no one else in the hut to welcome them, but Yohama, as thechief styled her, was sufficient; she was what some people call "goodcompany."  She bustled about making preparations for a feast, with adegree of activity that was quite surprising in one so fat--so veryfat--asking questions the while with much volubility, making remarks tothe child, criticising the hippopotamus-meat, or commenting on things ingeneral.Meanwhile Kambira seated himself in a corner and prepared to refreshhimself with a pipe of bang in the most natural and civilised fashionimaginable; and young Obo--for so Yohama called him--entered upon aseries of gymnastic exercises with his father--for such Kambira was--which partook of the playfulness of the kitten, mingled with theeccentricity and mischief of the monkey.It would have done you good, reader, if you possess a spark of sympathy,to have watched these two as they played together.  The way in which Oboassaulted his father, on whose visage mild benignity was enthroned,would have surprised you.  Kambira was a remarkably grave, quiet andreserved man, but that was a matter of no moment to Obo, who threatenedhim in front, skirmished in his rear, charged him on the right flankwith a reed spear, shelled him on the left with sweet potatoes, andotherwise harassed him with amazing perseverance and ingenuity.To this the enemy paid no further attention than lay in thrusting out anelbow and raising a knee, to check an unusually fierce attack, or ingiving Obo a pat on the back when he came within reach, or sending apuff of smoke in his face, as if to taunt and encourage him to attemptfurther deeds of daring.While this was going on in the chief's hut, active culinary preparationswere progressing all over the village--the women forsook their hoes andgrinding-mortars, and the looms on which they had been weaving cottoncloth, the men laid down various implements of industry, and, long erethe sun began to descend in the west, the entire tribe was feasting withall the gusto, and twenty times the appetite, of aldermen.During the progress of the feast a remarkably small, wiry old negro,entertained the chief and his party with a song, accompanying himselfthe while on a violin--not a European fiddle, by any means, but a nativeproduction--with something like a small keg, covered with goatskin, fora body, a longish handle, and one string which was played with a bow bythe "Spider."  Never having heard his name, we give him one inaccordance with his aspect.Talk of European fiddlers!  No Paganini, or any other _nini_ that everastonished the Goths and Vandals of the north, could hold a candle--wehad almost said a fiddle--to this sable descendant of Ham, who, squattedon his hams in the midst of an admiring circle, drew forth sounds fromhis solitary string that were more than exquisite,--they wereexcruciating.The song appeared to be improvised, for it referred to objects around,as well as to things past, present, and to come; among others, to thefact that slave parties attacked villages and carried off theinhabitants.At such points the minstrel's voice became low and thrilling, while hisaudience grew suddenly earnest, opened their eyes, frowned, and showedtheir teeth; but as soon as the subject was changed the feeling seemedto die away.  It was only old memories that had been awakened, for noslavers had passed through their country for some time past, thoughrumours of an attack on a not very distant tribe had recently reachedand greatly alarmed them.Thus they passed the afternoon, and when the cool of the evening drew ona dance was proposed, seconded, and carried unanimously.They were about to begin when a man was seen running down the pathleading to the village at a speed which proved him to be the bearer oftidings.  In a few minutes he burst into the midst of them with glaringeyeballs and labouring chest--for he had run fast, though not far, andtold his news in rapid short sentences--to the effect that a band ofslavers, led by Portuguese, were on their way to the valley, within amile or so of it, even while he spoke; that he thought the leader wasMarizano; and that they were _armed with the loud-sounding guns_!The consternation consequent on this news was universal, and there wasgood ground for it, because Marizano was a well-known monster ofcruelty, and his guns had rendered him invincible hitherto, wherever hewent, the native spear and bow being utterly useless in the hands of menwho, however courageous, were shot down before they could come withinarrow-range of their enemies.It is the custom of the slave-dealers, on going into the interior forthe purpose of procuring slaves, to offer to buy them from such tribesas are disposed to sell.  This most of the tribes are willing to do.Fathers do not indeed, sell their own children, or husbands their wives,from preference, but chiefs and head-men are by no means loath to getrid of their criminals in this way--their bad stock, as it were, ofblack ivory.  They also sell orphans and other defenceless ones of theirtribes, the usual rate of charge being about two or three yards ofcalico for a man, woman, or child.But the Arab slave-dealer sometimes finds it difficult to procure enoughof "cattle" in this way to make up a band sufficiently large to startwith for the coast because he is certain to lose four out of every five,at the _lowest estimate_, on his journey down.  The drove, therefore,must be large.  In order to provide it he sends out parties to buy wherethey can, and to steal when they have the chance.  Meanwhile he takes uphis quarters near some tribe, and sets about deliberately to producewar.  He rubs up old sores, foments existing quarrels, lends guns andammunition, suggests causes of dispute, and finally gets two tribes tofight.  Of course many are slaughtered, fearful barbarities and excessesare committed, fields are laid waste and villages are burnt, but this isa matter of no consequence to our Arab.  Prisoners are sure to be taken,and he buys the prisoners; for the rest,--there are plenty of natives inAfrica!When all else fails, not being very particular, he sends off a partyunder some thorough-going scoundrel, well-armed, and with instructionsto attack and capture wherever they go.No wonder, then, that the rumoured approach of Marizano and his mencaused the utmost alarm in Kambira's village, and that the women andchildren were ordered to fly to the bush without delay.  This theyrequired no second bidding to do, but, oh! it was a sad sight to seethem do it.  The younger women ran actively, carrying the infants andleading the smaller children by the hands, and soon disappeared; but itwas otherwise with the old people.  These, men and women, bowed withage, and tottering as much from terror as decrepitude, hobbled along,panting as they went, and stumbling over every trifling obstruction intheir path, being sometimes obliged to stop and rest, though death mightbe the consequence; and among these there were a few stray littlecreatures barely able to toddle, who had probably been forgotten orforsaken by their mothers in the panic, yet were of sufficient age to beaware, in their own feeble way, that danger of some sort was behindthem, and that safety lay before.  By degrees all--young and old, strongand feeble--gained the shelter of the bush, and Kambira was left with ahandful of resolute warriors to check the invaders and defend his home.Well was it at that time for Kambira and his men that the approachingband was _not_ Marizano and his robbers.When the head of the supposed enemy's column appeared on the brow of theadjacent hill, the Manganja chief fitted an arrow to his bow, and,retiring behind a hut, as also did his followers, resolved that Marizanoshould forfeit his life even though his own should be the penalty.  Verybitter were his thoughts, for his tribe had suffered from that villainat a former period, and he longed to rid the land of him.As he thought thus he looked at his followers with an expression ofdoubt for he knew too well that the Manganja were not a warlike tribe,and feared that the few who remained with him might forsake him in thehour of need.  Indeed, much of his own well-known courage was to beattributed to the fact, that his mother had belonged to a family more orless nearly connected with the Ajawa, who are very warlike--too much so,in truth, for it is they who, to a large extent are made use of by theslave-dealers to carry on war with the neighbouring tribes.  Kambira'smen, however, looked resolute, though very grave.While he was thus meditating vengeance, he observed that one of theapproaching band advanced alone without arms, and making signs of peace.This surprised him a little, but dreading treachery, he kept under theshelter of a hut until the stranger was close to the village; then,observing that the party on the hill had laid down their arms and seatedthemselves on the grass, he advanced, still, however, retaining hisweapons.The stranger was a little man, and appeared timid, but seeing that thechief evidently meant no mischief, and knowing that the guns of hisfriends had him within range, he drew near."Where come you from?" demanded Kambira.To this Antonio--for it was he--replied that his party came from thecoast; that they wanted to pass through the land to see it, and to findout what it produced and what its people had to sell; that it was led bytwo Englishmen, who belonged to a nation that detested slavery--the samenation that sent out Dr Livingstone, who, as everybody knew, had passedthrough that land some years before.  They were also, he said,countrymen of the men of God who had come out to teach the Manganja theTruth, who had helped them in their troubles, delivered them from theslave-traders, and some of whom had died in their land.  He added thatthere were Manganja men and women in their company.The "men of God" to whom Antonio referred, and to whom he had beenexpressly told by Harold Seadrift to refer, were those devotedmissionaries mentioned in a previous chapter, who, under the leadershipof the amiable and true-hearted Bishop Mackenzie, established a missionamong these very Manganja hills in the year 1861.  By a rare combinationof Christian love and manly courage under very peculiar circumstances,they acquired extraordinary power and influence over the natives in thespace of a few months, and laid the foundation of what might have been--perhaps may yet be--true Christianity in Central Africa.  But thecountry was unhappily involved at the time in one of the wars created bythe Portuguese and Arab slave-traders.  The region was almostdepopulated by man-stealers, and by the famine that resulted from theculture of the land having been neglected during the panic.  The goodbishop and several of his devoted band sank under the combined effectsof climate and anxiety, and died there, while the enfeebled remnant werecompelled, sorrowfully, to quit the field, to the deep regret of thesurviving Manganja.  [_The Story of the Universities' Mission to CentralAfrica_, by the Reverend Henry Rowley.--We can heartily recommend thisto the young--ay, and to the old--as being, next to the Adventures ofWilliams in the South Seas, one of the most interesting records ofmissionary enterprise that we ever read.]When, therefore, Antonio mentioned Bishop Mackenzie and Dr Livingstone,a gleam of intelligent interest lit up Kambira's swarthy countenance,and he was about to speak, but suddenly checked himself, and a sternfrown chased the gleam away."The Manganja," he said, after a few moments' silence, during which poorAntonio eyed him with some distrust, "know well that these men of Godwere not of the same country as the Arab and the Portuguese; that theyhated slavery and loved the Manganja, and that the graves of some ofthem are with us now; but we know also that some white men are greatliars.  How am I to make sure that your leaders are English?  Why didyou not bring down the Manganja men and women you say are with you?""The women were footsore, and fell behind with their men," answeredAntonio, "and we thought it best not to wait for them.""Go," rejoined Kambira, waving his hand; "if you be true men let theEnglishmen come to me, and also the Manganja, _without guns_, then Iwill believe you.--Go."The peremptory manner in which this was said left no room for reply.Antonio therefore returned to his friends, and the chief to his cover.On consultation and consideration it was agreed that Kambira's adviceshould be acted on, "For," said Disco, removing the pipe with which hehad been solacing himself during Antonio's absence, "we can plant ourfellers on the knoll here with a blunderbuss each, and arrange a signalso that, if there should be anything like foul play, we'd have nothin'to do but hold aloft a kercher or suthin o' that sort, an' they'd pour abroadside into 'em afore they could wink--d'ee see?""Not quite clearly," replied Harold, smiling, "because some of ourfellows can't take an aim at all, much less a good one, so they'd be aslikely to shoot us as them."Disco pondered this a little, and shook his head, then shook the ashesout of his pipe, and said that on the whole he was willing to risk it--that they "could not expect to travel through Afriky without riskingsummat."As Chimbolo with his wife and the rest of the party came up at thatmoment the case was put before him.  He at once advised compliance withKambira's request saying that the presence of himself and his friendswould be quite sufficient to put the chief's mind at rest.In a few minutes the plan was carried out and Kambira satisfied of thegood faith of his visitors.  Nevertheless he did not at once throw openhis arms to them.  He stood upon his dignity; asked them a good manyquestions, and answered a good many more, addressing himself always toAntonio as the spokesman, it being a point of etiquette not to addressthe principal of the party.  Then, presents were exchanged, in themanagement of which a considerable time was spent.  One of the warriorshaving in the meantime been despatched to recall the fugitives, thesebegan to pour out of the woods, the frail old people and forsakentoddlers being the last to return, as they had been the last to fly.After this, fires were kindled, fowls were chased, caught, slain,plucked, roasted, and boiled; hippopotamus-flesh was produced, thestrangers were invited to make themselves at home, which they very soondid.  Beer and bang were introduced; the celebrated fiddler wasreinstated, the dance, which had been so long delayed, was at lastfairly begun, and, as if to make the picture perfect and felicitycomplete, the moon came out from behind a thick cloud, and clothed thevalley with a flood of silver light.CHAPTER ELEVEN.REVEALS DISCO'S OPINIONS ABOUT SAVAGES, AND THE SAVAGES' OPINIONS OFDISCO, AND OTHER WEIGHTY MATTERS.As two or three of Harold's people were not very well just at that time,he resolved to remain at Kambira's village for a few days to give themrest, and afterwards to push on to the country of his friend Chimbolo.This arrangement he came to the more readily that he was short ofprovisions, and Kambira told him that a particular part of the countrynear the shores of a lake not far distant abounded with game of allsorts.To Disco Lillihammer he explained his plans next day, while that worthy,seated under the shade of a banyan-tree, was busily engaged with what hestyled his "mornin' dooties"--namely, the filling and smoking of hiscutty-pipe."You see, Disco," he said, "it won't do to knock up the men withcontinuous travel, therefore I shall give them a spell of rest here.Kambira tells me that there is plenty of game, large and small, to behad not far off, so that we shall be able to replenish our stock of meatand perchance give the niggers a feast such as they have not beenaccustomed to of late, for it is not too much to expect that our rifleswill do more execution, at all events among lions and elephants, thannative spears.  Besides, I wish to see something of the people, who,being what we may call pure out-and-out savages--""Savages!" interrupted Disco, removing his pipe, and pointing with thestem of it to the village on an eminence at the outskirts of which theywere seated; "d'ee call them folk savages?"Harold looked at the scene before him, and paused for a few moments; andwell he might, for not fifty yards off the blacksmith was plying hiswork energetically, while a lad sat literally _between_ a pair of nativebellows, one of which he blew with his left hand, the other with hisright and, beyond these, groups of men and women wrought at theirprimitive looms or tilled their vegetable gardens and patches of land."Savages!" repeated Disco, still pointing to the village with the stemof his pipe, and gazing earnestly at his companion, "humph!"It is probable that Disco might have said more, but he was an accuratejudge of the precise moment when a pipe is about to go out, and delaywill prove fatal.  He therefore applied himself diligently to suck andcherish the dying spark.  Having revived its powers to such an extentthat clouds enveloped his visage, and his nose, being red, loomedluridly through them, he removed the pipe, and again said, "Humph!  Theyain't a bit more savages, sir, than you or me is.""Perhaps not," replied Harold.  "To say truth, it would be difficult topoint out any peculiarity that justifies the name, except the fact thatthey wear very little clothing, and neither go to school nor church.""They wears no clothin'," rejoined Disco, "'cause they don't need for todo so; an' they don't go to church or school, 'cause they hain't gotnone to go to--that same bein' not the fault o' the niggers, but o' themas knows better.""There's truth in what you say, Disco," returned Harold, with a smile,"but come, you must admit that there is something savage in the customthey have of wearing these hideous lip-rings."The custom to which he referred is one which prevails among several ofthe tribes of Africa, and is indeed so utterly hideous and outrageousthat we should be justified in refusing to believe it, were we notassured of the fact by Dr Livingstone and other missionaries andtravellers of unquestionable integrity.  The ring is worn in the upperlip, not hanging from it but fitted into a hole in it in such a manneras to thrust the lip straight and far out from the face.  As the ring isabout the size of an ordinary napkin-ring, it may be easily believed,that time is required for the formation of the deformity.  At an earlyage the middle of the upper lip of a girl is pierced close to the nose,and a small pin introduced to prevent the hole closing up.  After it ishealed the pin is taken out and a larger one forced into its place, andso for weeks, months, and years the process of increasing the size ofthe lip goes on, until a ring of two inches in diameter can beintroduced.  Nearly all the women in these parts use this ring, or, asit is called, pelele.  Some make them of bamboo, others of ivory or tin.When a wearer of the pelele smiles, the action of the cheek musclesdraws the lip tight which has the effect of raising the ring towards theeyebrows, so that the nose is seen in the middle of it, and the teethare exposed, a revelation which shows that the latter have been chippedto sharp points so as to resemble the teeth of a cat or crocodile."No doubt," said Disco, in reply to Harold's remark, "the lip-rings areuncommon ugly, but the principle o' the thing, sir, that's w'ere it is,the principle ain't no wuss than ear-rings.  The savages, as we calls'em, bores holes in their lips an' sticks rings into 'em.  The civilisedfolk, as we calls ourselves, bores holes in their ears an' sticks ringsinto 'em.  W'ere's the difference? that's wot _I_ want to know.""There's not much difference in principle," said Harold, laughing, "butthere is a great difference in appearance.  Ear-rings hang gracefully;lip-rings stick out horribly.""H'm! it appears to me that that's a matter o' taste, now.  Howsoever, Ido admit that lip-rings is wuss than ear-rings; moreover it must makekissin' somewhat difficult, not to say onpleasant, but, as I saidbefore, so I says again, It's all in the principle w'ere it lies.  W'y,look here, sir,--savages, as we call 'em, wear brass rings round theirnecks, our women wear gold and brass chains.  The savages wear anklets,we wear bracelets.  They have no end o' rings on their toes, we have 'emon our fingers.  Some savages shave their heads, some of us shaves ourfaces.  Their women are raither given to clothin' which is too short andtoo narrer, ours come out in toggery far too wide, and so longsometimes, that a feller daren't come within a fathom of 'em astarnwithout runnin' the risk o' trampin' on, an' carrying away some o' thecanvas.  The savage women frizzes out their hair into most fantasticalshapes, till the very monkeys has to hold their sides sittin' in thetrees larfin' at 'em--and wot do _we_ do in regard to that?  W'y, someof _our_ women puts on a mixture o' hairy pads, an' combs, an' pins, an'ribbons, an' flowers, in a bundle about twice the size o' their heads,all jumbled together in such a way as to defy description; an' if themonkeys was to see _them_, they'd go off into such fits that they'dbu'st altogether an' the race would become extinct in Afriky.  No, sir;it's my opinion that there ain't no such thing as savages--or, if youchoose to put it the tother way, we're all savages together."Disco uttered the last part of his speech with intense energy, windingit up with the usual slap on the thigh, delivered with unusual fervour,and then, becoming aware that the vital spark of the cutty had all butfled, he applied himself to its resuscitation, in which occupation hefound relief to his feelings, and himself formed a brilliantillustration of his remarks on savage customs.Harold admitted that there was much truth in what he said, but ratherinclined to the opinion that of the two sets of savages the uncivilisedwere, if anything, the wildest.  Disco however, contrary to his usualhabits, had nailed his colours to the mast on that point and could nothaul them down.  Meanwhile Harold's opinion was to some extent justifiedby the appearance of a young man, who, issuing from the jungle close athand, advanced towards them.Most of the men at the village displayed a good deal of pride, if nottaste, in the arrangement of their hair.  Some wore it long and twistedinto a coil which hung down their backs; others trained and stiffened itin such a way that it took the form of buffalo horns, while some allowedit to hang over the shoulders in large masses, and many shaved it eitherentirely, or partially in definite patterns.  But the young dandy whonow approached outdid all others, for he had twisted his hair intoinnumerable little tails, which, being stiffened by fillets of the innerbark of a tree, stuck straight out and radiated from the head in alldirections.  His costume otherwise was simple enough, consisting merelyof a small kilt of white calico.  He was accompanied by Antonio."We've be come from Kambira," said the interpreter, "to tell you forcome to feast.""All right," said Disco, rising; "always ready for wittles if you onlygives us an hour or two between times.--I say, Tony," (he had by thattime reduced the interpreter's name to this extent), "ask this fellerwhat he means by makin' sitch a guy of hisself.""Hims say it look well," said Antonio, with a broad grin."Looks well--eh? and ask him why the women wear that abominable pelele."When this question was put to the black dandy, he looked at Discoevidently in surprise at his stupidity.  "Because it is the fashion," hesaid."They wear it for beauty, to be sure!  Men have beards and whiskers;women have none, and what kind of creature would woman be withoutwhiskers, and without a pelele?  She would have a mouth like a man, andno beard!"The bare idea of such a state of things tickled the dandy so much thathe went into roars of laughter, insomuch that all the radiating tails ofhis head quivered again.  The effect of laughter and tails together wasirresistible.  Harold, Disco, and Antonio laughed in sympathy, till thetears ran down their cheeks, and then returned to the village whereKambira and his chief men awaited them.While enjoying the feast prepared for them, Harold communicated hisintentions and desires to the chief, who was delighted at the prospectof having such powerful allies on a hunting expedition.The playful Obo meanwhile was clambering over his father's person like ablack monkey.  He appeared to be particularly fond of his father, and aslove begets love, it is not surprising that Kambira was excessively fondof Obo.  But Obo, becoming obstreperous, received an amicable punch fromhis father, which sent him headlong into a basket of boiledhippopotamus.  He gave a wild howl of alarm as Disco snatched him out ofthe dish, dripping with fat, and set him on his knee."There, there, don't blubber," said the seaman, tenderly wiping off thefat while the natives, including Kambira, exploded with laughter.  "Youain't burnt, are you?"As Obo could not reply, Disco put his finger into the gravy from whichthe urchin had been rescued, and satisfied himself that it was not hotenough to have done the child injury.  This was also rendered apparentby his suddenly ceasing to cry, struggling off Disco's knee, andrenewing his assaults on his easy-going father.Accepting an egg which was offered him by Yohama, Harold broke it, andentered into conversation with Kambira through the medium of Antonio."Is your boy's mother a--Hollo! there's a chick in this egg," heexclaimed, throwing the offensive morsel into the fire.Jumbo, who sat near the place where it fell, snatched it up, grinned,and putting it into his cavernous mouth, swallowed it."Dem's betterer wid chickies," he said, resuming his gravity and hisknife and fingers,--forks being held by him in light esteem."Ask him, Antonio, if Obo's mother is alive," said Harold, tryinganother egg, which proved to be in better condition.The interpreter, instead of putting the question without comment, as washis wont, shook his head, looked mysterious, and whispered--"No betterask dat.  Hims lost him's wife.  The slave-hunters cotch her some timeago, and carry her off when hims away hunting.  Hims awful mad, worserdan mad elerphint when hims speak to 'bout her."Harold of course dropped the subject at once, after remarking that hesupposed Yohama was the child's grandmother."Yis," said Antonio; "she be Kambira's moder, an' Obo's gran'moder--bofat once."This fact was, we may almost say, self-evident for Obo's attentions andfavours were distributed exclusively between Yohama and Kambira, thoughthe latter had unquestionably the larger share.During the course of the feast, beer was served round by the little manwho had performed so deftly on the violin the previous evening."Drink," said Kambira hospitably; "I am glad to see my white brothershere; drink, it will warm your hearts.""Ay, an' it won't make us drunk," said Disco, destroying Jumbo's peaceof mind by winking and making a face at him as he raised the calabash tohis lips.  "Here's long life to you, Kambira, an' death to slavery."There can be no doubt that the chief and his retainers would haveheartily applauded that sentiment if they had understood it, but at themoment Antonio was too deeply engaged with another calabash to take thetrouble to translate it.The beer, which was pink, and as thick as gruel, was indeed too weak toproduce intoxication unless taken in very large quantities; neverthelessmany of the men were so fond of it that they sometimes succeeded intaking enough to bring them to the condition which we style "fuddled."But at that time the particular brew was nearly exhausted, so thattemperance was happily the order of the day.Having no hops in those regions, they are unable to preventfermentation, and are therefore obliged to drink up a whole brewing asquickly as possible after it is made."Man, why don't ye wash yer face?" said Disco to the little fiddler ashe replenished his calabash; "it's awful dirty."Jumbo laughed, of course, and the small musician, not understanding whatwas said, followed suit out of sympathy."Wash him's face!" cried Antonio, laughing, "him would as soon cut offhim's head.  Manganja nevair wash.  Ah me!  You laugh if you hear dewomans ask me yesterday--`Why you wash?' dey say, `our men nevair do.'Ho! ho! dey looks like it too.""I'm sure that cannot be said of Kambira or any of his chief men," saidHarold."Perhaps not," retorted Antonio, "but some of 'um nevair wash.  Once'pon a time one man of dis tribe foller a party me was with.  Not go wayfor all we tell 'um.  We said we shoot 'um.  No matter, hims follerstill.  At last we say, `You scoun'rel, we _wash_ you!'  Ho! how himsrun!  Jist like zebra wid lion at 'um's tail.  Nevair see 'um afterdat--nevair more!""Wot a most monstrous ugly feller that is sittin' opposite Kambira, onthe other side o' the fire--the feller with the half-shaved head," saidDisco in an undertone to Harold during a temporary pause in eating."A well-made man, however," replied Harold.--"I say, Disco," he added,with a peculiar smile, "you think yourself rather a good-looking fellow,don't you, now?"The worthy seaman, who was indeed an exceptionally good-looking tar,modestly replied--"Well now, as you have put it so plump I don't mind ifI do confess that I've had some wild suspicions o' that sort now andthen.""Then you may dismiss your suspicions now, for I can assure you that youare regarded in this land as a very monster of ugliness," said Harold,laughing."In the estimation of niggers your garments are hideous; your legs theythink elephantine, your red beard frightful, and your blue eyessavage--_savage_! think of that.""Well, well," retorted Disco, "your own eyes are as blue as mine, an' Idon't suppose the niggers think more of a yaller beard than a red one.""Too true, Disco; we are both ill-favoured fellows here, whatever we maybe elsewhere; however, as we don't intend to take Manganja wives itwon't matter much.  But what think you of our plan, now that Kambira isready to fall in with it?""It seems a good one.  When do we start?""To-morrow," said Harold."Wery good," replied Disco, "I'm agreeable."The morrow came, and with the early light all the people turned out towitness the departure of the hunters.  Scouts had been previously sentout in all directions to make sure that no enemies or slave-traders wereat that time in their immediate neighbourhood, and a strong force of thebest warriors was left to guard the village.Of Harold's band, two half-castes, Jose and Oliveira, volunteered tostay in camp with the guard, and two, Songolo and Mabruki, the freemenof Quillimane, remained in the village to recruit their health, whichhad failed.  Chimbolo likewise remained, the wounds on his back nothaving healed sufficiently to admit of the hard labour of hunting.  Allthe rest accompanied the hunters, and of these the three Makololo men,Jumbo, Zombo, and Masiko, were incomparably the best and bravest.  Ofcourse the volatile Antonio also went, being indispensable.On setting out--each man with his sleeping-mat on his back and hislittle wooden pillow hung at his neck,--there was a great deal ofshouting and ho-ho-ing and well-wishing on the part of those whoremained behind, but above all the noise there arose a shrill cry ofintense and agonising despair.  This proceeded from the small windpipeof little Obo, who had not until the last moment made the appallingdiscovery that Kambira was going away without him!There was something very touching in the cry of the urchin, andsomething which brought vividly to the minds of the Englishmen theinfantine community of their own land.  There was the same sudden gazeof horror on realising the true position of affairs,--the same sharpshriek and frantic struggle to escape from the grasp of those who heldhim back from following his father,--the same loud cry of agony onfinding that his efforts were vain, and then, the wide-open mouth, theclose-shut eyes, and the awful, prolonged silence--suggestive of fits--that betokens the concentration of mind, heart, and lungs into thattremendous roar of unutterable significance which appears to be thesafety-valve of the human family, black and white, at that tender periodof life.Poor Obo! his sobs continued to burst out with steam-engine power, andhis eyes to pour cataracts of tears into Yohama's sympathetic bosom,long after the hunting party had left the hills behind them, andadvanced into the almost impenetrable jungles of the low grounds.CHAPTER TWELVE.DESCRIBES A HUNTING EXPEDITION WHICH WAS BOTH EXCITING AND SUCCESSFUL.Down by the reedy margin of a pretty large lake--where wild-fowlinnumerable made the air vocal with their cries by day, and frogs, innumbers inconceivable, chirped and croaked a lullaby to men who slept,and a symphony to beasts that howled and growled and prowled at night inbush and brake--Kambira pitched his camp.He did not indeed, select the moist level of the fever-breeding marshes,but he chose for his temporary habitation the dry summit of a woodedhill which overlooked the lake.Here the natives of the neighbourhood said that elephants had beenlately seen, and buffaloes, zebras, etcetera, were at all timesnumerous.After two long days' march they had reached the spot, and encamped latein the evening.  Next morning early the business of the expeditionbegan.  Various parties of natives, armed with bows and arrows andspears, were sent out in different directions, but the principal bandwas composed of Kambira and his chief men, with Harold and his party.They did not go far before game was found.  Guinea-fowl were numerous,and those who were aimed with bows soon procured a goodly supply ofthese, but our travellers did not waste their energies or powder on suchsmall game.  Besides these, monkeys peeped inquisitively at the huntersfrom among the trees, and myriads of turtle-doves were seen in thecovers.  As they advanced, wild pigs, elands, waterbucks, koodoos, andother creatures, were seen in herds, and the natives dropped off, orturned aside in pursuit of these, so that ere long the band remainingwith Kambira was reduced to about forty men.Coming to a small river in which were a number of deep pools andshallows, they saw several hippopotami lying asleep, their bodies nearlyall out of the water, appearing like masses of black rock in the stream.But at the same place they discovered fresh traces of elephants andbuffaloes, therefore the hippopotami were left unmolested, save thatHarold sent a bullet amongst them, partly to let the natives hear thereport of his gun, and partly to see how the animals would take it.They all started to their feet at once, and stared around them withlooks of stolid surprise that were almost equal to the looks of thenatives, to whom fire-arms were little known, except by report.  Anothershot sent the whole herd with a heavy plunge into deep water."It's a queer country," observed Disco when they had resumed theirmarch.  "Just look at them there lizards with red and blue tails runningabout among the rocks an' eatin' up the white ants like one o'clock."Disco might have said like twelve o'clock, if numbers would have addedto the force of his remark, for the little creatures referred to weremiraculously active in pursuit of their food."But I s'pose," continued Disco, "the niggers would think our country aqueerer place than this.""Undoubtedly they would," replied Harold; "just fancy what would be thefeelings of Kambira if he were suddenly transported into the heart ofLondon.""Hallo!" exclaimed Disco, stopping suddenly and pointing to one of themen in advance, who had crouched and made signals to his friends tohalt, "breakers ahead--eh?""More likely buffaloes," whispered Harold, as he cocked his rifle andadvanced quickly with Kambira, who carried a short spear or javelin.On reaching an opening in the bushes, a small herd of zebras wasobserved not much more than a hundred yards in advance."Will the white man's gun kill so far?" asked the chief, turning toAntonio.The interpreter made no reply, but pointed to Harold, who was in the actof taking aim.  The loud report was followed by the fall of the nearestzebra.  Disco also fired and wounded another, which bounded away in wildalarm with its fellows.The natives yelled with delight, and Disco cheered in sympathy."You've hit him," said Harold, as he reloaded."Ay, but I han't disabled him.  Better luck next time.  I think I tookhim somewhere on the port bow.""If by that you mean the left shoulder," returned Harold, with a laugh,"it's likely he won't run far.  What does Kambira think of the whiteman's gun?" he added, turning round.The tall chief nodded approvingly, and said, with a gravecountenance--"Good, good; it is good--better than this," shaking hisshort spear.At that moment a small antelope, which had been startled and put toflight by some of the other bands of hunters, came crashing wildlytowards them, ignorant of the enemy in its front until within aboutthirty yards.  It turned at a sharp angle and plunged into the jungle,but the spear which Kambira had shaken whizzed though the air andpierced its heart before it had time to disappear."A splendid heave!" cried Disco, with enthusiasm; "why, man alive, you'dmake yer fortin' as a harpooner if ye was to go to the whale-fishin'.--Hallo! there's somethin' else; w'y, the place is swarmin'.  It's for allthe world like a zoological ga'rdings let loose."As he spoke, the hoofs of a herd of ponderous animals were heard, butthe rank grass and underwood concealed them entirely from view.  Thewhole party rushed to the nearest opening, and were just in time to seethe tail of an irate buffalo make a magnificent flourish in the air asits owner plunged into cover.There was no further attempt at conversation after this.  The nearpresence of large game was too exciting, so that merely a word ofadvice, direction, or inquiry, passed as the party advanced rapidly--oneor two of the most active going before as pioneers.While Disco was striding along with flashing eyes, rifle ready, and headturning from side to side in momentary expectation of something boundingsuddenly out of somewhere, he chanced to cast his eyes upwards, and, tohis horror, beheld two huge serpents coiled together among the branchesof a tree close to his head.Uttering a yell of alarm--for he entertained an almost superstitiousdread of serpents--he fired blindly upwards, and dashed to one side soviolently that he tumbled himself and Harold into a bush of wait-a-bitthorns, out of which the laughing natives found it difficult to extractthem."What _is_ the matter, man?" said Harold somewhat testily."Have a care! look!  Avast!  A bite'll be death, an' no mistake!" criedDisco, pointing to the reptiles.Harold fired at once and brought them both down, and the natives,attacking them with sticks, soon killed them."No fear," said Antonio, with a chuckle.  "Dem not harm nobody, thoughums ugly an' big enough."This was true.  They were a couple of pythons, and the larger of thetwo, a female, was ten feet long; but the python is a harmless creature.While they were talking, smoke was observed to rise from an isolatedclump of long grass and bushes not far from the banks of the river, muchto the annoyance of Kambira, who feared that the fire might spread andscare away the game.  It was confined, however, to the place where itbegan, but it had the effect of driving out a solitary buffalo that hadtaken refuge in the cover.  Jumbo chanced to be most directly in frontof the infuriated animal when it burst out, and to him exclusively itdirected its attentions.Never since Jumbo was the size of Obo had that laughter-loving savageused his lithe legs with greater energy than on this occasion.  Anostrich might have envied him as he rushed towards the river, into whichhe sprang headlong when the buffalo was barely six feet behind him.Of course Harold fired, as well as Disco, and both shots told, as also aspear from Kambira, nevertheless the animal turned abruptly on seeingJumbo disappear, and charged furiously up the bank, scattering itsenemies right and left.  Harold fired again at little more than fiftyyards off, and heard the bullet thud as it went in just behind theshoulder, yet strange to say, it seemed to have no other effect than torouse the brute to greater wrath, and two more bullets failed to bringhim down.This toughness of the buffalo is by no means uncommon, but differentanimals vary much in their tenacity of life.  Some fall at once to thefirst well-directed shot; others die hard.  The animal the hunters werenow in pursuit of, or rather which was in pursuit of the hunters, seemedto be of the latter class.  Harold fired another shot from behind atree, having loaded with a shell-bullet, which exploded on hitting thecreature's ribs.  It fell, much to the satisfaction of Disco, of whom ithappened to be in pursuit at the time.  The seaman at once stopped andbegan to reload, and the natives came running forward, when Antonio, whohad climbed a tree to be out of harm's way, slipped down and ran withgreat bravery up to the prostrate animal.Just as he reached it the buffalo sprang up with the activity of a cat,and charged him.  Antonio turned and ran with such rapidity that hislittle legs became almost invisible, like those of a sparrow in a hurry.He gained a tree, and had just time to climb into it when the buffalostruck it like a battering-ram, hard enough almost to have split bothhead and tree.  It paused a few seconds, drew back several paces, glaredsavagely at Antonio, and then charged again and again, as if resolvedeither to shake him out of the tree, or give itself a splittingheadache, but another shell from Harold, who could hardly take aim forlaughing, stretched the huge animal dead upon the ground.  Altogether,it took two shells and five large solid rifle-balls to finish him."That wos a pretty good spurt," said Disco, panting, as he joined Haroldbeside the fallen beast.  "It's well-known that a starn chase is a long'un, but this would have been an exception to the rule if you hadn'tshot him, sir.  He pretty nigh made short work o' _me_.  He was a'mostaboard of me w'en you fired.""True," said Harold; "and had that tree not grown where it stands, andgrown tough, too, I suspect he would have made short work of Antoniotoo.""Bah!" said the interpreter, with affected carelessness, "him was but aslow brute, after all."Disco looked at Jumbo, who was none the worse of his ducking, and shuthis right eye smartly.  Jumbo opened his cavernous mouth, and explodedso violently that his double row of brilliant teeth must have been blownout and scattered on the ground, had they not been miraculously strong."Come, now," said Kambira, who had just given orders to some of hisfollowers to remain behind and look after the carcase, "we go to findelephants.""Have we much chance of findin' them?" inquired Disco.Kambira thought they had, because fresh traces had been recently seen inthe neighbourhood, whereupon Disco said that he would prefer to go afterlions, but Kambira assured him that these animals were not so easy tofind, and much more dangerous when attacked.  Admitting the force ofthis, though still asserting his preference of lions to elephants, thebloodthirsty son of Neptune shouldered his rifle and followed hisleader.While the main party of hunters were thus successfully pushing along,the other bands were not idle, though, possessing no fire-arms, theywere less noisy.  In fact their proceedings were altogether of thecat-catty.  One fellow, as black as a coal, as lithe as an eel, and aslong--according to Disco's standard--as a fathom of pump-water, havingcome upon a herd of buffalo unseen by them, and being armed with a smallbow and quiver of arrows, suddenly dropped on all-fours and began toglide through the long grass.Now there is a particular little bird in those regions which calls forspecial notice here.  It is a very singular bird, inasmuch as it hasconstituted itself the guardian of the buffalo.  It frequently sits uponthat animal's back, and, whenever it sees the approach of man, or anyother danger, it flaps its wings and screams to such an extent, that thebuffalo rushes off without waiting to inquire or see what is the matter;and the small guardian seems to think itself sufficiently rewarded withthe pickings it finds on the back of its fat friend.  So vigilant isthis little creature, that it actually renders the approach of thehunter a matter of great difficulty in circumstances when, but for it,he might approach with ease.  [See Livingstone's _Zambesi and itsTributaries_, page 200.]Our wary native was, however, aware of this little fellow'spropensities, and took precautions to outwit the bird rather than thebeast.  It may perhaps cause some surprise to be told that a small bowand arrows were a sufficiently powerful species of artillery to bring tobear against such noble game, but the surprise will vanish when we statethat the arrows were poisoned.Having crawled to within range, the fathom of black pump-water suddenlyarose and let fly an arrow.  The missile went deep into the side of amajestic bull.  The little bird fluttered and screamed too late.  Thebull at once dashed away at full speed, starting off the whole herd inalarm.  The black fathom followed at the top of his speed, and wasjoined by a number of other black fathoms, who were quite aware of whathad been done.  The buffaloes were soon out of sight, but the fathomsfollowed the trail with the unerring pertinacity of fate.  After a longrun they came up with the stricken bull, which had fallen behind itsfellows, and waited patiently until the poison took full effect.  In ashort time the animal fell, and the successful hunters fell to work uponhis carcase with their knives.Leaving them thus employed, we will return to Kambira and his friends.They had not gone far when a fine water-buck was observed feeding besidea creek.Kambira laid his hand on Harold's shoulder and pointed to it with asmile, which might have been interpreted, "Now, then, there's a chancefor you!"Harold fired, and the water-buck dropped."Good," said Kambira."Hallo!" exclaimed Disco.And well he might, for at that moment an enormous crocodile, which hadevidently been watching the water-buck, seized and dragged it into thewater.  It was not deep, however, and the wounded animal made adesperate plunge, hauled the crocodile several yards, and tore itselfout of its hideous jaws.  It then jumped into the stream and wasswimming across when another crocodile made a dash at it, but Haroldsent a ball into its ugly head, which appeared to make it change itsmind.  It disappeared, and the water-buck turning, made for the bankfrom which it had started.  Just as it reached it the vital spark fled--the fine head dropped and the body turned over.It will be seen from what has been told, that on this occasion therifles did most of the work.  The natives who followed Harold hadnothing to do but look on exultingly, glare, dance, show their teeth andgums, and secure the game.  We cannot perhaps, expect the good-naturedreader to follow us through all the details of that day's work; but itwould be unpardonable were we to close the chapter without referring tothe principal event of the day, which occurred a couple of hours afterthe shooting of the water-buck.It happened thus:--When the hunters began to grow tired, and theprospect of falling in with large game became less hopeful, the chiefdetermined to return to camp; but Disco felt so disappointed at nothaving seen an elephant or a lion, that he expressed a wish to continuethe chase with a small select party.  Harold laughed at the idea of theseaman leading such a party, but offered no objection, although he didnot care to accompany his friend, having, as he said, had enough of it,and being desirous of having a long chat with the chief in camp."You see, sir," said Disco, patting the stock of his rifle with hisright hand, "we chance to have got, so to speak, into the heart of ashoal o' big fish, an' there's no sayin' how soon they may take it intotheir heads to up anchor, and make sail for other grounds.  Therefore,says I, blaze away at 'em while you've got the chance.""But you may have as good a chance to-morrow, or next day," suggestedHarold."We ain't sure o' that sir.  To-morrow, they say, never comes," returnedDisco.  "It's my ambition to let fly a broadside at a lion or a elephantso I means for to go on; an' wot I says is, Who wolunteers to sail incompany?"When the party were given to understand what "wolunteers" meant, thethree Makololo joined the tar with alacrity, also the Somali negroesNakoda and Conda, and about a dozen of the natives, armed with spears.Disco's own men were armed with their guns.  Antonio, being necessary toHarold, returned to camp; but this was a matter of little importance, asJumbo and his fellow-countrymen knew enough of English to act asinterpreters.Every one who has had a few years' experience of life knows the truth ofthe proverb which asserts that "fortune favours the brave."  Its truthwas exemplified on the present occasion not more than an hour after thelittle band of heroes had set out.Disco led the way, as a matter of course, holding, as he said, that nonigger could possibly be equal to a white sailor in the matter ofsteering, whether ashore or afloat.  He steered by the sun, and directedhis course to nowhere in particular, being influenced chiefly by theform of the ground and the appearance of the jungle.Jumbo grinned a good deal at the sententious gravity with which theleader delivered his orders, and the self-important strides with whichhe passed over the land.  He would have grinned still more, perhaps havelaughed outright if he had understood that the occasional off-hand kickswhich Disco bestowed on a thick bush here and there, were given in thehope that a lion might thereby be set up, as one dislodges a rabbit or ahare!At last on reaching the crest of a mound which was comparatively free ofunderwood, Disco beheld a sight which caused him to drop on his handsand knees as though he had been shot.Not more than fifty yards off a herd of cow elephants and their calveswere seen feeding quietly on tall heavy-seeded grass in the plain below."Avast!" said Disco, in a hoarse whisper, at the same time crouchingbehind a bush, and making frantic signals to the rest of the party toadvance with extreme caution."Wat 'um see?" inquired Jumbo in a low whisper, creeping up to hisexcited leader.There was no need for a reply.  A glance over the top of the bushsufficed."Be quiet as mice now, lads," said Disco, when all the members of hisparty had crept around him, and become aware of the presence ofelephants.  "Get your guns laid, and if any one of you dares to pull atrigger till I give the word, I'll keel-haul him."This, or something distantly resembling it, having been explained to themen who carried guns, they lay down and took aim.The noise made by the hunters attracted the attention of the nearestelephant, and, with true motherly instinct she placed her young onebetween her fore-legs for protection."We fire right in de middel ob de lot?" inquired Zombo hastily."Not at all," whispered Disco; "let every man point at the nearest one--the one that lays broadside on to us, wi' the little un under her bows.Now--ready--present--fire!"Bang went the seven guns with a degree of precision that might have putto shame any corps of volunteer riflemen in England; up went the trunksand tails of the elephants, little and big, and away rushed the wholeherd in dire alarm.  But the wounded animal suddenly stumbled and fellon its knees, then leaped up and ran on heavily.Meanwhile Disco, who had discharged only one barrel of his heavy gun,leaped over the bushes, and rushed forward at a pace which for a fewseconds enabled him to keep ahead even of the fleet natives.  Theelephants, however, easily left them all behind, and it appeared as ifthe affair were about to end in disappointment, when the wounded beastagain stumbled."Hold on! halt!" cried Disco in a voice of thunder.He kneeled at the same time, took aim, and fired.Whether it was this last shot or the effects of previous loss of blood,we cannot tell; but after receiving it, the ponderous animal rolled overon its side, and died.To say that the natives became temporarily insane would give but afeeble idea of what now took place, because few readers are likely to beaware of the amazing power of the negro to give expression to thevagaries of insanity.  We shall therefore content ourselves by sayingthat they cheered, laughed, howled, shouted, danced, and yelled--andleave the rest to imagination."Now, then, boys, avast howlin'.  Clap a stopper on your bellows, will'ee?" said Disco, in a boatswain's roar, that effectually quelled thetumult.  "Cut off to camp, every mother's son of you, an bring upKambira an' all the boys, with as many knives and dishes as ye canmuster, for this mountain of flesh ain't to be cut up in a hurry, an'the sun won't be long o' goin' to bed.  Away with 'ee!  Let's see howyou can wag yer black legs, an' I'll keep watch over the carcase.  Ifanything comes to have a look at it--a lion, for instance,--so much theworse for the lion!"It was in vain that Jumbo explained there was no necessity for sendingmore than one of the party to the camp.  Disco was a strictdisciplinarian, and, having given the order, enforced it in a mannerwhich admitted of no disobedience.  They therefore departed, leaving theseaman seated on the elephant, smoking his pipe with his gun beside him.But Jumbo did not go far.  He soon turned aside from his companions, andreturned to the scene of the hunt, resolved if possible to give hisleader a fright.  Gaining the skirts of the jungle which surrounded theopen space where Disco kept watch, he crept cautiously as near to him aspossible.Disco still sat smoking and eyeing the elephant with a smile ofsatisfaction.  Presently he rose,--retreated a few yards from thecarcase, and stood admiring it with his head on one side, as if it werea picture and he a connoisseur.  He had in this act approached somewhatnearer to Jumbo, who saluted him with a most awful growl.No monkey in Africa could have dropped its pipe, had it been a smoker,or sprung to seize its gun, had it been a sportsman, with greateragility than did Disco Lillihammer on that trying occasion!  Getting onthe other side of the dead elephant he faced round, cocked both barrels,and prepared to receive whatever might come.Jumbo, lying very low behind a bank of earth for safety, gave anotherlow growl.  Disco started and half raised his piece.  Jumbo then threw alarge stone towards a neighbouring bush, which it struck and caused torustle.This was enough for Disco, who took a quick aim, and let fly thecontents of both barrels into the bush.Jumbo noiselessly but swiftly crept back into the woods, chuckling as hewent, leaving Disco to reload in wild haste.  But his haste was uncalledfor.  There was no more growling; no more rustling in the bushes."I've done for him," muttered Disco, after waiting patiently at the"ready" for some time.  "But it won't do for me to ventur' up to it allby myself.  Pr'aps it's a lion, an' they do say that it's chancy work togo near a wounded lion.  To be sure the growl wasn't so loud as I'd haveexpected o' the king o' the forest, but then they don't always growlloud.  Anyhow I'll keep a bright look-out an' wait till the niggersreturn."Philosophising thus, the bold seaman mounted guard over the elephant.Meanwhile Jumbo, having got out of earshot of his friend, indulged in aloud laugh and made after his friends, but, observing the visage of asmall yellow-coloured monkey among the leaves overhead, a thoughtflashed into his mind and induced him to change his plans.Throwing his spear dexterously he transfixed the monkey and brought itdown.  Returning with great caution to the bush into which Disco hadfired, and gliding with the noiseless motion of a snake the latter partof the way, he placed the dead monkey on the ground and left it there.It was by that time too late to overtake his comrades.  He thereforewaited until they returned, and then joined the party in rear, as thoughhe had followed them from the camp.The same wild exhibition of delight was about to be enacted when theparty came trooping up, but Disco quickly checked it by the astoundingannouncement that he thought he had shot a lion, or somethin' o' thatsort!"You don't mean it!" said Harold, rather excited."All I know is," said Disco, "that I heerd somethin' uncommon like alion growl twice in yonder bush, an' saw the bush move too, so I fired abroadside that seemed to finish him at once, for there was no morerustlin' after that.""An' no more growlin'?" asked Jumbo, with much simplicity ofcountenance."Not a growl, nor nothin' else," answered Disco."Well, get your guns ready, lads," said Harold, "and stand by to firewhile we go and search the bush."So saying, Harold and Disco advanced together with their rifles ready,while the natives, who were more or less alarmed, according to theirrespective degrees of courage, scattered in a semicircle well in rear.Kambira, armed with a spear, kept close to Harold, and Jumbo, withunwonted bravery, walked alongside of Disco.  Antonio, quietly retiring,took refuge in a tree."Yoo's _sure_ you hit um?" inquired Jumbo in a whisper."Can't say I'm _sure_," replied Disco, "but we'll soon see.""Was um's growl very bad?" asked Jumbo."Hold yer long tongue!" said Disco testily, for he was becoming excited."Look! see dere!" exclaimed Jumbo in an energetic whisper."What? where?""Look! right troo de bush.  Dis way.  Dar, don' you zee um's skin,--t'other side?  Fire!""Why, eh!" exclaimed Disco, peering keenly through the leaves, "yellowhair! yes--its--"Stopping abruptly he pointed his gun at the bush and poured the contentsof both barrels into it.  Then, clubbing his weapon and brandishing itin the air, he uttered a wild cry--went crashing through the bush, andnext moment stood aghast before the yellow monkey, whose little carcasehe had almost blown to atoms.We won't chronicle the roars of laughter, the yells of delight thatfollowed,--the immense amount of chaffing, the innumerable witticismsand criticisms that ensued--no, no! regard for the gallant seamanconstrains us to draw a veil over the scene and leave it, as we haveleft many things before, and shall leave many things yet to come, to thereader's vivid imagination.Fortunately for Disco, the superior attractions of the dead elephantsoon drew off attention from this exploit.  The natives proceeded to cutup the huge mass of meat, and this was indeed an amazing spectacle.  Atfirst the men stood round the carcase in dead silence, while Kambiradelivered a species of oration, in which he pointed out minutely theparticular parts of the animal which were to be apportioned to thehead-men of the different fires of which the camp was composed,--theleft hind-leg and the parts around the eyes being allotted to hisEnglish visitors.  These points settled, the order was given to "cutup," and immediately the excitement which had been restrained burstforth again with tenfold violence.  The natives seemed to be quiteunable to restrain their feelings of delight, as they cut away at thecarcase with spears and knives.  They screamed as well as danced withglee.  Some attacked the head, others the flanks, jumping over theanimal or standing on it the better to expedite their operations; someever and anon ran off screaming with masses of bloody meat, threw it onthe grass and went back for more, while others, after cutting thecarcase open, jumped inside and wallowed about in their eagerness toreach and cut out the precious fat--all talking and shouting at theutmost pitch of their voices."Well, now," said Disco to Harold, with a grin of amusement, "the likeso' that I never did see nowheres.  Cuttin' up a Greenland whale isnothin' to it.""Come, come," said Harold, checking his laughter and seizing an excitednegro by the shoulder, "no fighting allowed."This had reference to two who chanced to have taken a fancy for the samemass of meat, and were quarrelling so violently over it that blowsseemed on the point of following, but having let off part of theirsuperabundant energy in words, they rushed back to expend the remainderon their dead friend.Suddenly a sharp agonised yell was heard inside the carcase.  Nextmoment Zombo jumped out all bloody and furious, holding up his righthand.  While groping about inside, one of his too eager comrades outsidehad laid about rather incautiously with his knife, drove it through themeat and sliced Zombo's left hand.  He was easily soothed, however;Harold bound up the cut with a piece of rag, and Zombo went to work asrecklessly as ever.In a marvellously short time tons of meat were cut up and dividedamongst the band, and, before daylight had quite disappeared, thehunters were on their way back to camp, while a troop of hyenas andother carnivora were gorging themselves with the elephant's remains.CHAPTER THIRTEEN.THE ENCAMPMENT AND THE SUPPER--DISCUSSIONS, POLITICAL AND OTHERWISE--KAMBIRA RECEIVES A SHOCK, AND OUR WANDERERS ARE THROWN INTO PERPLEXITY.Turn we now to a more peaceful scene.  The camp is almost quiet, thestars are twinkling brightly overhead, the fires are glimmering fitfullybelow.  The natives, having taken the edge off their appetites, havestretched their dusky forms on their sleeping-mats, and laid theirwoolly heads on their little wooden pillows.  The only persons movingare Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer--the first being busy makingnotes in a small book, the second being equally busy in manufacturingcloudlets from his unfailing pipe, gazing the while with much interestat his note-making companion."They was pretty vigorous w'en they wos at it, sir," said Disco, inreference to supper, observing that his companion looked up from hisbook, "but they wos sooner done than I had expected.""Yes, they weren't long about it," replied Harold, with an abstractedair, as he resumed his writing.Lest the reader should erroneously imagine that supper is over, it isnecessary here to explain what taking the edge off a free African'sappetite means.On reaching camp after the cutting up of the elephant, as detailed inthe last chapter, the negroes had set to work to roast and boil with adegree of vigour that would have surprised even the _chefs de cuisine_of the world's first-class hotels.  Having gorged themselves to anextent that civilised people might perhaps have thought dangerous, theyhad then commenced an uproarious dance, accompanied by stentorian songs,which soon reduced them to the condition of beings who needed repose.Proceeding upon the principle of overcoming temptation by giving way toit, they at once lay down and went to sleep.It was during this stage of the night's proceedings that Disco foolishlyimagined that supper had come to a close.  Not many minutes after theobservation was made, and before the black cutty-pipe was smoked out,first one and then another of the sleepers awoke, and, after a yawn ortwo, got up to rouse the fires and put on the cooking-pots.  In lessthan a quarter of an hour the whole camp was astir, conversation wasrife, and the bubbling of pots that had not got time to cool, and thehissing of roasts whose fat had not yet hardened, mingled with songswhose echoes were still floating in the brains of the wild inhabitantsof the surrounding jungle.  Roasting, boiling, and eating wererecommenced with as much energy as if the feast had only just begun.Kambira, having roused himself, gave orders to one of his men, whobrought one of the elephant's feet and set about the cooking of it atHarold's fire.  Kambira and Disco, with Antonio and Jumbo, sat round thesame fire.There was a hole in the ground close beside them which contained a smallfire; the embers of this were stirred up and replenished with fuel.When the inside was thoroughly heated, the elephant's foot was placed init, and covered over with hot ashes and soil, and another fire kindledabove the whole.Harold, who regarded this proceeding with some surprise, said toKambira--through Antonio--"Who are you cooking that for?""For my white guests," replied the chief."But we have supped already," said Harold; "we have already eaten asmuch as we can hold of the elephant's trunk and tongue, both of whichwere excellent--why prepare more?""This is not for to-night, but for to-morrow," returned Kambira, with asmile.  "The foot takes all night to cook."This was a sufficient explanation, and in truth the nature of the dishrequired that it should be well done.  When, on the morrow, they werecalled to partake of it they found that it was, according to Disco'sestimation, "fust-rate!"  It was a whitish mass, slightly gelatinous andsweet, like marrow, and very palatable.  Nevertheless, they learned fromexperience that if the effect of bile were to be avoided, a long marchwas necessary after a meal of elephant's foot!Meanwhile the proceedings of the natives were food enough for ourtravellers for the time being.  Like human creatures elsewhere, theydisplayed great variety of taste.  Some preferred boiled meat, othersroast; a few indulged in porridge made of mapira meal.  The meal wasvery good, but the porridge _was_ doubtful, owing to the cookery.  Itwould appear that in Africa, as in England, woman excels in the culinaryart.  At all events, the mapira meal was better managed by them, than bythe men.  On the present occasion the hunters tumbled in the meal byhandfuls in rapid succession as soon as the water was hot, until itbecame too thick to be stirred about, then it was lifted off the fire,and one man held the pot while another plied the porridge-stick with allhis might to prevent the solid mass from being burnt.  Thus it wasprepared, and thus eaten, in enormous quantities.  No wonder thatdancing and profuse perspiration were esteemed a necessary adjunct tofeeding!At the close of the second edition of supper, which went into four orfive editions before morning, some of the men at the fire next to thatof Kambira engaged in a debate so furious, that the curiosity of Discoand Harold was excited, and they caused Antonio to translate much ofwhat was said.  It is not possible to give a connected account of thisdebate as translated by Antonio.  To overcome the difficulty we shallgive the substance of it in what Disco styled Antonio's "lingo."There were about a dozen natives round the fire, but two of themsustained the chief part in the debate.  One of these was a large manwith a flat nose; the other was a small man with a large frizzy head."Hold 'oos tongue," said Flatnose (so Antonio named him); "tongue toolong--far!""Boh! 'oos brains too short," retorted Frizzyhead contemptuously.An immense amount of chattering by the others followed these pithyremarks of the principals.The question in debate was, Whether the two toes of the ostrichrepresented the thumb and forefinger in man, or the little and ringfingers?  But in a few minutes the subject changed gradually, andsomehow unaccountably, to questions of a political nature,--for, strangeto say, in savage Africa, as in civilised England, politics are keenlydiscussed, doubtless at times with equal wisdom in the one land as inthe other."What dat 'oo say?" inquired Flatnose, on hearing some muttered remarksof Frizzyhead in reference to the misgovernment of chiefs.  Of coursethere, as here, present company was understood to be excepted."Chiefs ob no use--no use at all!" said Frizzyhead so vehemently thatthe men at several of the nearest fires ceased to talk, and began tolisten."Ob no use?" cried Flatnose, with vehemence so superior that theattention of the whole camp was arrested."No!" replied Frizzyhead, still more energetically, "ob no use at all.We could govern ourselves betterer, so what de use of 'um?  The chief'ums fat an' hab plenty wife, but we, who do all de hard work, habhunger, an' only one wife, prehaps none at all.  Dis is bad, unjust,wrong."There was a general shout of "eehee!" from all quarters, which wasequivalent to our "hear, hear.""'Oo know noting at all," retorted Flatnose, who was a loyal subject."Is not de chief de fader of de peepil?  Can dere be peepil widout afader--eh?  God made de chief--who says dat chief is not wise?  He _is_wise, but um's child'n am big fools!"Kambira nodded his head and smiled at this, and there was a generalinclination on the part of most of the audience to applaud, for there,as elsewhere, men have a tendency to be blown about by every wind ofdoctrine.It was amusing to observe the earnestness and freedom with which men ofthe lowest grade assaulted the opinions of their betters on thisoccasion.  Unable at other times, or in any other way, to bringthemselves into importance, they were glad of the opportunity to do sowith their tongues, and, like their civilised types, they assumed an airof mock modesty."Oh!" cried one of these, in reply to Flatnose, "we is littil infants;we is still holdin' on to de boosums ob our moders; we not able to walkalone; we knows notin' at all; but on _dis_ point, we knows that you oldmen speak like de ignorint peepil.  We nebber hear such nonsense--nebber!"No notice was taken of this, but Frizzyhead, whose passion was rising towhite heat in consequence of the glibness of his opponent's tongue,cried out--"'Oo cannot prove wat 'ou says?""Oh yes, can prove it well 'nuff," replied Flatnose, "but 'oos no' gotbrain for onerstand."This last was too much for poor Frizzyhead, who leaped up, stuttered,and cried--"Can 'oo outrun me, then?""Ye--ye--yes!" gasped Flatnose, springing up.Away they went like two hunted springboks, and ran for a mile, thenturned and came back into camp streaming with perspiration, littleFrizzyhead far ahead of the big man, and rejoicing in the fact that hecould beat his opponent in a race, if not in an argument.  Thus waspeace restored.  Pity that civilised arguments cannot be terminated inthe same way!While these discussions were going on, Disco observed that hyenas wereoccasionally to be seen prowling near the verge of the bushes aroundthem, as if anxious to join in the feast, which no doubt was the case."Don't they do mischief sometimes?" he inquired of Antonio."No; him a cowardly beast.  Him come at mans when sleepin' or dyin', butnot at oder time.  'Oo like see me catch um?""Why, yes, if 'ee can do it," answered Disco, with a slight look ofcontempt at his friend, who bore too much resemblance in some points tothe hyena."Come here, den."They went together into the jungle a little distance, and halted underthe branch of a large tree.  To this Antonio suspended a lump of rawflesh, at such a height from the ground that a hyena could only reach itby leaping.  Directly underneath it he planted a short spear in theearth with its point upward."Now, come back to fire," he said to Disco; "'ou soon hear sometin'."Antonio was right.  In a short time afterwards a sharp yell was heard,and, on running to the trap, they found a hyena in its death-agonies.It had leaped at the meat, missed it, and had come down on the spear andimpaled itself."Well, of all the fellers I ever know'd for dodges," said Disco, onreseating himself at the fire, "the men in these latitudes are thecleverest."By this time dancing was going on furiously; therefore, as it would havebeen impossible to sleep, Disco refilled his pipe and amused himself bycontemplating the intelligent countenance of Kambira, who sat smokingbang out of a huge native meerschaum on the other side of the fire."I wonder," said Harold, who lay stretched on a sleeping-mat, leaning onhis right arm and gazing contemplatively at the glowing heart of thefire; "I wonder what has become of Yoosoof?""Was 'ee thinkin' that he deserved to be shoved in there?" asked Disco,pointing to the fire."Not exactly," replied Harold, laughing; "but I have frequently thoughtof the scoundrel, and wondered where he is and what doing now.  I havesometimes thought too, about that girl Azinte, poor thing.  She--"He paused abruptly and gazed at Kambira with great surprise, not unmixedwith alarm, for the chief had suddenly dropped his pipe and glared athim in a manner that cannot be described.  Disco observed the changealso, and was about to speak, when Kambira sprang over the fire andseized Harold by the arm.There was something in the movement, however, which forbade the idea ofan attack, therefore he lay still."What now, Kambira?" he said."Antonio," cried the chief, in a voice that brought the interpreter tohis side in a twinkling; "what name did the white man speak just now?""Azinte," said Harold, rising to a sitting posture.Kambira sat down, drew up his knees to his chin, and clasped his handsround them."Tell me all you know about Azinte," he said in a low, firm voice.It was evident that the chief was endeavouring to restrain some powerfulfeeling, for his face, black though it was, indicated a distinct degreeof pallor, and his lips were firmly compressed together.  Haroldtherefore, much surprised as well as interested, related the little heknew about the poor girl,--his meeting with her in Yoosoof's hut;Disco's kindness to her, and her subsequent departure with the Arab.Kambira sat motionless until he had finished."Do you know where she is gone?" he inquired."No.  I know not; but she was not in the boat with the other slaves whenwe sailed, from which I think it likely that she remained upon thecoast.--But why do you ask, Kambira, why are you so anxious about her?""She is my wife," muttered the chief between his teeth; and, as he saidso, a frown that was absolutely diabolical settled down on his features.For some minutes there was a dead silence, for both Harold and Discofelt intuitively that to offer consolation or hope were out of thequestion.Presently Kambira raised his head, and a smile chased the frown away ashe said--"You have been kind to Azinte, will you be kind to herhusband?""We should be indeed unworthy the name of Englishmen if we said no tothat," replied Harold, glancing at Disco, who nodded approval."Good.  Will you take me with you to the shores of the great salt lake?"said Kambira, in a low, pathetic tone, "will you make me your servant,your slave?""Most gladly will I take you with me as _a friend_," returned Harold."I need not ask why you wish to go," he added,--"you go to seek Azinte?""Yes," cried the chief, springing up wildly and drawing himself up tohis full height, "I go to seek Azinte.  Ho! up men! up!  Ye have feastedenough and slept enough for one night.  Who knows but the slavers may beat our huts while we lie idly here?  Up!  Let us go!"The ringing tones acted like a magic spell.  Savage camps are soonpitched and sooner raised.  In a few minutes the obedient hunters hadbundled up all their possessions, and in less than a quarter of an hourthe whole band was tracking its way by moonlight through the pathlessjungle.The pace at which they travelled home was much more rapid than that atwhich they had set out on their expedition.  Somehow, the vigorous tonesin which Kambira had given command to break up the camp, coupled withhis words, roused the idea that he must have received information ofdanger threatening the village, and some of the more anxious husbandsand fathers, unable to restrain themselves, left the party altogetherand ran back the whole way.  To their great relief, however, they foundon arriving that all was quiet.  The women were singing and at work inthe fields, the children shouting at play, and the men at their wontedoccupation of weaving cotton cloth, or making nets and bows, under thebanyan-trees.Perplexity is not a pleasant condition of existence, nevertheless, toperplexity mankind is more or less doomed in every period of life and inevery mundane scene--particularly in the jungles of central Africa, asHarold and his friends found out many a time to their cost.On arriving at the native village, the chief point that perplexed ourhero there was as to whether he should return to the coast at once, orpush on further into the interior.  On the one hand he wished very muchto see more of the land and its inhabitants; on the other hand, Kambirawas painfully anxious to proceed at once to the coast in search, of hislost wife, and pressed him to set off without delay.The chief was rather an exception in regard to his feelings on thispoint.  Most other African potentates had several wives, and in theevent of losing one of them might have found consolation in the others.But Kambira had never apparently thought of taking another wife afterthe loss of Azinte, and the only comfort he had was in his little boy,who bore a strong resemblance, in some points, to the mother.But although Harold felt strong sympathy with the man, and would havegone a long way out of his course to aid him, he could not avoidperceiving that the case was almost, if not altogether, a hopeless one.He had no idea to what part of the coast Azinte had been taken.  For allhe knew to the contrary, she might have been long ago shipped off to thenorthern markets, and probably was, even while he talked of her, theinmate of an Arab harem, or at all events a piece of goods--a"chattel"--in the absolute possession of an irresponsible master.Besides the improbability of Kambira ever hearing what had become of hiswife, or to what part of the earth she had been transported, there wasalso the difficulty of devising any definite course of action for thechief himself, because the instant he should venture to leave theprotection of the Englishmen he would be certain to fall into the handsof Arabs or Portuguese, and become enslaved.Much of this Harold had not the heart to explain to him.  He dwelt,however, pretty strongly on the latter contingency, though withoutproducing much effect.  Death, the chief replied, he did not fear, andslavery could easily be exchanged for death."Alas! not so easily as you think," said Harold, pointing to Chimbolo,whose sad story he had heard; "they will try _every_ kind of torturebefore they kill you."Chimbolo nodded his head, assenting, and ground his teeth togetherfiercely when this was said.Still Kambira was unmoved; he did not care what they did to him.  Azintewas as life to him, and to search for her he would go in spite of everyconsideration.Harold prevailed on him, however, to agree to wait until he should havespent another month in visiting Chimbolo's tribe, after which hepromised faithfully to return and take him along with his party to thecoast.Neither Harold nor Disco was quite at ease in his mind after making thisarrangement, but they both agreed that no other course could be pursued,the former saying with a sigh that there was no help for it, and thelatter asserting with a grunt that the thing "wos unawoidable."On the following day the journey of exploration was resumed.  Kambiraaccompanied his friends a few miles on the road, and then bade themfarewell.  On the summit of an elevated ridge the party halted andlooked back.  Kambira's manly form could be seen leaning on his spear.Behind him the little village lay embosomed in luxuriant verdure, andglowing in the bright sunshine, while songs and sounds of industryfloated towards them like a sweet melody.  It was with a feeling of keenregret that the travellers turned away, after waving their hands inreply to a parting salute from the stalwart chief, and, descending tothe plain, pushed forward into the unknown wilderness beyond.CHAPTER FOURTEEN.CAMPING, TRAVELLING, SHOOTING, DREAMING, POETISING, PHILOSOPHISING, ANDSURPRISING, IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA.At sunset the travellers halted in a peculiarly wild spot and encampedunder the shelter of a gigantic baobab tree.Two rousing fires were quickly kindled, round which the natives busiedthemselves in preparing supper, while their leaders sat down, the one towrite up his journal, the other to smoke his pipe."Well, sir," said Disco, after a few puffs delivered with extremesatisfaction, "you do seem for to enjoy writin'.  You go at that log ofyours every night, as if it wos yer last will and testament that yecouldn't die happy without exikootin' an' signin' it with yer blood.""A better occupation, isn't it," replied Harold, with a sly glance,"than to make a chimney-pot of my mouth?""Come, sir," returned Disco, with a deprecatory smile, "don't be toohard on a poor feller's pipe.  If you can't enjoy it, that's no argimentagainst it.""How d'you know I can't enjoy it?""Why? cos I s'pose you'd take to it if you did.""Did _you_ enjoy it when you first began?" asked Harold."Well, I can't 'zactly say as I did.""Well, then, if you didn't, that proves that it is not _natural_ tosmoke, and why should I acquire an unnatural and useless habit?""Useless! why, sir, on'y think of wot you loses by not smokin'--wot adeal of enjoyment!""Well, I _am_ thinking," replied Harold, affecting a look of profoundthoughtfulness, "but I can't quite make it out--enjoyment? let me see.Do I not enjoy as good health as you do?""O, cer'nly, sir, cer'nly.  You're quite up to the mark in thatrespect.""Well then, I enjoy my food as well, and can eat as much, can't I?""No doubt of it," replied Disco, with a grin; "I was used to beconsidered raither a dab at wittles, but I must say I knocks under to_you_, sir.""Very good," rejoined Harold, laughing; "then as to sleep, I enjoy sleepquite as soundly as yourself; don't I?""I can't say as to that," replied Disco.  "You see, sir, as I neveropens my eyes arter shuttin' of 'em till the bo's'n pipes all handsahoy, I've no means of knowin' wot you accomplish in that way.""On the whole, then, it seems that I enjoy everything as much as you do,and--""No, not everything; you don't enjoy baccy, you know.--But please, sir,don't go for to moralise; I can't stand it.  You'll spile my pipe if yedo!""Well, I shall spare you," said Harold, "all the more that I perceivesupper is about--"At that moment Antonio, who had gone down to a streamlet which trickledclose at hand, gave utterance to a hideous yell, and came rushing intocamp with a face that was pea-green from terror."Ach!" he gasped, "a lion! queek! your guns!"  Every one leaped up andseized his weapon with marvellous alacrity on receiving an alarm soviolent and unlooked-for."Where away?" inquired Disco, blazing with excitement, and ready at amoment's notice to rush into the jungle and fire both barrels atwhatever should present itself."No, no, don' go," cried Antonio in alarm; "be cautionous."The interpreter's caution was enforced by Chimbolo, who laid his hand onDisco's arm, and looked at him with such solemnity that he felt itnecessary to restrain his ardour.Meanwhile Antonio with trembling steps led Harold to a point in thethicket whence he beheld two bright phosphoric-looking objects which hiscompanion said were the lion's eyes, adding that lion's eyes alwaysshone in that way.Harold threw forward his rifle with the intention of taking aim, butlowered it quickly, for he felt convinced that no lion could possiblyhave eyes so wide apart unless its head were as large as that of anelephant."Nonsense, Antonio!" he said, laughing; "that cannot be a lion.""Ho, yis, him's a lion, for sure," Antonio returned, positively."We shall see."Harold raised his rifle and fired, while Antonio turned and fled, fullyexpecting the wounded beast to spring.  Harold himself half looked forsome such act, and shrank behind a bush by way of precaution, but whenthe smoke cleared away, he saw that the two glowing eyes were gazing athim as fixedly as ever."Pooh!" exclaimed Disco, brushing past; "I knows wot it is.  Many a timeI've seed 'em in the West Injies."Saying which, he went straight up to the supposed lion, picked up acouple of glow-worms, and brought them to the camp-fires, much to theamusement of the men, especially of Jumbo, and greatly to the confusionof the valorous interpreter, who, according to his invariable customwhen danger threatened, was found to have sought refuge in a tree.This incident furnished ground for much discussion and merriment duringsupper, in which Antonio, being in no wise ashamed of himself, joinednoisily; and Chimbolo took occasion to reprove Disco for his rashness,telling him that it was impossible to kill lions in the jungle duringthe darkness of night, and that, if they did pay them a visit, it wouldbe wise to let them be, and trust to the camp-fires keeping them at arespectful distance.  To which Disco retorted that he didn't believethere was any lions in Afriky, for he'd heard a deal about 'em an'travelled far, but had not yet heard the sound of their woices, an', wotwas more, didn't expect to.Before that night was far advanced, Disco was constrained to acknowledgehimself in error, for a veritable lion did actually prowl down to thecamp, and salute them with a roar which had a wonderfully awe-inspiringeffect on every member of the party, especially on those who heard itfor the first time in their lives.Just before the arrival of this nocturnal visitor, one of the men hadbeen engaged in some poetic effusions, which claim preliminary noticehere, because they were rudely terminated by the lion.This man was one of Kambira's people, and had joined the party bypermission.  He was one of those beings who, gifted with something likegenius, or with superior powers of some sort, have sprung up in Africa,as elsewhere, no doubt from time immemorial, to dazzle their fellows fora little, and then pass away, leaving a trail of tradition behind them.The existence there, in time past, of men of mind far in advance oftheir fellows, as well as of heroes whose physical powers weremarvellous, may be assumed from the fact that some such exist at thepresent time, as well as from tradition.  Some of these heroes haveexcited the admiration of large districts by their wisdom, others bytheir courage or their superior dexterity with the spear and bow, likeWilliam Tell and Robin Hood, but the memory of these must soon have beenobliterated for want of literature.  The man who had joined Harold was apoet and a musician.  He was an _improvvisatore_, composed verses on theincidents that occurred as they travelled along, and sang them with anaccompaniment on an instrument called the _sansa_, which had nine ironkeys and a calabash for a sounding-board.The poet's name was Mokompa.  With the free and easy disposition of hisrace, he allowed his fancy to play round the facts of which he sang, andwas never at a loss, for, if the right word did not come readily, hespun out the measure with musical sounds which meant nothing at all.After supper was over, or rather when the first interval of reposeoccurred, Mokompa, who was an obliging and hearty little fellow, wascalled on for a song.  Nothing loath, he seized his sansa and began aditty, of which the following, given by Antonio, may be regarded as aremarkably free, not to say easy, translation:--  MOKOMPA'S SONG.  Kambira goes to hunt,  Yo ho!  Him's spear am nebber blunt,  Yo ho!  Him kill de buff'lo quick,  An' lub de porridge thick;  Him chase de lion too,  An' stick um troo an' troo.  De 'potimus as well,  An' more dan me can tell,  Hab down before um fell,  Yo ho!  De English come to see,  Yo ho!  Dat werry good for we,  Yo ho!  No' take us 'way for slaves,  Nor put us in our graves,  But set de black mans free,  W'en cotch um on de sea.  Dem splendid shooters, too,  We knows what dey can do  Wid boil an' roast an' stew,  Yo ho!  One makes um's gun go crack,  Yo ho!  An elephant on um's back,  Yo ho!  De drefful lion roar,  De gun goes crack once more,  De bullet fly an' splits  One monkey into bits,  Yo ho!  De glow-worm next arise,  De Englishman likewise  Wid werry much surprise,  An' hit um 'tween de eyes,  "Hooray! hooray!" um cries,  An' run to fetch um's prize--  Yo ho!The last "Yo ho!" was given with tremendous energy, and followed bypeals of laughter.It was at this point that the veritable lion thought proper to join in,which he did, as we have said, with a roar so tremendous that it notonly put a sudden stop to the music, but filled the party with so muchalarm that they sprang to their arms with surprising agility.Mindful of Chimbolo's previous warning, neither Harold nor Disco soughtto advance, but both looked at their savage friend for advice.Now, in some parts of Africa there exists a popular belief that thesouls of departed chiefs enter into lions and render them sacred, andseveral members of Harold Seadrift's party entertained this notion.Chimbolo was one of these.  From the sounds of growling and rendingwhich issued from the thicket, he knew that the lion in question wasdevouring part of their buffalo-meat which had been hung on the branchof a neighbouring tree, not, however, near enough to the fires to bevisible.  Believing that the beast was a chief in disguise, Chimboloadvanced a little towards the place where he was, and, much to ourtraveller's amusement, gave him a good scolding."_You_ call yourself a chief, do you--eh?" he said sternly.  "What kindof a chief can _you_ be, to come sneaking about in the dark like this,trying to steal our buffalo-meat!  Are you not ashamed of yourself?  Apretty chief, truly; you are like the scavenger-beetle, and think ofyourself only; you have not the heart of a chief.  Why don't you killyour own beef?  You must have a stone in your chest, and no heart atall.""That's werry flowery lingo, but it don't seem to convince him," saidDisco, with a quiet smile, as the lion, which had been growlingcontinuously over its meal all the time, wound up Chimbolo's speech withanother terrific roar.At this point another believer in transmigration of souls, a quiet manwho seldom volunteered remarks on any subject, stepped forward and beganseriously to expostulate with the lion."It is very wrong of you," he said, "to treat strangers in this fashion.You might have more respect for Englishmen who have come to see yourland, and never did you any harm.  We are travelling peaceably throughthe country; we never kill anybody, and never steal anything; thebuffalo-meat is ours, not yours, and it ill becomes a great chief likeyou to be prowling about in the dark, like a hyena, trying to steal themeat of strangers.  Surely you can hunt for yourself--there is plenty ofmeat in the forest."  [See Livingstone's _Zambesi and its Tributaries_,page 160.]As the lion was equally deaf to this man's reasoning, Harold thought itright to try a more persuasive plan.  He drew up in a line all the menwho had guns, and at a word of command they fired a volley of balls intothe jungle, in the direction whence the sounds issued.  A dead silencefollowed, but it was deemed advisable not to venture in to see theeffect, as men had frequently lost their lives by so doing.  A watch,however, was kept during the night, and the fires were well replenished,for they knew that the king of the forest usually shrinks from doing hisevil deeds in the light of a strong camp-fire.  We say usually--becausethey are not always thus shy.  Authentic instances are on record oflions having leaped into the centre of a bivouac, and carried off one ofthe men in spite of being smitten in the face with flaming firebrands.Fortunately the lion of which we write thought "discretion the betterpart of valour."  He retired peaceably, nevertheless Disco and hisfriend continued to dream of him all night so vividly that they startedup several times, and seized their rifles, under the impression that hehad roared his loudest into their very ears, and after each of theseoccasions they crept back into their sleeping bags to re-dream of thelion!The "bag" which formed each man's couch was made simply of two matssewed together, and left open, not at one of the ends but at one of thesides, so that a man could roll out of or into it more easily than hecould have slid, feet first, into a sack.  It was large enough also fortwo to sleep inside together, always supposing that the two were ofaccommodating dispositions!That they had now reached a land which swarmed with wild animals wasintimated to some extent by the running past, within fifty yards oftheir bivouac, of a troop of elephants.  It was daybreak at the time, sothat, having been thus rudely aroused, they did not deem it necessary toreturn to rest but after taking a hasty mouthful of food, set forth ontheir journey.The usual mode of proceeding on the march was as follows:--They roseabout five o'clock, or soon after the appearance of dawn, and swalloweda cup of tea, with a bit of biscuit, then some of the men folded up theblankets and stowed them away in the bags, others tied up the cookingutensils, etcetera, in bundles, and hung them at the ends ofcarrying-sticks, which they bore upon their shoulders.  The process didnot take long.  They were soon on the march, either in single file, ifthe path were narrow, or in groups, according to fancy, where the groundadmitted of their spreading out.  About nine, a convenient spot waschosen for a halt to breakfast, which meat, although not "_eaten_ thenight before in order to save time in the morning," was at all events_cooked_ on the previous evening for the same end, so that it onlyneeded warming up.  Then the march was resumed; a short rest was allowedin the heat of the day, when, of course, Disco had a pipe and muchsagacious intercourse with his fellows, and they finally encamped forthe remainder of the day and night early in the afternoon.  Thus theytravelled five or six hours at a stretch, and averaged from twelve tofifteen miles a day, which is about as much as Europeans can stand in ahot climate without being oppressed.  This Disco called "taking iteasy," and so it was when compared with the custom of some travellers,whose chief end would appear to be the getting over as much ground aspossible in a given time, in order that they may afterwards boast of thesame, and for the accomplishment of which they are obliged to abuse andlook ferocious at the blacks, cock their pistols, and flourish theirwhips, in a manner which is only worthy of being styled contemptible andcowardly.  We need not say that our friends Harold and Disco had no suchpropensities.  They had kindly consideration for the feelings of their"niggers," coupled with great firmness; became very sociable with them,and thus got hearty, willing work out of them.  But to return from thisdigression.During the day, the number of animals of all sorts that were seen was sogreat as to induce Disco to protest, with a slap of his thigh, that thewhole land, from stem to stern, seemed to him to be one prodigiouszoological garden--it did, an' no mistake about it.Disco was not far wrong.  He and Harold having started ahead of theparty, with Chimbolo as their guide, came on a wonderful variety ofcreatures in rapid succession.  First, they fell in with some largeflocks of guinea-fowl, and shot a few for dinner.  As they advanced,various birds ran across their path, and clouds of turtle-doves filledthe air with the blatter of their wings as they rose above the trees.Ducks, geese, and francolins helped to swell the chorus of sounds.When the sun rose and sent a flood of light over a wide and richlywooded vale, into which they were about to descend, a herd of pallahsstood gazing at the travellers in stupid surprise, and allowed them toapproach within sixty yards before trotting leisurely away.  These andall other animals were passed unmolested, as the party had sufficientmeat at the time, and Harold made it a point not to permit his followersto shoot animals for the mere sake of sport, though several of them wereuncommonly anxious to do so.  Soon afterwards a herd of waterbuckswere passed, and then a herd of koodoos, with two or threemagnificently-horned bucks amongst them, which hurried off to thehillsides on seeing the travellers.  Antelopes also were seen, andbuffaloes, grazing beside their path.Ere long they came upon a small pond with a couple of elephants standingon its brink, cooling their huge sides by drawing water into theirtrunks and throwing it all over themselves.  Behind these were severalherds of zebras and waterbucks, all of which took to flight on "gettingthe wind" of man.  They seemed intuitively to know that he was an enemy.Wild pigs, also, were common, and troops of monkeys, large and small,barked, chattered, grinned, and made faces among the trees.After pitching the camp each afternoon, and having had a mouthful ofbiscuit, the two Englishmen were in the habit of going off to hunt forthe daily supply of fresh meat accompanied by Chimbolo as their guideand game-carrier, Antonio as their interpreter, and Mokompa as theirpoet and jester.  They did not indeed, appoint Mokompa to that post ofhonour, but the little worthy took it upon himself, for the expresspurpose of noting the deeds of the white men, in order to throw hisblack comrades into convulsions over supper by a poetic recital of thesame."It pleases them, an' it don't hurt us," was Disco's observation on thishead.On the afternoon, then, of which we write, the party of four went out tohunt, while the encampment was being prepared under the superintendenceof Jumbo, who had already proved himself to be an able manager and cook,as also had his countrymen Masiko and Zombo."What a rich country!" exclaimed Harold, looking round in admirationfrom the top of a small hillock on as fine a scene as one could wish tobehold, "and what a splendid cotton country it might be if properlycultivated!""So it is," said Disco, "an' I shouldn't wonder if there wos lots ofgold too, if we only knew where to look for it.""Gold!" exclaimed Antonio, who sat winking placidly on the stump of afallen tree; "dere be lots ob gold near Zambesi--an' oder ting too.""Let's hear wot are some of the other things," said Disco."What are dere?--oh, let me see: der be coal, lots ob coal on Zambesi,any amount ob it, an' it burn fuss-rate, too.  Dere be iron-ore, verymuch, an' indigo, an' sugar-cane, an ivory; you hab hear an' see yooselfabout de elephants an' de cottin, an' tobacco.  [See Livingstone's_Zambesi and its Tributaries_, page 52.] Oh! great plenty ob eberytingeberywhere in dis yere country, but," said Antonio, with a shrug of hisshoulders, "no can make noting out ob it on account ob de slave-trade.""Then I 'spose 'ee don't approve of the slave-trade?" said Disco."No, dat am true," replied Antonio; "de country very good forslave-trader, but no good for man like me what want to trade proper.""H'm!  I've more respect for 'ee than I had," said Disco.  "I 'sposeyou've bin up in these parts before now, have 'ee?""No, nevah, but I hab sister what marry one nigger, one slave, what soldhimself, an' him tell me much 'bout it.  Hims bin up here many time.""Sold himself!" repeated Harold in surprise.  "What do you mean?""Mean dat," returned Antonio.  "Him was a black free-man--call himChibanti; him was all alone in de world, lose fader, moder, broder,sister, wife, eberyting by slave-trader, who steal dem all away ormurder dem.  So Chibanti him say, `What de use of be free?'  So him goto one master, who berry good to hims niggers--gib dem plenty to eat an'little to do--an' sole hisself to him.""An' wot did he get for himself?" asked Disco."Got ninety yard ob cottin cloth.""Did he consider himself cheap or dear at that?" inquired Disco."Oh, dear--awful dear!""What has come of him now?" asked Harold."Dunno," answered Antonio.  "After him got de cloth, hims master sendhim to Quillimane wid cargo ob ivory, an' gib him leave to do leetiltrade on hims own account; so him bought a man, a woman, an' a boy, forsixty yard ob cottin, an' wid de rest hired slaves for de voyage down,an' drove a mos' won'erful trade.  But long time since me hear ob him.P'raps hims good master be dead, an' him go wid de rest of de goods an'chattels to a bad master, who berry soon make him sorry him solehisself."Pushing forward for several days in the manner which we have attemptedto describe, our travellers passed through many varied scenes, which,however, all bore one mark in common, namely, teeming animal andvegetable life.  Human beings were also found to be exceedinglynumerous, but not so universally distributed as the others, for,although many villages and hamlets were passed, the inhabitants of whichwere all peacefully inclined and busy in their fields, or with theirnative cotton, iron, and pottery manufactures, vast expanses of richground were also traversed, which, as far as man was concerned, appearedto be absolute solitudes.Entering upon one of these about noon of a remarkably fine day, Haroldcould not help remarking on the strange stillness which pervaded theair.  No sound was heard from beast, bird, or insect; no village wasnear, no rippling stream murmured, or zephyr stirred the leaves; inshort, it was a scene which, from its solitude and profound silence,became oppressive."W'y, sir," said Disco, whose face was bathed in perspiration, "it doseem to me as if we'd got to the fag-end of the world altogether.  Thereain't nothin' nowhere."Harold laughed, and said it looked like it.  But Disco was wrong.  Itwas only the hour when animals seem to find a _siesta_ indispensable,and vegetables as well as air had followed their example.  A few minutessufficed to prove their mistake, for, on entering a piece of woodland, aherd of pallahs, and another of water-bucks, appeared, standing as quietand still as if they were part of a painted landscape.  Then, in passinga thick clump of thorns, they could see, through openings in the bushes,the dim phantom-like forms of buffaloes, with heads lowered and eyesglaring at them, ready to charge, if need be, though too lazy from heat,apparently, to begin the 'fray, and willing to act on the principle of"let be for let be."  Still farther on, a native was observed keeping ata respectful distance.  He had seen the travellers from afar, and comewith noiseless tread to get a nearer view.Halting to rest the party for a few minutes in a shady hollow, Haroldthrew himself at full length on the grass, but Disco, who, strange tosay, did not feel inclined to smoke at the moment--probably because hehad only just finished his fifth pipe a few minutes previously--sauntered on alone to the top of the next ridge.He had barely reached the summit when Harold, who chanced to be lookingafter him, observed that he crouched suddenly behind a bush, and, aftergazing steadfastly for a few seconds over the hill, turned and ran back,making excessively wild demonstrations with head and arms, but utteringno sound.Of course the whole party sprang up and ran towards the excited mariner,and soon were near enough to understand that his violent actions weremeant to caution them to make no noise."Hush!" he said eagerly, on coming near enough to be heard; "keep quietas mice.  There's a slave-gang, or somethin' uncommon like it, goin'along on right athwart us."Without a word of reply, the whole party hurried forward and gained apoint of observation behind the low bushes which crowned the ridge.CHAPTER FIFTEEN.SHOWS SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THE SLAVE-TRADE AT THE FOUNTAIN-HEAD.Down in a gorge, just below the spot where Harold Seadrift and his menlay concealed, a strange sight met the eyes of the two Englishmen, inregard to which, despite all that they had heard and seen, and wereprepared to see, they were as much shocked as if it had never beenpresented even to their imaginations up to that moment.It was a gang of slaves winding its way slowly but steadily through thegorge.The head of the dusky procession was just emerging on the open groundbeyond the gorge when the travellers first came upon it.  The slavesadvanced towards the spot where they lay, passing under it so closelythat they could see the very expressions on the faces of the men, women,and children who composed the gang.  These expressions were varied andvery terrible.  Our travellers had now reached the fountain-head whencethe perennial stream of "Black Ivory" flows out of Africa.  The processof manufacture, although considerably advanced, had not yet reached thatperfection of callous subjection and settled despair which had struckour Englishmen so forcibly in the slave-market of Zanzibar.  There wasanxiety not unmingled with faint hope in the faces of some of the women;and a few of the more stalwart and courageous among the men wore afierce, determined aspect which told of manhood not yet absolutelyprostrated in the dust of abject servility, while, in regard to some ofthe children, surprise at the peculiar circumstances of theirsurroundings had not yet been swallowed up in a condition of chronicterror.They marched in a long line, fastened to each other by chains and ropesand heavy "gorees" or slave-sticks.  The latter implements were polesfrom six to seven feet long, with a fork at the end of each, in whichthe necks of the men were fitted and secured by means of an iron bolt,passing across the throat and riveted at both ends.  To render marchingpossible with such encumbrances, the men went in couples, one behind theother, so that the slave-stick of the leading man could be tied to thestick of his fellow behind, which was slewed round to the front for thepurpose.  Their wrists were also tied, some in front, others behindtheir backs.  Secured thus, Hercules himself might have been reduced toobedience, especially if he had felt the frequent sting of the cruellash that was laid on these captives, a lash whose power was mademanifest by the numerous seams and scars which crossed and recrossedtheir backs and limbs.  The women and children were deemed sufficientlysecure by being fastened to each other with ropes and iron rings roundtheir necks.  All were naked, with the exception of a little piece ofcloth round the loins, and some of the women had infants of a few weeksold strapped to their backs by means of this shred of cloth, whileothers carried baskets on their heads containing meal for the sustenanceof the party during their journey.In advance of the line marched a tall, powerfully-built half-caste,armed with a musket and small axe, and clad in a loose coat, shortdrawers reaching the knees, and straw hat.  He was obviously thecommander of the band.  Behind him came several negroes, also armed withmuskets, and with thick wands for the purpose of flagellation.  Thesewore loin-cloths and turbans or red caps, but nothing more.  Theylaughed, talked and strutted as they went along, forming a markedcontrast to the silent and depressed slaves.At intervals along the line, and in rear, there were stationed one ortwo of these drivers, who urged on their "cattle" with more or lesscruelty, according to their individual impulses or natures.We need scarcely say that this sight filled Harold and Disco not onlywith feelings of horror and pity, but with sensations of toweringindignation that almost suffocated them.  Those who only read of suchthings at home can form but a faint conception of what it is actually tobehold them."We must fight!" muttered Harold between his teeth.Disco could not speak, but he looked at his companion, and gave a nodthat plainly indicated the state of his feelings."'Sh!" hissed Chimbolo, creeping up at that moment and laying his hand,which trembled violently, on Harold's shoulder, "Marizano!""What! the scoundrel in advance?"Chimbolo pointed to the leader of the slave-gang, and almost foamed atthe mouth with suppressed rage.At that moment their attention was attracted to a woman who walkedimmediately behind the slavers.  She was a young and, according toAfrican ideas, a comely girl, but was apparently very weak--so weak thatshe panted and stumbled as she went along, a circumstance which wasaccounted for by the little infant tied to her back, which could nothave been more than a couple of weeks old.  Stumbling against the fallenbranch of a tree, she fell at last with a low wail to the ground, andmade no effort, as on previous occasions, to recover herself.The whole gang stopped, and Marizano, turning back, pushed the womanwith his foot.A fine-looking young man, who was the leader in a couple secured by aslave-stick, seemed to regard this woman with a degree of interest thatargued near relationship.  He started forward half involuntarily whenthe Portuguese half-caste kicked her.  He had forgotten for an instanthis fellow in rear, as well as the bar of the goree across his throat,which checked him violently; at the same time one of the drivers, whohad observed the movement, laid a supple wand across his bare back sosharply as to draw forth a terrific yell of agony.This was too much for Disco Lillihammer.  Unable to restrain himself, heleaped up, seized his rifle by the muzzle with both hands, and, swingingit round his head, rushed upon Marizano with a bursting shout of rageand defiance.It is probable that the half-caste leader, who was by no means destituteof courage, would have stood his ground had his assailant been a man ofcolour, but this unexpected apparition of a white man with a fierycountenance and blue eyes that absolutely flashed as he rushed forwardwith irresistible fury, was too much for him.  Firing hastily, and withbad aim, Marizano turned and fled into the woods, followed by all hismen.  There was however a large band of Ajawa savages in rear, armedwith bows and poisoned arrows.  When he encountered these the Portuguesechief halted, and, rallying his men, took shelter behind trees and beganto fire at the advancing enemy.Seeing this, Harold drew his men together and made them fire a unitedvolley, which had the effect of utterly routing the slavers.  Discomeanwhile, finding that he could not overtake Marizano, at last did whathe ought to have done at first--kneeled down, took deliberate aim athim, and fired.  His agitation prevented accuracy of aim; neverthelesshe succeeded in sending a bullet through the fleshy part of the man'sarm, above the elbow, which effectually put him to flight.Returning to the slaves, who had been left standing where they werefirst stopped, in a state of great surprise and perplexity, he assistedhis companions in freeing them.  This was easy enough in regard to thewomen and children, but the gorees on the men were very difficult toremove.  Being riveted, as we have said, it became necessary to splitthe forks with hatchets, an operation which endangered the heads of thepoor captives and hurt their galled necks considerably.  It wasaccomplished however in the midst of a deal of excitement and hurriedconversation, while Jumbo and his comrades kindled fires, and Haroldbade the women cook the meal--which they had hitherto carried--forthemselves and their children.  They seemed to consider this too goodnews to be true, but on being encouraged, began with alacrity."Don't be afeared, lass," cried Disco, patting a young woman on thehead, "eat as much as 'ee like.  You need it, poor thing, an' stuff thechilder till they can't hold no more.  Bu'st 'em if 'ee can.  Theslavers won't come back here in a hurry.  Ha!  I only wish they would,an' let us have a brush with 'em.  But there's no such luck.  Cowardsnever fight 'xcept w'en they're sure to win.--Now, piccaninny, here youare," he said, stuffing some raw mapira meal into the open mouth of athin little girl of about six or seven, who was gazing at him inopen-eyed surprise; "don't put off time, you're half-starved already!"The little black skeleton began to chew the dry meal with evidentsatisfaction, but without taking her eyes off her deliverer."Who are _you_?" asked a somewhat older girl of Harold, whom sheregarded with looks of reverence and wonder.Of course Harold did not understand her, but he immediately calledAntonio, who translated."Who are you?" she said; "the other people tied and starved us, but youcut the ropes and tell us to eat; what sort of people are you?  Wheredid you come from?"To this Harold replied briefly that he was an Englishman, who hatedslavers and slavery, but he said nothing more at that time, as heintended to have a palaver and explanation with the freed captives aftertheir meal was over.There was a great clapping of hands among the slaves, expressive ofgratitude, on hearing that they were free.About a hundred sat down to that meal, most of whom were women andchildren, and the manner in which they devoured the food set beforethem, told eloquently of their previous sufferings.  At first theytimidly held back, scarce venturing to believe that their new captors,as they thought them, were in earnest.  But when their doubts and fearswere removed, they attacked the mapira porridge like ravening wolves.Gradually the human element began to reappear, in the shape of a commentor a smile, and before long the women were chatting together, and a fewof the stronger among the young children were making feeble attempts toplay.When the oldest man of the party, who appeared to be between twenty andthirty, was brought forward and questioned, he gave some interesting andstartling information."Tell him," said Harold to Antonio, "that we are Englishmen; that webelong to the same nation as the great white man Dr Livingstone, whotravelled through this land some years ago--the nation which hatesslavery because the Great God hates it, and would have all men to befree, to serve each other in love, and to do to other people as theywould have other people do to them.  Ask him, also, where he comes from,and who captured him and his companions."To this the negro replied--"What the white man says may be true, but thewhite men seem to tell lies too much.  The men who killed our warriors,burned our villages, and took our women and children away, came to ussaying that they were friends; that they were the servants of the samepeople as the white man Livingstone, and wanted to trade with us.  Whenwe believed and trusted them, and were off our guard, they fired on uswith their guns.  We know not what to think or to believe."Harold was much perplexed by this reply, for he knew not what evidenceto cite in proof that he, at least was not a deceiver."Tell him," he said at length, "that there are false white men as wellas true, and that the best proof I can give him that I am one of thetrue is, to set him and his friends at liberty.  They are now as free togo where they please as we are."On receiving this assurance the negro retired to consult with hisfriends.  Meanwhile Antonio, who seemed to have been touched by theunvarying kindness with which he had been treated by his employers,opened his mind to them, and gave them a good deal of information, ofwhich the substance is as follows:--At that time the merchants of the Portuguese inland town of Tette, onthe Zambesi, were carrying on the slave-trade with unusual vigour, forthis reason, that they found it difficult to obtain ivory except inexchange for slaves.  In former years they had carried on a trade inivory with a tribe called the Banyai, these Banyai being greatelephant-hunters, but it happened that they went to war with anothertribe named the Matabele, who had managed to steal from them all theirwomen and children.  Consequently, the forlorn Banyai said to the Tettemerchants, when they went to trade with them as they had been accustomedto do, "We do not want your merchandise.  Bring us women and children,and you shall have as much ivory as you wish."These good people of Tette--being chiefly half-caste Portuguese, andunder Portuguese government, and claiming, as they do, to be thepossessors of that region of Africa--are so utterly incapable of holdingtheir own, that they are under the necessity of paying tribute to atribe of savages who come down annually to Tette to receive it, and who,but for that tribute, would, as they easily could, expel them from theland.  These merchants of Tette, moreover, in common with all thePortuguese in Africa, are by the laws of Portugal prohibited fromengaging in the _export_ slave-trade.  They are not, however, forbiddento engage temporarily in the "domestic slave-trade," hence they had sentout slaving parties--in other words, robbers, kidnappers, murderers--whohired the warlike Ajawa tribe to aid them in killing the Manganja men,and robbing them of their wives and little ones, by which means theywere enabled to supply the demand for such "cattle" among the Banyai,and thus obtained the desired supply of ivory!  So vigorously had thisslave traffic been carried on, at the time of which we write, that nofewer than two hundred people--mostly women and children--were carriedout of the hill-country every week.  [See _The Universities' Mission toCentral Africa_, page 112.]In a short time the negro returned to the place where Harold and Discowere seated, and said that he believed his white deliverers were truemen, but added that he and his people had no home to go to; theirvillage having been burnt, and all the old people and warriors killed ordispersed by Marizano, who was a terribly cruel man.  In proof of thisassertion he said that only the day before, Marizano had shot two of thewomen for attempting to untie their thongs; a man had been killed withan axe because he had broken-down with fatigue; and a woman had herinfant's brains dashed out because she was unable to carry it, as wellas the load assigned to her."It is difficult to decide what one should do in these circumstances,"said Harold to Disco.  "You know it would never do to leave thesehelpless people here to starve; but if we take them on with us ourprogress will be uncommonly slow.""We'd better take 'em back," said Disco."Back!  Where to?""W'y, to the last village wot we passed through.  It ain't more than aday's march, an' I'm sure the old feller as is capting of it would takecare o' the lot.""There is good advice in that, yet I grudge to go back," said Harold;"if there were a village the same distance in advance, I would rathertake them on.""But there ain't," returned Disco.  "Hallo!  I say, wot's wrong withTony?"The interpreter came forward with a look of much excitement as he spoke."What now, Antonio?""Oh! it's drefful," replied the interpreter.  "Dey tells me have hearMarizano speak ob anoder slaving party what go straight to Kambira'svillage for attack it.""Who told you that?  Are they sure?" asked Harold hastily."Two, t'ree mans tole me," replied Antonio.  "All say same ting.  Toolate to help him now, me's 'fraid.""Never say too late," cried Disco, starting up; "never say die whilethere's a shot in the locker.  It may be time enough yet if we only looksharp.  I votes that we leave nearly all the provisions we have withthese poor critters here; up anchor, 'bout ship, clap on all sail, andaway this werry minit."Harold agreed with this advice heartily, and at once acted on it.  Thearrangements were quickly made, the provisions distributed, anexplanation made, and in less than an hour the travellers were retracingtheir steps in hot haste.By taking a straight line and making forced marches, they arrived insight of the ridge where they had last seen Kambira, on the evening ofthe third day.  As they drew near Harold pushed impatiently forward,and, outrunning his companions, was first to reach the summit.  Disco'sheart sank within him, for he observed that his companion stood still,bowed his head, and covered his face with both hands.  He soon joinedhim, and a groan burst from the seaman's breast when he saw densevolumes of smoke rising above the spot where the village had so recentlylain a picture of peaceful beauty.Even their followers, accustomed though they were, to scenes and deedsof violence and cruelty, could not witness the grief of the Englishmenunmoved."P'raps," said Disco, in a husky voice, "there's some of 'em left alive,hidin' in the bushes.""It may be so," replied Harold, as he descended the slope with rapidstrides.  "God help them!"A few minutes sufficed to bring them to the scene of ruin, but thedevastation caused by the fire was so great that they had difficulty inrecognising the different spots where the huts had stood.  Kambira's hutwas, however, easily found, as it stood on a rising ground.  There thefight with the slavers had evidently been fiercest, for around it laythe charred and mutilated remains of many human bodies.  Some of thesewere so far distinguishable that it could be told whether they belongedto man, woman, or child."Look here!" said Disco, in a deep, stern voice, as he pointed to anobject on the ground not far from the hut.It was the form of a woman who had been savagely mangled by hermurderers.  The upturned and distorted face proved it to be Yohama, thegrandmother of little Obo.  Near to her lay the body of a grey-hairednegro, who might to judge from his position, have fallen in attemptingto defend her."Oh! if the people of England only saw this sight!" said Harold, in alow tone; "if they only believed in and _realised_ this fact, therewould be one universal and indignant shout of `No toleration of slaveryanywhere throughout the world!'""Look closely for Kambira or his son," he added, turning to his men.A careful search among the sickening remains was accordingly made, butwithout any discovery worth noting being made, after which they searchedthe surrounding thickets.  Here sad evidence of the poor fugitiveshaving been closely pursued was found in the dead bodies of many of theold men and women, and of the very young children and infants; also thebodies of a few of the warriors.  All these had been speared, chieflythrough the back.  Still they were unsuccessful in finding the bodies ofthe chief or his little boy."It's plain," said Disco, "that they have either escaped or been tookprisoners.""Here is some one not quite dead," said Harold,--"Ah! poor fellow!"He raised the unfortunate man's head on his knee, and recognised thefeatures of the little man who had entertained them with his tunes onthe native violin.It was in vain that Antonio tried to gain his attention while Discomoistened his lips with water.  He had been pierced in the chest with anarrow.  Once only he opened his eyes, and a faint smile played on hislips, as if he recognised friends, but it faded quickly and left thepoor musician a corpse.Leaving, with heavy hearts, the spot where they had spent such pleasantdays and nights, enjoying the hospitality of Kambira and his tribe, ourtravellers began to retrace their steps to the place where they had leftthe rescued slaves, but that night the strong frame of Disco Lillihammersuccumbed to the influence of climate.  He was suddenly stricken withAfrican fever, and in a few hours became as helpless as a little child.In this extremity Harold found it necessary to encamp.  He selected thehighest and healthiest spot in the neighbourhood, caused his followersto build a rude, but comparatively comfortable, hut and set himselfdiligently to hunt for, and to tend, his sick friend.CHAPTER SIXTEEN.TREATS OF LOVE, HATRED, AND SORROW, AND PROVES THAT SLAVERY AND ITSCONSEQUENCES ARE NOT CONFINED TO BLACK MEN AND WOMEN.We must now change the scene to the garden of that excellent Governor,Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, and the date to threemonths in advance of the period in which occurred the events related inthe last chapter."Maraquita, I am sorry to find that you still persist in encouragingthat morbid regret for the loss of one who cannot now be recovered."Thus spoke the Governor in tones that were unusually petulant for onewho idolised his child."Father, why did you sell her without saying a word to me about yourintention?  It was very, very, _very_ unkind--indeed it was."Poor Maraquita's eyes were already red and swollen with much weeping,nevertheless she proceeded to increase the redness and the swelling by arenewed burst of passionate distress.The worthy Governor found it difficult to frame a reply or to administersuitable consolation, for in his heart he knew that he had sold Azinte,as it were surreptitiously, to Marizano for an unusually large sum ofmoney, at a time when his daughter was absent on a visit to a friend.The noted Portuguese kidnapper, murderer, rebel and trader in blackivory, having recovered from his wound, had returned to the town, and,being well aware of Azinte's market value, as a rare and remarkablybeautiful piece of ivory of extra-superfine quality, had threatened, aswell as tempted, Governor Letotti beyond his powers of resistance.Marizano did not want the girl as his own slave.  He wanted dollars,and, therefore, destined her for the markets of Arabia or Persia, wherethe smooth-tongued and yellow-skinned inhabitants hold that robbery,violence, and cruelty, such as would make the flesh of civilised peoplecreep, although horrible vices in themselves, are nevertheless, quitejustifiable when covered by the sanction of that miraculous talismancalled a "domestic institution."  The British Government had, by treaty,agreed to respect slavery in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, asa domestic institution with which it would not interfere!Governor Letotti's heart had smitten him at first for he really was anamiable man, and felt kindly disposed to humanity at large, slavesincluded.  Unfortunately the same kindliness was concentrated withtenfold power on himself, so that when self-interest came into play theamiable man became capable of deeds that Marizano himself might havebeen proud of.  The only difference, in fact, between the two was thatthe Governor, like the drunkard, often felt ashamed of himself, andsometimes wished that he were a better man, while the man-stealergloried in his deeds, and had neither wish nor intention to improve."Maraquita," said Senhor Letotti, still somewhat petulantly, though withmore of remonstrance in his tone, "how can you speak so foolishly?  Itwas out of my power you know, to speak to you when you were absent aboutwhat I intended to do.  Besides, I was, at the time, very much in needof some ready money, for, although I am rich enough, there are timeswhen most of my capital is what business men called `locked up,' andtherefore not immediately available.  In these circumstances, Marizanocame to me with a very tempting offer.  But there are plenty ofgood-looking, amiable, affectionate girls in Africa.  I can easily buyyou another slave quite as good as Azinte.""As good as Azinte!" echoed Maraquita wildly, starting up and gazing ather father with eyes that flashed through her tears, "Azinte, who hasopened her heart to me--her bursting, bleeding heart--and told me allher former joys and all her present woes, and who loves me as sheloves--ay, better than she loves--her own soul, merely because I droppeda few tears of sympathy on her little hand!  Another as good as Azinte!"she cried with increasing vehemence; "would _you_ listen with patienceto any one who should talk to you of another as good as Maraquita?""Nay, but," remonstrated the Governor, "you are now raving; yourfeelings towards Azinte cannot be compared with my love for _you_.""If you loved me as I thought you did, you would not--you could not--have thus taken from me my darling little maid.  Oh! shame, shame onyou, father--"She could say no more, but rushed from the room to fling herself downand sob out her feelings in the privacy of her own chamber, where shewas sought out by the black cook, who had overheard some of theconversation, and was a sympathetic soul.  But that amiable domestichappened to be inopportunely officious; she instantly fled from thechamber, followed by the neatest pair of little slippers imaginable,which hit her on the back of her woolly head,--for Maraquita, like otherspoilt children, had made up her mind _not_ to be comforted.Meanwhile the Governor paced the floor of his drawing-room with uneasyfeelings, which, however, were suddenly put to flight by the report of agun.  Hastening to the window, he saw that the shot had been fired by awar-steamer which was entering the bay."Ha! the `Firefly;' good!" exclaimed the Governor, with a gratifiedlook; "this will put it all right."He said nothing more, but left the room hastily.  It may however be aswell to explain that his remark had reference to the mutual affectionwhich he was well aware existed between his daughter and the gallantLieutenant Lindsay.  He had not, indeed, the most remote intention ofpermitting Maraquita to wed the penniless officer, but he had noobjection whatever to their flirting as much as they pleased; and hereadily perceived that nothing would be more likely to take theSenhorina's thoughts off her lost maid than the presence of her lover.There was a bower in a secluded corner of the Governor Letotti's garden,a very charming bower indeed, in which Lieutenant Lindsay had been wontat times when duty to the Queen of England permitted, to hold sweetconverse with the "queen of his soul."  What that converse was itneither becomes us to say nor the reader to inquire.  Perhaps it hadreference to astronomy, perchance to domestic economy.  At all events itwas always eminently satisfactory to both parties engaged, save when theSenhorina indulged in a little touch of waywardness, and sent the poorofficer back to his ship with a heavy heart, for the express purpose ofteaching him the extent of her power and the value of her favour.  Sheoverclouded him now and then, just to make him the more ardently longfor sunshine, and to convince him that in the highest sense of the wordhe was a slave!To this bower, then, the Senhorina returned with a sad heart and swolleneyes, to indulge in vain regrets.  Her sorrows had overwhelmed her tosuch an extent that she failed to observe the `Firefly's' salute.  Itwas therefore with a look of genuine surprise and agitation that shesuddenly beheld Lieutenant Lindsay, who had availed himself of the firstfree moment, striding up the little path that led to the bower."Maraquita!" he exclaimed, looking in amazement at the countenance ofhis lady-love, which was what Norsemen style "begrutten."But Maraquita was in no mood to be driven out of her humour, even by herlover."I am miserable," she said with vehemence, clenching one of her littlefists as though she meditated an assault on the lieutenant--"utterly,absolutely, inconsolably miserable."If Lindsay had entertained any doubt regarding the truth of herassertion, it would have been dispelled by her subsequent conduct, forshe buried her face in a handkerchief and burst into tears."Beloved, adorable, tender, delicious Maraquita," were words which leaptinto the lieutenant's mind, but he dare not utter them with his lips.Neither did he venture to clasp Maraquita's waist with his left arm, layher pretty little head on his breast and smooth her luxuriant hair withhis right hand, though he felt almost irresistibly tempted so to do--entirely from feelings of pity, of course,--for the Senhorina hadhitherto permitted no familiarities beyond a gentle pressure of the handon meeting and at parting.It is unnecessary to repeat all that the bashful, though ardent, man ofwar said to Maraquita, or all that Maraquita said to the man of war;how, ignoring the celestial orbs and domestic economy, she launched outinto a rhapsodical panegyric of Azinte; told how the poor slave hadunburdened her heart to her about her handsome young husband and herdarling little boy in the far off interior, from whom she had beenrudely torn, and whom she never expected to see again; and how she,Maraquita, had tried to console Azinte by telling her that there was aheaven where good people might hope to meet again, even though theynever met on earth, and a great deal more besides, to all of which theearnest lieutenant sought to find words wherewith to express his pityand sympathy, but found them not, though he was at no loss to find wordsto tell the queen of his soul that, in the peculiar circumstances of thecase, and all things considered, his love for her (Maraquita) wastenfold more intense than it had ever been before!"Foolish boy," said the Senhorina, smiling through her tears, "what isthe use of telling me that?  Can it do any good to Azinte?""Not much, I'm afraid," replied the lieutenant.  "Well, then, don't talknonsense, but tell me what I am to do to recover my little maid.""It is impossible for me to advise," said the lieutenant with aperplexed look."But you _must_ advise," said Maraquita, with great decision."Well, I will try.  How long is it since Azinte was taken away fromyou?""About two weeks.""You say that Marizano was the purchaser.  Do you know to what part ofthe coast he intended to convey her?""How should I know?  I have only just heard of the matter from myfather.""Well then, you must try to find out from your father all that he knowsabout Marizano and his movements.  That is the first step.  After that Iwill consider what can be done.""Yes, Senhor," said Maraquita, rising suddenly, "you must considerquickly, and you must act at once, for you must not come here againuntil you bring me news of Azinte."Poor Lindsay, who knew enough of the girl's character to believe her tobe thoroughly in earnest, protested solemnly that he would do hisutmost.All that Maraquita could ascertain from her father was, that Marizanomeant to proceed to Kilwa, the great slave-depot of the coast, there tocollect a large cargo of slaves and proceed with them to Arabia,whenever he had reason to believe that the British cruisers were out ofthe way.  This was not much to go upon, but the Senhorina was asunreasonable as were the Egyptians of old, when they insisted on theIsraelites making bricks without straw.He was unexpectedly helped out of his dilemma by Captain Romer, whocalled him into his cabin that same evening, told him that he hadobtained information of the movements of slavers, which induced him tothink it might be worth while to watch the coast to the northward ofCape Dalgado, and bade him prepare for a cruise in charge of the cutter,adding that the steamer would soon follow and keep them in view.With a lightened heart Lindsay went off to prepare, and late that nightthe cutter quietly pulled away from the `Firefly's' side, with awell-armed crew, and provisioned for a short cruise.Their object was to proceed as stealthily as possible along the coast,therefore they kept inside of islands as much as possible, and cruisedabout a good deal at nights, always sleeping on board the boat, as thelow-lying coast was very unhealthy, but landing occasionally to obtainwater and to take a survey of the sea from convenient heights.Early one morning as they were sailing with a very light breeze, betweentwo small islands, a vessel was seen looming through the haze, not farfrom shore.Jackson, one of the men, who has been introduced to the reader at anearlier part of this narrative, was the first to observe the strangers."It's a brig," he said; "I can make out her royals.""No, it's a barque," said the coxswain.A little midshipman, named Midgley, differed from both, and said it wasa large dhow, for he could make out the top of its lateen sail."Whatever it is, we'll give chase," said Lindsay, ordering the men toput out the oars and give way, the sail being of little use.In a few minutes the haze cleared sufficiently to prove that Midgley wasright.  At the same time it revealed to those on board the dhow thatthey were being chased by the boat of a man-of-war.  The little windthat blew at the time was insufficient to enable the dhow to weather apoint just ahead of her, and the cutter rowed down on her so fast thatit was evidently impossible for her to escape.Seeing this, the commander of the dhow at once ran straight for theshore.  Before the boat could reach her she was among the breakers onthe bar, which were so terrible at that part of the coast as to renderlanding in a small boat quite out of the question.  In a few minutes thedhow was hurled on the beach and began to break up, while her crew andcargo of slaves swarmed into the sea and tried to gain the shore.  Itseemed to those in the boat that some hundreds of negroes werestruggling at one time in the seething foam."We must risk it, and try to save some of the poor wretches," criedLindsay; "give way, lads, give way!"The boat shot in amongst the breakers, and was struck by several seas insuccession, and nearly swamped ere it reached the shore.  But they weretoo late to save many of the drowning.  Most of the strongest of theslaves had gained the shore and taken to the hills in wild terror, underthe impression so carefully instilled into them by the Arabs, that theonly object the Englishmen had in view was to catch, cook, and eat them!The rest were drowned, with the exception of two men and seven littlechildren, varying from five to eight years of age, who were foundcrawling on the beach, in such a state of emaciation that they could notfollow their companions into the bush.  They tried, however, in theirown feeble, helpless way, to avoid capture and the terrible fate whichthey thought awaited them.These were soon lifted tenderly into the boat."Here, Jackson," cried Lindsay, lifting one of the children in hisstrong arms, and handing it to the sailor, "carry that one verycarefully, she seems to be almost gone.  God help her, poor, poorchild!"There was good cause for Lindsay's pity, for the little girl was so thinthat every bone in her body was sticking out--her elbow and knee-jointsbeing the largest parts of her shrunken limbs, and it was found that shecould not rise or even stretch herself out, in consequence, as wasafterwards ascertained, of her having been kept for many days in thedhow in a sitting posture, with her knees doubled up against her face.Indeed, most of the poor little things captured were found to be more orless stiffened from the same cause.An Arab interpreter had been sent with Lindsay, but he turned out to beso incapable that it was scarcely possible to gain any information fromhim.  He was either stupid in reality, or pretended to be so.  Thelatter supposition is not improbable, for many of the interpretersfurnished to the men-of-war on that coast were found to be favourable tothe slavers, insomuch that they have been known to mislead those whomthey were paid to serve.With great difficulty the cutter was pulled through the surf.  Thatafternoon the `Firefly' hove in sight, and took the rescued slaves onboard.Next day two boats from the steamer chased another dhow on shore, butwith even less result than before, for the whole of the slaves escapedto the hills.  On the day following, however, a large dhow was captured,with about a hundred and fifty slaves on board, all of whom wererescued, and the dhow destroyed.The dhows which were thus chased or captured were all regular andundisguised slavers.  Their owners were openly engaged in what they knewwas held to be piracy alike by the Portuguese, the Sultan of Zanzibar,and the English.  They were exporting slaves from Africa to Arabia andPersia, which is an illegal species of traffic.  In dealing with these,no difficulty was experienced except the difficulty of catching them.When caught, the dhows were invariably destroyed and the slaves setfree--that is to say, carried to those ports where they might be setfree with safety.But there were two other sorts of traffickers in the bodies and souls ofhuman beings, who were much more difficult to deal with.There were, first the legal slave-traders, namely, the men who conveyslaves by sea from one part of the Sultan of Zanzibar's dominions toanother.  This kind of slavery was prosecuted under the shelter of whatwe have already referred to as a domestic institution!  It involved, aswe have said before, brutality, injustice, cruelty, theft, murder, andextermination, but, being a domestic institution of Zanzibar, it washeld to be _legal_, and the British Government have recognised andtolerated it by treaty for a considerable portion of this century!It is, however, but justice to ourselves to say, that our Governmententered into the treaty with the view of checking, limiting, andmitigating the evils of the slave-trade.  We have erred in recognisingany form of slavery, no matter how humane our object was--one proof ofwhich is that we have, by our interference, unintentionally increasedthe evils of slavery instead of abating them.It is worth while remarking here, that slavery is also a domesticinstitution in Arabia and Persia.  If it be right that we should notinterfere with the Zanzibar institution, why should we interfere withthat of Arabia or Persia?  Our treaty appears to have been founded onthe principle that we ought to respect domestic institutions.  Wemaintain a squadron on the east coast of Africa to stop the flow ofAfricans to the latter countries, while we permit the flow by _treaty_,as well as by practice, to the former.  Is this consistent?  The onlydifference between the two cases is one of distance, not of principle.But to return to our point--the legal traders.  In consequence of theSultan's dominions lying partly on an island and partly on the mainland,his domestic institution necessitates boats, and in order to distinguishbetween his boats and the pirates, there is a particular season fixed inwhich he may carry his slaves by sea from one part of his dominions toanother; and each boat is furnished with papers which prove it to be a"legal trader."  This is the point on which the grand fallacy of _our_interference hinges.  The "domestic institution" would be amply suppliedby about 4000 slaves a year.  The so-called legal traders are simplylegalised deceivers, who transport not fewer than 30,000 slaves a year!It must be borne in mind that these 30,000 represent only a portion--theZanzibar portion--of the great African slave-trade.  From the Portuguesesettlements to the south, and from the north by way of Egypt, the exportof negroes as slaves is larger.  It is estimated that the total numberof human beings enslaved on the east and north-east coast of Africa isabout 70,000 a year.  As all authorities agree in the statement that, atthe _lowest_ estimate, only _one_ out of every five captured survives togo into slavery, this number represents a loss to Africa of 350,000human beings a year.  They leave Zanzibar with full cargoes continually,with far more than is required for what we may term home-consumption.Nevertheless, correct papers are furnished to them by the Sultan, whichprotects them from British cruisers within the prescribed limits,namely, between Cape Dalgado and Lamoo, a line of coast about 1500 milesin extent.  But it is easy for them to evade the cruisers in these wideseas and extensive coasts, and the value of Black Ivory is so great thatthe loss of a few is but a small matter.  On reaching the northernlimits the legal traders become pirates.  They run to the northward, andtake their chance of being captured by cruisers.The reason of all this is very obvious.  The Sultan receives nearly halfa sovereign a head for each slave imported into Zanzibar, and ourGovernments, in time past, have allowed themselves to entertain thebelief, that, by treaty, the Sultan could be induced to destroy this thechief source of his revenue!Surely it is not too much to say, that _Great Britain ought to enterinto no treaty whatever in regard to slavery, excepting such as shallprovide for the absolute, total, and immediate extirpation thereof bywhatsoever name called_.Besides these two classes of slavers,--the open, professional pirates,and the sneaking, deceiving "domestic" slavers,--there are theslave-smugglers.  They are men who profess to be, and actually are,legal traders in ivory, gum, copal, and other produce of Africa.  Thesefellows manage to smuggle two or three slaves each voyage to the BlackIvory markets, under pretence that they form part of the crew of theirdhows.  It is exceedingly difficult, almost impossible, for the officersof our cruisers to convict these smugglers--to distinguish betweenslaves and crews, consequently immense numbers of slaves are carried offto the northern ports in this manner.  Sometimes these dhows carry Arabor other passengers, and when there are so many slaves on board that itwould be obviously absurd to pretend that they formed part of the crew,the owner dresses the poor wretches up in the habiliments that come mostreadily to hand, and passes them off as the wives or servants of thesepassengers.  Any one might see at a glance that the stupid, silent,timid-looking creatures, who have had almost every human element beatenout of them, are nothing of the sort, but there is no means of _proving_them other than they are represented to be.  If an interpreter were toask them they would be ready to swear anything that their owner hadcommanded; hence the cruisers are deceived in every way--in many waysbesides those now mentioned--and our philanthropic intentions areutterly thwarted; for the rescuing and setting free of 1000 or 2000negroes a year out of the 30,000 annually exported, is not an adequateresult for our great expense in keeping a squadron on the coast,especially when we consider that hundreds, probably thousands, of slavesperish amid horrible sufferings caused by the efforts of theman-stealers to avoid our cruisers.  These would probably not lose theirlives, and the entire body of slaves would suffer less, if we did notinterfere at all.From this we do not argue that non-interference would be best, but thatas our present system of repression does not effectively accomplish whatis aimed at, it ought to be changed.  What the change should be, manywise and able men have stated.  Their opinion we cannot quote here, butone thing taught to us by past experience is clear, we cannot cure theslave-trade by merely limiting it.  Our motto in regard to slavery oughtto be--_Total and immediate extinction everywhere_.CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.STRONG MEASURES LEAD TO UNEXPECTED DISCOVERIES."I'm terribly worried and perplexed," said Lieutenant Lindsay oneafternoon to Midshipman Midgley, as they were creeping along the coastin the neighbourhood of Cape Dalgado."Why so?" inquired the middy."Because I can learn nothing whatever about the movements of Marizano,"replied the Lieutenant.  "I have not spoken to you about this manhitherto, because--because--that is to say--the fact is, it wasn't worthwhile, seeing that you know no more about him than I do, perhaps not somuch.  But I can't help thinking that we might have learned somethingabout him by this time, only our interpreter is such an unmitigated ass,he seems to understand nothing--to pick up nothing.""Indeed!" exclaimed the midshipman; "I'm surprised to hear you say so,because I heard Suliman whispering last night with that half-castefellow whom we captured along with the other niggers, and I am confidentthat he mentioned the name of Marizano several times.""Did he?  Well now, the rascal invariably looks quite blank when Imention Marizano's name, and shakes his head, as if he had never heardof it before.""Couldn't you intimidate him into disgorging a little of his knowledge?"suggested Midgley, with an arch look."I have thought of that," replied Lindsay, with a frown.  "Come, it'snot a bad idea; I'll try!  Hallo!  Suliman, come aft, I want you."Lieutenant Lindsay was one of those men who are apt to surprise peopleby the precipitancy of their actions.  He was not, indeed, hasty; butwhen his mind was made up he was not slow in proceeding to action.  Itwas so on the present occasion, to the consternation of Suliman, who hadhitherto conceived him to be rather a soft easy-going man."Suliman," he said, in a low but remarkably firm tone of voice, "youknow more about Marizano than you choose to tell me.  Now," hecontinued, gazing into the Arab's cold grey eyes, while he pulled arevolver from his coat-pocket and cocked it, "I intend to make you tellme all you know about him, or to blow your brains out."He moved the pistol gently as he spoke, and placed his forefinger on thetrigger."I not know," began Suliman, who evidently did not believe him to bequite in earnest; but before the words had well left his lips the drumof his left ear was almost split by the report of the pistol, and a partof his turban was blown away."You don't know? very well," said Lindsay, recocking the pistol, andplacing the cold muzzle of it against the Arab's yellow nose.This was too much for Suliman.  He grew pale, and suddenly fell on hisknees."Oh! stop! no--no! not fire! me tell you 'bout 'im.""Good, get up and do so," said the Lieutenant, uncocking the revolver,and returning it to his pocket; "and be sure that you tell me all, elseyour life won't be worth the value of the damaged turban on your head."With a good deal of trepidation the alarmed interpreter thereupon gaveLindsay all the information he possessed in regard to the slaver, whichamounted to this, that he had gone to Kilwa, where he had collected aband of slaves sufficient to fill a large dhow, with which he intended,in two days more, to sail, in company with a fleet of slavers, for thenorth."Does he intend to touch at Zanzibar?" inquired Lindsay."Me tink no," replied the interpreter; "got many pritty garls--gostraight for Persia."On hearing this the Lieutenant put the cutter about, and sailed out tosea in search of the `Firefly,' which he knew could not at that time beat any great distance from the shore.He found her sooner than he had expected; and, to his immenseastonishment as well as joy, one of the first persons he beheld onstepping over the side of his ship was Azinte."You have captured Marizano, sir, I see," he said to Captain Romer."Not the scoundrel himself, but one of his dhows," replied the Captain."He had started for the northern ports with two heavily-laden vessels.We discovered him five days ago, and, fortunately, just beyond theprotected water, so that he was a fair and lawful prize.  The first ofhis dhows, being farthest out from shore, we captured, but the other,commanded by himself, succeeded in running ashore, and he escaped; withnearly all his slaves--only a few of the women and children beingdrowned in the surf.  And now, as our cargo of poor wretches is prettylarge, I shall run for the Seychelles.  After landing them I shallreturn as fast as possible, to intercept a few more of these pirates.""To the Seychelles!" muttered the Lieutenant to himself as he wentbelow, with an expression on his countenance something between surpriseand despair.Poor Lindsay!  His mind was so taken up with, and confused by, theconstant and obtrusive presence of the Senhorina Maraquita that theparticular turn which affairs had taken had not occurred to him,although that turn was quite natural, and by no means improbable.Marizano, with Azinte on board of one of his piratical dhows, wasproceeding to the north.  Captain Romer, with his war-steamer, was onthe look-out for piratical dhows.  What more natural than that theCaptain should fall in with the pirate?  But Lieutenant Lindsay's mindhad been so filled with Maraquita that it seemed to be, for the time,incapable of holding more than one other idea--that idea was thefulfilment of Maraquita's commands to obtain information as to her lostAzinte.  To this he had of late devoted all his powers, happy in thethought that it fell in with and formed part of his duty, to his Queenand country, as well as to the "Queen of his soul."  To rescue Azintefrom Marizano seemed to the bold Lieutenant an easy enough matter; butto rescue her from his own Captain, and send her back into slavery!"Ass! that I am," he exclaimed, "not to have thought of this before.  Ofcourse she can _never_ be returned to Maraquita, and small comfort itwill be to the Senhorina to be told that her favourite is free in theSeychelles Islands, and utterly beyond her reach, unless she chooses togo there and stay with her."Overwhelmed with disgust at his own stupidity, and at the utterimpossibility of doing anything to mend matters, the unfortunateLieutenant sat down to think, and the result of his thinking was that heresolved at all events to look well after Azinte, and see that sheshould be cared for on her arrival at the Seychelles.Among the poor creatures who had been rescued from Marizano's dhow werenearly a hundred children, in such a deplorable condition that smallhopes were entertained of their reaching the island alive.  Their younglives, however, proved to be tenacious.  Experienced though their hardyrescuers were in rough and tumble work, they had no conception whatthese poor creatures had already gone through, and, therefore, formed amistaken estimate of their powers of endurance.  Eighty-three of themreached the Seychelles alive.  They were placed under the care of awarm-hearted missionary, who spared no pains for their restoration tohealth; but despite his utmost efforts, forty of these eventually died--their little frames had been whipped, and starved, and tried to such anextent, that recovery was impossible.To the care of this missionary Lieutenant Lindsay committed Azinte,telling him as much of her sad story as he was acquainted with.  Themissionary willingly took charge of her, and placed her as a nurse inthe temporary hospital which he had instituted for the little ones abovereferred to.  Here Azinte proved herself to be a most tender,affectionate, and intelligent nurse to the poor children, for whom sheappeared to entertain particular regard, and here, on the departure ofthe `Firefly' shortly afterwards, Lindsay left her in a state ofcomfort, usefulness, and comparative felicity.CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.DESCRIBES SOME OF THE DOINGS OF YOOSOOF AND HIS MEN IN PROCURING BLACKIVORY FROM THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.A dirty shop, in a filthy street in the unhealthy town of Zanzibar, isthe point to which we now beg leave to conduct our reader--whom we alsorequest to leap, in a free and easy way, over a few months of time!It is not for the sake of the shop that we make this leap, but for thepurpose of introducing the two men who, at the time we write of, satover their grog in a small back-room connected with that shop.  Stillthe shop itself is not altogether unworthy of notice.  It is what theAmericans call a store--a place where you can purchase almost everyarticle that the wants of man have called into being.  The prevailingsmells are of oil, sugar, tea, molasses, paint, and tar, a compoundwhich confuses the discriminating powers of the nose, and, on theprinciple that extremes meet, removes the feeling of surprise that oughtto be aroused by discovering that these odours are in close connexionwith haberdashery and hardware.  There are enormous casks, puncheons,and kegs on the floor; bales on the shelves; indescribable confusion inthe corners; preserved meat tins piled to the ceiling; with dust anddirt encrusting everything.  The walls, beams, and rafters, appear to beheld together by means of innumerable cobwebs.  Hosts of flies fattenon, without diminishing, the stock, and squadrons of cockroaches careerover the earthen floor.In the little back-room of this shop sat the slave-dealer Yoosoof, incompany with the captain of an English ship which lay in the harbour.Smoke from the captain's pipe filled the little den to such an extentthat Yoosoof and his friend were not so clearly distinguishable as mighthave been desired."You're all a set of false-hearted, wrong-headed, low-minded,scoundrels," said the plain-spoken captain, accompanying eachasseveration with a puff so violent as to suggest the idea that hisremarks were round-shot and his mouth a cannon.The Briton was evidently not in a complimentary mood.  It was equallyevident that Yoosoof was not in a touchy vein, for he smiled theslightest possible smile and shrugged his shoulders.  He had business totransact with the captain which was likely to result very much to hisadvantage, and Yoosoof was not the man to let feelings stand in the wayof business."Moreover," pursued the captain, in a gruff voice, "the trade in slavesis illegally conducted in one sense, namely, that it is largely carriedon by British subjects.""How you make that out?" asked Yoosoof."How? why, easy enough.  Aren't the richest men in Zanzibar the Banyans,and don't these Banyans, who number about 17,000 of your population,supply you Arabs with money to carry on the accursed slave-trade?  Andain't these Banyans Indian merchants--subjects of Great Britain?"Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders again and smiled."And don't these opulent rascals," continued the Briton, "love theirease as well as their money, and when they want to increase the latterwithout destroying the former, don't they make advances to the like ofyou and get 100 per cent out of you for every dollar advanced?"Yoosoof nodded his head decidedly at this, and smiled again."Well, then, ain't the whole lot of you a set of mean scoundrels?" saidthe captain fiercely.Yoosoof did not smile at this; he even looked for a moment as if he weregoing to resent it, but it was only for a moment.  Self-interest cameopportunely to his aid, and made him submissive."What can we do?" he asked after a short silence.  "You knows what theSultan say, other day, to one British officer, `If you stop slave-tradeyou will ruin Zanzibar.'  We mus' not do that.  Zanzibar mus' not beruin.""Why not?" demanded the captain, with a look of supreme contempt, "whatif Zanzibar _was_ ruined?  Look here, now, Yoosoof, your dirty littleisland--the whole island observe--is not quite the size of my own Scotchcounty of Lanark.  Its population is short of 250,000 all told--scarceequal to the half of the population of Lanark--composed ofsemi-barbarians and savages.  That's one side of the question.  Here'sthe other side: Africa is one of the four quarters of the earth, withmillions of vigorous niggers and millions of acres of splendid land, andno end of undeveloped resources, and you have the impudence to tell methat an enormous lump of this land must be converted into a desert, andsomething like 150,000 of its best natives be drawn off _annually_--forwhat?--for what?" repeated the sailor, bringing his fist down on thetable before him with such force that the glasses danced on it and thedust flew up; "for what?  I say; for a paltry, pitiful island, ruled bya sham sultan, without army or navy, and with little money, save what hegets by slave-dealing; an island which has no influence for good on theworld, morally, religiously, or socially, and with little commercially,though it has much influence for evil; an island which has helped thePortuguese to lock up the east coast of Africa for centuries; an islandwhich would not be missed--save as a removed curse--if it were sunk thisnight to the bottom of the sea, and all its selfish, sensual,slave-dealing population swept entirely off the face of the earth."The captain had risen and dashed his pipe to atoms on the floor in hisindignation as he made these observations.  He now made an effort tocontrol himself, and then, sitting down, he continued--"Just think,Yoosoof; you're a sharp man of business, as I know to my cost.  You canunderstand a thing in a commercial point of view.  Just try to look atit thus: On the one side of the world's account you have Zanzibar sunkwith all its Banyan and Arab population; we won't sink the niggers, poorwretches.  We'll suppose them saved, along with the consuls,missionaries, and such-like.  Well, that's a loss of somewhere about83,000 scoundrels,--a gain we might call it, but for the sake ofargument we'll call it a loss.  On the other side of the account youhave 30,000 niggers--fair average specimens of humanity--saved fromslavery, besides something like 150,000 more saved from death by war andstarvation, the results of the slave-trade; 83,000 from 150,000 leaves67,000!  The loss, you see, would be more than wiped off, and a handsomebalance left at the world's credit the very first year!  To say nothingof the opening up of legitimate commerce to one of the richest countrieson earth, and the consequent introduction of Christianity."The captain paused to take breath.  Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders, anda brief silence ensued, which was happily broken, not by a recurrence tothe question of slavery, but by the entrance of a slave.  He came insearch of Yoosoof for the purpose of telling him that his master wishedto speak with him.  As the slave's master was one of the wealthy Banyansjust referred to, Yoosoof rose at once, and, apologising to the captainfor quitting him so hurriedly, left that worthy son of Neptune to coolhis indignation in solitude.Passing through several dirty streets the slave led the slaver to abetter sort of house in a more salubrious or, rather, less pestilential,part of the town.  He was ushered into the presence of an elderly man ofquiet, unobtrusive aspect."Yoosoof," said the Banyan in Arabic, "I have been considering thematter about which we had some conversation yesterday, and I find thatit will be convenient for me to make a small venture.  I can let youhave three thousand dollars.""On the old terms?" asked Yoosoof."On the old terms," replied the merchant.  "Will you be ready to startsoon?"Yoosoof said that he would, that he had already completed the greaterpart of his preparations, and that he hoped to start for the interior ina week or two."That is well; I hope you may succeed in doing a good deal of business,"said the merchant with an amiable nod and smile, which might have led anignorant onlooker to imagine that Yoosoof's business in the interior waswork of a purely philanthropic nature!"There is another affair, which, it has struck me, may lie in your way,"continued the merchant.  "The British consul is, I am told, anxious tofind some one who will undertake to make inquiries in the interior aboutsome Englishmen, who are said to have been captured by the black fellowsand made slaves of.""Does the consul know what tribe has captured them?" asked Yoosoof."I think not; but as he offers five hundred dollars for every lost whiteman who shall be recovered and brought to the coast alive, I thoughtthat you might wish to aid him!""True," said Yoosoof, musing, "true, I will go and see him."Accordingly, the slave-dealer had an interview with the consul, duringwhich he learned that there was no absolute certainty of any Englishmenhaving been captured.  It was only a vague rumour; nevertheless it wassufficiently probable to warrant the offer of five hundred dollars toany one who should effect a rescue; therefore Yoosoof, having occasionto travel into the interior at any rate, undertook to make inquiries.He was also told that two Englishmen had, not long before, purchased anoutfit, and started off with the intention of proceeding to the interiorby way of the Zambesi river, and they, the consul said, might possiblybe heard of by him near the regions to which he was bound; but these, hesuggested, could not be the men who were reported as missing.Of course Yoosoof had not the most remote idea that these were the veryEnglishmen whom he himself had captured on the coast, for, after partingfrom them abruptly, as described in a former chapter, he had ceased tocare or think about them, and besides, was ignorant of the fact thatthey had been to Zanzibar.Yoosoof's own particular business required a rather imposing outfit.First of all, he purchased and packed about 600 pounds worth of beads ofmany colours, cloth of different kinds, thick brass wire, and a varietyof cheap trinkets, such as black men and women are fond of, for Yoosoofwas an "honest" trader, and paid his way when he found it suitable to doso.  He likewise hired a hundred men, whom he armed with guns, powder,and ball, for Yoosoof was also a dishonest trader, and fought his waywhen that course seemed most desirable.With this imposing caravan he embarked in a large dhow, sailed for thecoast landed at Kilwa, and proceeded into the interior of Africa.It was a long and toilsome journey over several hundred miles ofexceedingly fertile and beautiful country, eminently suited for thehappy abode of natives.  But Yoosoof and his class who traded in blackivory had depopulated it to such an extent that scarce a human being wasto be seen all the way.  There were plenty of villages, but they were inruins, and acres of cultivated ground with the weeds growing rank wherethe grain had once flourished.  Further on in the journey, near the endof it, there was a change; the weeds and grain grew together and didbattle, but in most places the weeds gained the victory.  It was quiteevident that the whole land had once been a rich garden teeming withhuman life--savage life, no doubt still, not so savage but that it couldmanage to exist in comparative enjoyment and multiply.  Yoosoof--passedthrough a hundred and fifty miles of this land; it was a huge grave,which, appropriately enough, was profusely garnished with human bones.[See Livingstone's _Tributaries of the Zambesi_, page 391.]At last the slave-trader reached lands which were not utterly forsaken.Entering a village one afternoon he sent a present of cloth and beads tothe chief, and, after a few preliminary ceremonies, announced that hewished to purchase slaves.The chief, who was a fine-looking young warrior, said that he had nomen, women or children to sell, except a few criminals to whom he waswelcome at a very low price,--about two or three yards of calico each.There were also one or two orphan children whose parents had diedsuddenly, and to whom no one in the village could lay claim.  It wastrue that these poor orphans had been adopted by various families whomight not wish to part with them; but no matter, the chief's command waslaw.  Yoosoof might have the orphans also for a very small sum,--a yardof calico perhaps.  But nothing would induce the chief to compel any ofhis people to part with their children, and none of the people seemeddesirous of doing so.The slave-trader therefore adopted another plan.  He soon managed toascertain that the chief had an old grudge against a neighbouring chief.In the course of conversation he artfully stirred up the slumberingill-will, and carefully fanned it into a flame without appearing to haveany such end in view.  When the iron was sufficiently hot he struck it--supplied the chief with guns and ammunition, and even, as a greatfavour, offered to lend him a few of his own men in order that he mightmake a vigorous attack on his old enemy.The device succeeded to perfection.  War was begun without any previousdeclaration; prisoners were soon brought in--not only men, but women andchildren.  The first were coupled together with heavy slave-sticks,which were riveted to their necks; the latter were attached to eachother with ropes; and thus Yoosoof, in a few days, was enabled toproceed on his journey with a goodly drove of "black cattle" behind him.This occurred not far from Lake Nyassa, which he intended should be hisheadquarters for a time, while his men, under a new leader whom heexpected to meet there, should push their victorious arms farther intothe interior.On reaching the shores of the noble lake, he found several birds of thesame feather with himself--Arabs engaged in the same trade.  He alsofound his old friend and trusty ally, Marizano.  This gratified himmuch, for he was at once enabled to hand over the charge of theexpedition to his lieutenant, and send him forth on his mission.That same evening--a lovely and comparatively cool one--Yoosoof and thehalf-caste sauntered on the margin of the lake, listening to the sweetmelody of the free and happy birds, and watching the debarkation, from alarge boat, of a band of miserable slaves who had been captured orpurchased on the other side."Now, Marizano," said Yoosoof, addressing the half-caste in his nativetongue, "I do not intend to cumber you with cloth or beads on thisexpedition.  I have already spent a good deal in the purchase of slaves,who are now in my barracoon, and I think it will be both cheaper andeasier to make up the rest of the gang by means of powder and lead.""It is lighter to carry, and more effectual," remarked Marizano, with anod of approval."True," returned Yoosoof, "and quicker.  Will a hundred men and gunssuffice?""Eighty are enough to conquer any of the bow and spear tribes of thisregion," replied the half-caste carelessly."Good!" continued Yoosoof.  "Then you shall start to-morrow.  The tribesbeyond this lake are not yet afraid of us--thanks to the mad Englishman,Livingstone, who has opened up the country and spread the informationthat white men are the friends of the black, and hate slavery."[Livingstone tells us that he found, on ascending the Shire river, thatthe Portuguese slave-traders had followed closely in the footsteps ofhis previous discoveries, and passed themselves off as his friends, bywhich means they were successful in gaining the confidence of thenatives whom they afterwards treacherously murdered or enslaved.]"You may try to pass yourself off as a white man, though your face isnot so white as might be desired; however, you can comfort yourself withthe knowledge that it is whiter than your heart!"The Arab smiled and glanced at his lieutenant.  Marizano smiled, bowedin acknowledgment of the compliment, and replied that he believedhimself to be second to no one except his employer in that respect."Well, then," continued Yoosoof, "you must follow up the discoveries ofthis Englishman; give out that you are his friend, and have come therefor the same purposes; and, when you have put them quite at their ease,commence a brisk trade with them--for which purpose you may take withyou just enough of cloth and beads to enable you to carry out thedeception.  For the rest I need not instruct; you know what to do aswell as I."Marizano approved heartily of this plan, and assured his chief that hisviews should be carried out to his entire satisfaction."But there is still another point," said Yoosoof, "on which I have totalk.  It appears that there are some white men who have been takenprisoners by one of the interior tribes--I know not which--for thefinding of whom the British consul at Zanzibar has offered me fivehundred dollars.  If you can obtain information about these men it willbe well.  If you can find and rescue them it will be still better, andyou shall have a liberal share of the reward."While the Arab was speaking, the half-caste's visage betrayed a slightdegree of surprise."White men!" he said, pulling up his sleeve and showing a gun-shot woundin his arm which appeared to be not very old.  "A white man inflictedthat not long ago, and not very far from the spot on which we stand.  Ihad vowed to take the life of that white man if we should ever chance tomeet, but if it is worth five hundred dollars I may be tempted to spareit!"He laughed lightly as he spoke, and then added, with a thoughtfullook,--"But I don't see how these men--there were two of them, if notmore--can be prisoners, because, when I came across them, they werewell-armed, well supplied, and well attended, else, you may be sure,they had not given me this wound and freed my slaves.  But thescoundrels who were with me at the time were cowards.""You are right," said Yoosoof.  "The white men you met I heard of atZanzibar.  They cannot be the prisoners we are asked to search for.They have not yet been long enough away, I should think, to have come byany mischance, and the white men who are said to be lost have beentalked about in Zanzibar for a long time.  However, make diligentinquiries, because the promise is, that the five hundred dollars shallbe ours if we rescue _any_ white man, no matter who he may chance to be.And now I shall show you the cattle I have obtained on the way up."The barracoon, to which the Arab led his lieutenant, was a spaceenclosed by a strong and high stockade, in which slaves were kept underguard until a sufficient number should be secured to form a gang,wherewith to start for the coast.  At the entrance stood asavage-looking Portuguese half-caste armed with a gun.  Inside there wasan assortment of Yoosoof's Black Ivory.  It was in comparatively goodcondition at that time, not having travelled far, and, as it wasnecessary to keep it up to a point of strength sufficient to enable itto reach the coast, it was pretty well fed except in the case of a fewrebellious articles.  There were, however, specimens of damaged goodseven there.  Several of the orphans, who had become Yoosoof's property,although sprightly enough when first purchased, had not stood even theshort journey to the lake so well as might have been expected.  They hadfallen off in flesh to such an extent that Yoosoof was induced to remarkto Marizano, as they stood surveying them, that he feared they wouldnever reach the coast alive."That one, now," he said, pointing to a little boy who was tightlywedged in the midst of the group of slaves, and sat on the ground withhis face resting on his knees, "is the most troublesome piece of goods Ihave had to do with since I began business; and it seems to me that I amgoing to lose him after all.""What's the matter with him?" asked the half-caste."Nothing particular, only he is a delicate boy.  At first I refused him,but he is so well-made, though delicate, and such a good-looking child,and so spirited, that I decided to take him; but he turns out to be_too_ spirited.  Nothing that I can do will tame him,--oh, _that_ won'tdo it," said Yoosoof, observing that Marizano raised the switch hecarried in his hand with a significant action; "I have beaten him tillthere is scarcely a sound inch of skin on his whole body, but it's of nouse.  Ho! stand up," called Yoosoof, letting the lash of his whip falllightly on the boy's shoulders.There was, however, no response; the Arab therefore repeated the order,and laid the lash across the child's bare back with a degree of forcethat would have caused the stoutest man to wince; still the boy did notmove.  Somewhat surprised, Yoosoof pushed his way towards him, seizedhim by the hair and threw back his head.The Arab left him immediately and remarked in a quiet tone that heshould have no more trouble with him--he was dead!"What's the matter with that fellow?" asked Marizano, pointing to a manwho was employed in constantly rolling up a bit of wet clay and applyingit to his left eye."Ah, he's another of these unmanageable fellows," replied Yoosoof.  "Ihave been trying to tame _him_ by starvation.  The other morning he fellon his knees before the man who guards the barracoon and entreated himto give him food.  The guard is a rough fellow, and had been put out oftemper lately by a good many of the slaves.  Instead of giving him foodhe gave him a blow in the eye which burst the ball of it, and of coursehas rendered him worthless; but _he_ won't trouble us long."In another place a woman crouched on the ground, having somethingwrapped in leaves which she pressed to her dried breast.  It was thebody of a child to which she had recently given birth in that place ofwoe.Leaving his cringing and terrified goods to the guardian of thebarracoon, the Arab returned to his tent beside the beautiful lake, andthere, while enjoying the aroma of flowers and the cool breeze, and thegenial sunshine, and the pleasant influences which God has scatteredwith bountiful hand over that luxuriant portion of the earth, calmlyconcerted with Marizano the best method by which he could bringinconceivable misery on thousands of its wretched inhabitants.CHAPTER NINETEEN.TELLS OF MISFORTUNES THAT BEFELL OUR WANDERERS; OF FAMILIAR TOYS UNDERNEW ASPECTS, ETCETERA.When Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer were stopped in theirjourney, as related in a former chapter, by the sudden illness of thebold seaman, an event was impending over them which effectuallyoverturned their plans.  This was the sudden descent of a band of armednatives who had been recently driven from their homes by a slavingparty.  The slavers had taken them by surprise during the night, settheir huts on fire, captured their women and children, and slaughteredall the men, excepting those who sought and found safety in flight.  Itwas those who had thus escaped that chanced to come upon the camp of ourtravellers one evening about sunset.Disco was recovering from his attack of fever at the time, though stillweak.  Harold was sitting by his couch of leaves in the hut which hadbeen erected for him on the first day of the illness.  Jumbo was cuttingup a piece of flesh for supper, and Antonio was putting the kettle onthe fire.  The rest of the party were away in the woods hunting.No guard was kept; consequently the savages came down on them like athunderbolt, and found them quite unprepared to resist even ifresistance had been of any use.At first their captors, bitterly infuriated by their recent losses,proposed to kill their prisoners, without delay, by means of the mostexcruciating tortures that they could invent, but from some unknowncause, changed their minds; coupled Harold and Disco together by meansof two slave-sticks; tied Antonio and Jumbo with ropes, and drove themaway.So suddenly was the thing done, and so effectually, that Disco was farfrom the camp before he could realise that what had occurred was a fact,and not one of the wild feverish dreams that had beset him during hisillness.The natives would not listen to the earnest explanation of Antonio thatHarold and Disco were Englishmen, and haters of slavery.  They scowledas they replied that the same had been said by the slavers who hadattacked their village; from which remark it would seem that Yoosoof wasnot quite the originator of that device to throw the natives off theirguard.  The Portuguese of Tette on the Zambesi had also thought of andacted on it!Fortunately it was, as we have said, near sunset when the capture wasmade, and before it became quite dark the band encamped, else must poorDisco have succumbed to weakness and fatigue.  The very desperation ofhis circumstances, however, seemed to revive his strength, for nextmorning he resumed his journey with some hope of being able to hold out.The continued protestations and assurances of Antonio, also, had theeffect of inducing their captors to remove the heavy slave-sticks fromthe necks of Harold and Disco, though they did not unbind their wrists.Thus were they led further into the country, they knew not whither, forseveral days and nights, and at last reached a large village where theywere all thrust into a hut, and left to their meditations, while theircaptors went to palaver with the chief man of the place.This chief proved to be a further-sighted man than the men of the tribewho had captured the Englishmen.  His name was Yambo.  He had heard ofDr Livingstone, and had met with men of other tribes who had seen andconversed with the great traveller.  Thus, being of a thoughtful andinquiring disposition, he had come to understand enough of the goodwhite man's sentiments to guard him from being imposed on by pretendedChristians.Yambo's name signified "how are you?" and was probably bestowed on himbecause of a strongly benevolent tendency to greet friend and strangeralike with a hearty "how d'ee do?" sort of expression of face and toneof voice.He was a tall grave man, with a commanding firm look, and, withal, adash of child-like humour and simplicity.  On hearing his visitors'remarks about their captives, he at once paid them a visit and a fewleading questions put to Harold through Antonio convinced him that theprisoners were true men.  He therefore returned to his black visitors,told them that he had perfect confidence in the good faith of the whitemen, and said that he meant to take charge of them.  He then entertainedhis black brothers hospitably, gave them a few presents, and sent themon their way.  This done he returned to his guests and told them thatthey were free, that their captors were gone, and that they might gowhere they pleased, but that it would gratify him much if they wouldconsent to spend some time hunting with him in the neighbourhood of hisvillage."Now," said Disco, after Yambo left them, "this is wot I call the mostuncommon fix that ever wos got into by man since Adam an' Eve beganhousekeepin' in the garden of Eden.""I'm not quite sure," replied Harold, with a rueful look, "that it isabsolutely the _worst_ fix, but it is bad enough.  The worst of it isthat this Yambo has let these rascals off with all our fire-arms andcamp-equipage, so that we are absolutely helpless--might as well beprisoners, for we can't quit this village in such circumstances.""Wot's wuss than that to my mind, sir, is, that here we are at sea, inthe heart of Afriky, without chart, quadrant, compass, or rudder, an' nomore idea of our whereabouts than one o' them spider monkeys that grinsamong the trees.  Hows'ever, we're in luck to fall into the hands of afriendly chief, so, like these same monkeys, we must grin an' bear it;only I can't help feelin' a bit cast down at the loss of our messmates.I fear there's no chance of their findin' us.""Not the least chance in the world, I should say," returned Harold."They could not guess in which direction we had gone, and unless theyhad hit on the right road at first, every step they took afterwardswould only widen the distance between us.""It's lucky I was beginnin' to mend before we was catched," said Disco,feeling the muscles of his legs; "true, I ain't much to boast of yet butI'm improvin'.""That is more than I can say for myself," returned Harold, with a sigh,as he passed his hand across his forehead; "I feel as if this last pushthrough the woods in the hot sun, and the weight of that terribleslave-stick had been almost too much for me."Disco looked earnestly and anxiously into the face of his friend."Wot," asked he, "does you feel?""I can scarcely tell," replied Harold, with a faint smile.  "Oh, Isuppose I'm a little knocked up, that's all.  A night's rest will put meall right.""So I thought myself, but I wos wrong," said Disco.  "Let's hear wotyour feelin's is, sir; I'm as good as any doctor now, I am, in regard tosymptoms.""Well, I feel a sort of all-overishness, a kind of lassitude andsleepiness, with a slight headache, and a dull pain which appears to becreeping up my spine.""You're in for it sir," said Disco.  "It's lucky you have always carriedthe physic in your pockets, 'cause you'll need it, an' it's lucky, too,that I am here and well enough to return tit for tat and nurse you,'cause you'll have that 'ere pain in your spine creep up your back andround your ribs till it lays hold of yer shoulders, where it'll stick asif it had made up its mind to stay there for ever an' a day.  Arter thatyou'll get cold an' shivering like ice--oh! doesn't I know it well--an'then hot as fire, with heavy head, an' swimming eyes, an' twisted sight,an' confusion of--""Hold! hold!" cried Harold, laughing, "if you go on in that way I shallhave more than my fair share of it!  Pray stop, and leave me a little tofind out for myself.""Well, sir, take a purge, and turn in at once, that's my advice.  I'lldose you with quinine to-morrow mornin', first thing," said Disco,rising and proceeding forthwith to arrange a couch in a corner of thehut, which Yambo had assigned them.Harold knew well enough that his follower was right.  He took his advicewithout delay, and next morning found himself little better than achild, both physically and mentally, for the disease not only prostratedhis great strength--as it had that of his equally robust companion--but,at a certain stage, induced delirium, during which he talked the mostineffable nonsense that his tongue could pronounce, or his brainconceive.Poor Disco, who, of course, had been unable to appreciate the extent ofhis own delirious condition, began to fear that his leader's mind wasgone for ever, and Jumbo was so depressed by the unutterably solemnexpression of the mariner's once jovial countenance, that he did notonce show his teeth for a whole week, save when engaged with meals.As for Antonio, his nature not being very sympathetic, and his healthbeing good, he rather enjoyed the quiet life and good living whichcharacterised the native village, and secretly hoped that Harold mightremain on the sick-list for a considerable time to come.How long this state of affairs lasted we cannot tell, for both Haroldand Disco lost the correct record of time during their respectiveillnesses.Up to that period they had remembered the days of the week, inconsequence of their habit of refraining from going out to hunt onSundays, except when a dearth of meat in the larder rendered hunting anecessity.  Upon these Sundays Harold's conscience sometimes reproachedhim for having set out on his journey into Africa without a Bible.  Hewhispered, to himself at first, and afterwards suggested to Disco, theexcuse that his Bible had been lost in the wreck of his father's vessel,and that, perhaps, there were no Bibles to be purchased in Zanzibar, buthis conscience was a troublesome one, and refused to tolerate such badreasoning, reminding him, reproachfully, that he had made no effortwhatever to obtain a Bible at Zanzibar.As time had passed, and some of the horrors of the slave-trade had beenbrought under his notice, many of the words of Scripture leaped to hisremembrance, and the regret that he had not carried a copy with himincreased.  That touch of thoughtlessness, so natural to the young andhealthy--to whom life has so far been only a garden of roses--wasutterly routed by the stern and dreadful realities which had beenrecently enacted around him, and just in proportion as he was impressedwith the lies, tyranny, cruelty, and falsehood of man, so did histhoughtful regard for the truth and the love of God increase, especiallythose truths that were most directly opposed to the traffic in humanflesh, such as--"love your enemies," "seek peace with all men," "bekindly affectioned one to another," "whatsoever ye would that men shoulddo unto you, do ye even so to them."  An absolute infidel, he thought,could not fail to perceive that a most blessed change would come overthe face of Africa if such principles prevailed among its inhabitants,even in an extremely moderate degree.But to return, the unfortunate travellers were now "at sea" altogetherin regard to the Sabbath as well as the day of the month.  Indeed theirminds were not very clear as to the month itself!"Hows'ever," said Disco, when this subject afterwards came to bediscussed, "it don't matter much.  Wot is it that the Scriptur'says,--`Six days shalt thou labour an' do all that thou hast to do, butthe seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.  In it thou shalt dono work.'  I wos used always to stick at that pint w'en my poor motherwas a-teachin' of me.  Never got past it.  But it's enough for presentuse anyhow, for the orders is, work six days an' don't work the seventh.Werry good, we'll begin to-day an' call it Monday; we'll work for sixdays, an' w'en the seventh day comes we'll call it Sunday.  If it ain'tthe right day, _we_ can't help it; moreover, wot's the odds?  It's the_seventh_ day, so that to us it'll be the Sabbath."But we anticipate.  Harold was still--at the beginning of thisdigression--in the delirium of fever, though there were symptoms ofimprovement about him.One afternoon one of these symptoms was strongly manifested in a long,profound slumber.  While he slept Disco sat on a low stool beside him,busily engaged with a clasp-knife on some species of manufacture, thenature of which was not apparent at a glance.His admirer, Jumbo, was seated on a stool opposite, gazing at himopen-mouthed, with a countenance that reflected every passing feeling ofhis dusky bosom.Both men were so deeply absorbed in their occupation--Disco in hismanufacture, and Jumbo in staring at Disco--that they failed for aconsiderable time to observe that Harold had wakened suddenly, thoughquietly, and was gazing at them with a look of lazy, easy-goingsurprise.The mariner kept up a running commentary on his work, addressed to Jumboindeed, but in a quiet interjectional manner that seemed to imply thathe was merely soliloquising, and did not want or expect a reply."It's the most 'stror'nary notion, Jumbo, between you and me and thepost, that I ever did see.  Now, then, this here bullet-head wants apair o' eyes an' a nose on it; the mouth'll do, but it's the mouth as ismost troublesome, for you niggers have got such wappin' muzzles--it'squite a caution, as the Yankees say,"--(a pause)--"on the whole,however, the nose is very difficult to manage on a flat surface, 'causew'y?--if I leaves it quite flat, it don't look like a nose, an' if Icarves it out ever so little, it's too prominent for a nigger nose.There, ain't that a good head, Jumbo?"Thus directly appealed to, Jumbo nodded his own head violently, andshowed his magnificent teeth from ear to ear, gums included.Disco laid down the flat piece of board which he had carved into theform of a human head, and took up another piece, which was rudelyblocked out into the form of a human leg--both leg and head being aslarge as life."Now this limb, Jumbo," continued Disco, slowly, as he whittled awaywith the clasp-knife vigorously, "is much more troublesome than I wouldhave expected; for you niggers have got such abominably ill-shaped legsbelow the knee.  There's such an unnat'ral bend for'ard o' theshin-bone, an' such a rediklous sticking out o' the heel astarn, d'eesee, that a feller with white man notions has to make a study of it, ifhe sets up for a artist; in course, if he _don't_ set up for a artistany sort o' shape'll do, for it don't affect the jumpin'.  Ha! therethey go," he exclaimed, with a humorous smile at a hearty shout oflaughter which was heard just outside the hut, "enjoyin' the old 'un;but it's nothin' to wot the noo 'un'll be w'en it's finished."At this exhibition of amusement on the countenance of his friend, Jumbothrew back his head and again showed not only his teeth and gums but theentire inside of his mouth, and chuckled softly from the region of hisbreast-bone."I'm dreaming, of course," thought Harold, and shut his eyes.Poor fellow! he was very weak, and the mere act of shutting his eyesinduced a half-slumber.  He awoke again in a few minutes, and re-openinghis eyes, beheld the two men still sitting, and occupied as before."It is a wonderfully pertinacious dream," thought Harold.  "I'll try todissipate it."Thinking thus, he called out aloud,--"I say, Disco!""Hallo! that's uncommon like the old tones," exclaimed the seaman,dropping his knife and the leg of wood as he looked anxiously at hisfriend."What old tones?" asked Harold."The tones of your voice," said Disco."Have they changed so much of late?" inquired Harold in surprise."Have they?  I should think they have, just.  W'y, you haven't spokelike that, sir, for--but, surely--are you better, or is this on'yanother dodge o' yer madness?" asked Disco with a troubled look."Ah!  I suppose I've been delirious, have I?" said Harold with a faintsmile.To this Disco replied that he had not only been delirious, but starkstaring mad, and expressed a very earnest hope that, now he had got hissenses hauled taut again, he'd belay them an' make all fast for, if hedidn't, it was his, Disco's opinion, that another breeze o' the samekind would blow 'em all to ribbons."Moreover," continued Disco, firmly, "you're not to talk.  I once nurseda messmate through a fever, an' I remember that the doctor wos werrypartikler w'en he began to come round, in orderin' him to hold histongue an' keep quiet.""You are right Disco.  I will keep quiet, but you must first tell mewhat you are about, for it has roused my curiosity, and I can't resttill I know.""Well, sir, I'll tell you, but don't go for to make no obsarvations onit.  Just keep your mouth shut an' yer ears open, an' I'll do all thejawin'.  Well, you must know, soon after you wos took bad, I felt as ifI'd like some sort o' okipation w'en sittin' here watchin' of you--Jumboan' me's bin takin' the watch time about, for Antony isn't able to holda boy, much less _you_ w'en you gits obstropolous--Well, sir, I had tooka sort o' fancy for Yambo's youngest boy, for he's a fine, brave littleshaver, he is, an' I thought I'd make him some sort o' toy, an' itstruck me that the thing as 'ud please him most 'ud be a jumpin'-jack,so I set to an' made him one about a futt high."You never see such a face o' joy as that youngster put on, sir, w'en Itook it to him an' pulled the string.  He give a little squeak ofdelight he did, tuk it in his hands, an' ran home to show it to hismother.  Well, sir, wot d'ee think, the poor boy come back soon after,blubberin' an' sobbin', as nat'ral as if he'd bin an English boy, an'says he to Tony, says he, `Father's bin an' took it away from me!'  Iwos surprised at this, an' went right off to see about it, an' w'en Icome to Yambo's hut wot does I see but the chief pullin' the string o'the jumpin'-jack, an' grinnin' an' sniggerin' like a blue-faced baboonin a passion--his wife likewise standin' by holdin' her sides wi'laughin'.  Well, sir, the moment I goes in, up gits the chief an' shoutsfor Tony, an' tells him to tell me that I must make him a jumpin'-jack!In course I says I'd do it with all the pleasure in life; and he saysthat I must make it full size, as big as hisself!  I opened my eyes atthis, but he said he must have a thing that was fit for a man--a chief--so there was nothin' for it but to set to work.  An' it worn't difficultto manage neither, for they supplied me with slabs o' timber an inchthick an' I soon blocked out the body an' limbs with a hatchet an'polished 'em off with my knife, and then put 'em together.  W'en the bigjack wos all right Yambo took it away, for he'd watched me all the timeI wos at it, an' fixed it up to the branch of a tree an' set to work."I never, no I never, did," continued Disco, slapping his right thigh,while Jumbo grinned in sympathy, "see sitch a big baby as Yambo becamew'en he got that monstrous jumpin'-jack into action--with his courtiersall round him, their faces blazin' with surprise, or conwulsed wi'laughter.  The chief hisself was too hard at work to laugh much.  Hecould only glare an' grin, for, big an' strong though he is, the jackwos so awful heavy that it took all his weight an' muscle haulin' on therope which okipied the place o' the string that we're used to."`Haul away, my hearty,' thought I, w'en I seed him heavin', blowin',an' swettin' at the jack's halyards, `you'll not break that rope in ahurry.'"But I was wrong, sir, for, although the halyards held on all right, Ihad not calkilated on such wiolent action at the joints.  All of asudden off comes a leg at the knee.  It was goin' the up'ard kick at thetime, an' went up like a rocket, slap through a troop o' monkeys thatwas lookin' on aloft, which it scattered like foam in a gale.  Yambodidn't seem to care a pinch o' snuff.  His blood was up.  The sweat wasrunnin' off him like rain.  `Hi!' cries he, givin' another most awfultug.  But it wasn't high that time, for the other leg came off at thehip-jint on the down kick, an' went straight into the buzzum of a blackwarrior an' floored him wuss than he ever wos floored since he took tofightin'.  Yambo didn't care for that either.  He gave another haul withall his might, which proved too much for jack without his legs, for itthrew his arms out with such force that they jammed hard an' fast, as ifthe poor critter was howlin' for mercy!"Yambo looked awful blank at this.  Then he turned sharp round andlooked at me for all the world as if he meant to say `wot d'ee mean bythat? eh!'"`He shouldn't ought to lick into him like that,' says I to Tony, `thefigure ain't made to be druv by a six-horse power steam-engine!  Buttell him I'll fix it up with jints that'll stand pullin' by an elephant,and I'll make him another jack to the full as big as that one an' twiceas strong.'"This," added Disco in conclusion, taking up the head on which he hadbeen engaged, "is the noo jack.  The old un's outside working away atthis moment like a win'-mill.  Listen; don't 'ee hear 'em?"Harold listened and found no difficulty in hearing them, for peals oflaughter and shrieks of delight burst forth every few minutes,apparently from a vast crowd outside the hut."I do believe," said Disco, rising and going towards the door of the hut"that you can see 'em from where you lay."He drew aside the skin doorway as he spoke, and there, sure enough, wasthe gigantic jumping-jack hanging from the limb of a tree, clearlydefined against the sky, and galvanically kicking about its vast limbs,with Yambo pulling fiercely at the tail, and the entire tribe looking onsteeped in ecstasy and admiration.It may easily be believed that the sight of this, coupled with Disco'snarrative, was almost too much for Harold's nerves, and for some time heexhibited, to Disco's horror, a tendency to repeat some antics whichwould have been much more appropriate to the jumping-jack, but, after awarm drink administered by his faithful though rough nurse, he becamecomposed, and finally dropped into a pleasant sleep, which was notbroken till late the following morning.Refreshed in body, happy in mind, and thankful in spirit he rose to feelthat the illness against which he had fought for many days wasconquered, and that, although still very weak, he had fairly turned thecorner, and had begun to regain some of his wonted health and vigour.CHAPTER TWENTY.HAROLD APPEARS IN A NEW CHARACTER, AND TWO OLD CHARACTERS REAPPEAR TOHAROLD.The mind of Yambo was a strange compound--a curious mixture of gravityand rollicking joviality; at one time displaying a phase of intensesolemnity; at another exhibiting quiet pleasantry and humour, butearnestness was the prevailing trait of his character.  Whetherindulging his passionate fondness for the jumping-jack, or engaged inguiding the deliberations of his counsellors, the earnest chief wasequally devoted to the work in hand.  Being a savage--and, consequently,led entirely by feeling, which is perhaps the chief characteristic ofsavage, as distinguished from civilised, man,--he hated his enemies withexceeding bitterness, and loved his friends with all his heart.Yambo was very tender to Harold during his illness, and the latter feltcorresponding gratitude, so that there sprang up between the two acloser friendship than one could have supposed to be possible,considering that they were so different from each other, mentally,physically, and socially, and that their only mode of exchanging ideaswas through the medium of a very incompetent interpreter.Among other things Harold discovered that his friend the chief wasextremely fond of anecdotes and stories.  He, therefore, while in aconvalescent state and unable for much physical exercise, amusedhimself, and spent much of his time, in narrating to him the adventuresof Robinson Crusoe.  Yambo's appetite for mental food increased, andwhen Crusoe's tale was finished he eagerly demanded more.  Some of hiswarriors also came to hear, and at last the hut was unable to containthe audiences that wished to enter.  Harold, therefore, removed to anopen space under a banyan-tree, and there daily, for several hours,related all the tales and narratives with which he was acquainted, tothe hundreds of open-eyed and open-mouthed negroes who squatted aroundhim.At first he selected such tales as he thought would be likely to amuse,but these being soon exhausted, he told them about anything that chancedto recur to his memory.  Then, finding that their power to swallow themarvellous was somewhat crocodilish, he gave them Jack the Giant-killer,and Jack of Beanstalk notoriety, and Tom Thumb, Cinderella, etcetera,until his entire nursery stock was exhausted, after which he fell backon his inventive powers; but the labour of this last effort proving veryconsiderable, and the results not being adequately great, he took tohistory, and told them stories about William Tell, and Wallace, andBruce, and the Puritans of England, and the Scottish Covenanters, andthe discoveries of Columbus, until the eyes and mouths of his blackauditors were held so constantly and widely on the stretch, that Discobegan to fear they would become gradually incapable of being shut, andhe entertained a fear that poor Antonio's tongue would, ere long, bedried up at the roots.At last a thought occurred to our hero, which he promulgated to Discoone morning as they were seated at breakfast on the floor of their hut."It seems to me, Disco," he said, after a prolonged silence, duringwhich they had been busily engaged with their knives and wooden spoons,"that illness must be sent sometimes, to teach men that they give toolittle of their thoughts to the future world.""Werry true, sir," replied Disco, in that quiet matter-of-course tonewith which men generally receive axiomatic verities; "we _is_ raithergiven to be swallered up with this world, which ain't surprisin'neither, seein' that we've bin putt into it, and are surrounded by it,mixed up with it, steeped in it, so to speak, an' can't werry well helpourselves.""That last is just the point I'm not quite so sure about," rejoinedHarold.  "Since I've been lying ill here, I have thought a good dealabout forgetting to bring a Bible with me, and about the meaning of theterm Christian, which name I bear; and yet I can't, when I look honestlyat it, see that I do much to deserve the name.""Well, I don't quite see that, sir," said Disco, with an argumentativecurl of his right eyebrow; "you doesn't swear, or drink, or steal, orcommit murder, an' a many other things o' that sort.  Ain't that theresult o' your being a Christian.""It may be so, Disco, but that is only what may be styled the _don't_side of the question.  What troubles me is, that I don't see much on the_do_ side of it.""You says your prayers, sir, don't you?" asked Disco, with the air of aman who had put a telling question."Well, yes," replied Harold; "but what troubles me is that, while in mycreed I profess to think the salvation of souls is of such vitalimportance, in my practice I seem to say that it is of no importance atall, for here have I been, for many weeks, amongst these black fellows,and have never so much as mentioned the name of our Saviour to them,although I have been telling them no end of stories of all kinds, bothtrue and fanciful.""There's something in that sir," admitted Disco.  Harold also thoughtthere was so much in it that he gave the subject a great deal of earnestconsideration, and finally resolved to begin to tell the negroes Biblestories.  He was thus gradually led to tell them that "old, old story"of God the Saviour's life and death, and love for man, which he foundinterested, affected, and influenced the savages far more powerfullythan any of the tales, whether true or fanciful, with which he hadpreviously entertained them.  While doing this a new spirit seemed toactuate himself, and to influence his whole being.While Harold was thus led, almost unconsciously, to become a sower ofthe blessed seed of God's Word, Marizano was working his way through thecountry, setting forth, in the most extreme manner, the ultimate resultsof man's sinful nature, and the devil's lies.One of his first deeds was to visit a village which was beautifullysituated on the banks of a small but deep river.  In order to avoidalarming the inhabitants, he approached it with only about thirty of hismen, twenty of whom were armed.  Arrived at the outskirts, he halted hisarmed men, and advanced with the other ten, calling out cheerfully, "Wehave things for sale! have you anything to sell?"  The chief and hiswarriors, armed with their bows and arrows and shields, met him, andforbade him to pass within the hedge that encircled the village, buttold him to sit down under a tree outside.  A mat of split reeds wasplaced for Marizano to sit on; and when he had explained to the chiefthat the object of his visit was to trade with him for ivory--in proofof which he pointed to the bales which his men carried,--he was wellreceived, and a great clapping of hands ensued.  Presents were thenexchanged, and more clapping of hands took place, for this wasconsidered the appropriate ceremony.  The chief and his warriors, onsitting down before Marizano and his men, clapped their hands together,and continued slapping on their thighs while handing their presents, orwhen receiving those of their visitors.  It was the African "thank you."To have omitted it would have been considered very bad manners.Soon a brisk trade was commenced, in which the entire community becameere long deeply and eagerly absorbed.Meanwhile Marizano's armed men were allowed to come forward.  The womenprepared food for the strangers; and after they had eaten and drunk ofthe native beer heartily, Marizano asked the chief if he had ever seenfire-arms used."Yes," replied the chief, "but only once at a great distance off.  It istold to me that your guns kill very far off--much further than our bows.Is that so?""It is true," replied Marizano, who was very merry by this time underthe influence of the beer, as, indeed, were also his men and theirentertainers.  "Would you like to see what our guns can do?" asked thehalf-caste.  "If you will permit me, I shall let you hear and see themin use."The unsuspecting chief at once gave his consent.  His visitors rose;Marizano gave the word; a volley was poured forth which instantly killedthe chief and twenty of his men.  The survivors fled in horror.  Theyoung women and children were seized; the village was sacked--whichmeans that the old and useless members of the community were murdered incold blood, and the place was set on fire--and Marizano marched awaywith his band of captives considerably augmented, leaving a scene ofdeath and horrible desolation behind him.  [See Livingstone's _Zambesiand its Tributaries_, pages 201, 202.]Thus did that villain walk through the land with fire and swordprocuring slaves for the supply of the "domestic institution" of theSultan of Zanzibar.By degrees the murderer's drove of black "cattle" increased to such anextent that when he approached the neighbourhood of the village in whichHarold and Disco sojourned, he began to think that he had obtained aboutas many as he could conveniently manage, and meditated turning his faceeastward, little dreaming how near he was to a thousand dollars' worthof property, in the shape of ransom for two white men!He was on the point of turning back and missing this when he chanced tofall in with a villager who was out hunting, and who, after a hot chase,was captured.  This man was made much of, and presented with some yardsof cloth as well as a few beads, at the same time being assured that hehad nothing to fear; that the party was merely a slave-trading one; thatthe number of slaves required had been made up, but that a few morewould be purchased if the chief of his village had any to dispose of.On learning from the man that his village was a large one, fully twodays' march from the spot where he stood, and filled with armed men,Marizano came to the conclusion that it would not be worth his while toproceed thither, and was about to order his informant to be added to hisgang with a slave-stick round his neck, when he suddenly bethought himof inquiring as to whether any white men had been seen in these parts.As he had often made the same inquiry before without obtaining anysatisfactory answer, it was with great surprise that he now heard fromhis captive of two white men being in the very village about which hehad been conversing.At once he changed his plan, resumed his march, and, a couple of daysafterwards, presented himself before the astonished eyes of HaroldSeadrift and Disco Lillihammer, while they were taking a walk about amile from the village.Disco recognised the slave-trader at once, and, from the troubled aswell as surprised look of Marizano, it was pretty evident that heremembered the countenance of Disco.When the recollection of Marizano's cruelty at the time of their firstmeeting flashed upon him, Disco felt an almost irresistible desire torush upon and strangle the Portuguese, but the calm deportment of thatwily man, and the peaceful manner in which he had approached, partlydisarmed his wrath.  He could not however, quite restrain his tongue."Ha!" said he, "you are the blackguard that we met and pretty nigh shotwhen we first came to these parts, eh?  Pity we missed you, youblack-hearted villain!"As Marizano did not understand English, these complimentary remarks werelost on him.  He seemed, however, to comprehend the drift of them, forhe returned Disco's frown with a stare of defiance."Whatever he was, or whatever he is," interposed Harold, "we mustrestrain ourselves just now, Disco, because we cannot punish him as hedeserves, however much we may wish to, and he seems to have armed menenough to put us and our entertainers completely in his power.  Keepquiet while I speak to him."Jumbo and Antonio, armed with bows and arrows,--for they were in searchof small game wherewith to supply the pot--came up, looking very muchsurprised, and the latter a good deal frightened."Ask him, Antonio," said Harold, "what is his object in visiting thispart of the country.""To procure slaves," said Marizano, curtly."I thought so," returned Harold; "but he will find that the men of thistribe are not easily overcome.""I do not wish to overcome them," said the half-caste.  "I have procuredenough of slaves, as you see," (pointing to the gang which was haltedsome hundred yards or so in rear of his armed men), "but I heard thatyou were prisoners here, and I have come to prove to you that even aslave-trader can return good for evil.  _You_ did this," he said,looking at Disco, and pointing to his old wound in the arm; "I now cometo deliver you from slavery."Having suppressed part of the truth, and supplemented the rest of itwith this magnificent lie, Marizano endeavoured to look magnanimous."I don't believe a word of it," said Disco, decidedly."I incline to doubt it too," said Harold; "but he may have some goodreason of his own for his friendly professions towards us.  In any casewe have no resource left but to assume that he speaks the truth."Turning to Marizano, he said:--"We are not prisoners here.  We are guests of the chief of thisvillage.""In that case," replied the half-caste, "I can return to the coastwithout you."As he said this a large band of the villagers, having discovered thatstrangers had arrived, drew near.  Marizano at once advanced, makingpeaceful demonstrations, and, after the requisite amount of clapping ofhands on both sides, stated the object for which he had come.  He madeno attempt to conceal the fact that he was a slave-trader, but saidthat, having purchased enough of slaves, he had visited their villagebecause of certain rumours to the effect that some white men had beenlost in these regions, and could not find their way back to the coast.He was anxious, he said, to help these white men to do so, but, findingthat the white men then at the village were _not_ the men he was insearch of, and did not want to go to the coast, he would just stay longenough with the chief to exchange compliments, and then depart.All this was translated to the white men in question by their faithfulally Antonio, and when they retired to consult as to what should bedone, they looked at each other with half amused and half perplexedexpressions of countenance."Werry odd," said Disco, "how contrairy things turns up at times!""Very odd indeed," assented Harold, laughing.  "It is quite true that weare, in one sense, lost and utterly unable to undertake a journeythrough this country without men, means, or arms; and nothing could bemore fortunate than that we should have the chance, thus suddenly thrownin our way, of travelling under the escort of a band of armed men;nevertheless, I cannot bear the idea of travelling with or beingindebted to a slave-trader and a scoundrel like Marizano.""That's w'ere it is, sir," said Disco with emphasis, "I could standanything a'most but that.""And yet," pursued Harold, "it is our only chance.  I see quite wellthat we may remain for years here without again having such anopportunity or such an escort thrown in our way.""There's no help for it, I fear," said Disco.  "We must take it like adose o' nasty physic--hold our nobs, shut our daylights, an' down withit.  The only thing I ain't sure of is your ability to travel.  Youain't strong yet.""Oh, I'm strong enough now, or very nearly so, and getting strongerevery day.  Well, then, I suppose it's settled that we go?""Humph!  I'm agreeable, an' the whole business werry disagreeable," saidDisco, making a wry face.Marizano was much pleased when the decision of the white men was madeknown to him, and the native chief was naturally much distressed, for,not only was he about to lose two men of whom he had become very fond,but he was on the point of being bereft of his story-teller, the openerup of his mind, the man who, above all others, had taught him to thinkabout his Maker and a future state.He had sense enough, however, to perceive that his guests could notchoose but avail themselves of so good an opportunity, and, after thefirst feeling of regret was over, made up his mind to the separation.Next day Harold and Disco, with feelings of strong revulsion, almost ofshame, fell into the ranks of the slave-gang, and for many daysthereafter marched through the land in company with Marizano and hisband of lawless villains.Marizano usually walked some distance ahead of the main body with a fewtrusty comrades.  Our adventurers, with their two followers, came nextin order of march, the gang of slaves in single file followed, and thearmed men brought up t
