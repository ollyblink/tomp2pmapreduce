His estimate ofthe bequest was far from overweening; to few men could the smallsum-total of his activities in this world seem more inconsiderablethan, in those last solemn days, it did to him.  He had burnt much;found much unworthy; looking steadfastly into the silent continents ofDeath and Eternity, a brave man's judgments about his own sorry workin the field of Time are not apt to be too lenient.  But, in fine,here was some portion of his work which the world had already got holdof, and which he could not burn.  This too, since it was not to beabolished and annihilated, but must still for some time live and act,he wished to be wisely settled, as the rest had been.  And so it wasleft in charge to us, the survivors, to do for it what we judgedfittest, if indeed doing nothing did not seem the fittest to us.  Thismessage, communicated after his decease, was naturally a sacred one toMr. Hare and me.After some consultation on it, and survey of the difficulties anddelicate considerations involved in it, Archdeacon Hare and I agreedthat the whole task, of selecting what Writings were to be reprinted,and of drawing up a Biography to introduce them, should be left to himalone; and done without interference of mine:--as accordingly itwas,[1] in a manner surely far superior to the common, in every good qualityof editing; and visibly everywhere bearing testimony to thefriendliness, the piety, perspicacity and other gifts and virtues ofthat eminent and amiable man.In one respect, however, if in one only, the arrangement had beenunfortunate.  Archdeacon Hare, both by natural tendency and by hisposition as a Churchman, had been led, in editing a Work not free fromecclesiastical heresies, and especially in writing a Life very full ofsuch, to dwell with preponderating emphasis on that part of hissubject; by no means extenuating the fact, nor yet passing lightlyover it (which a layman could have done) as needing no extenuation;but carefully searching into it, with the view of excusing andexplaining it; dwelling on it, presenting all the documents of it, andas it were spreading it over the whole field of his delineation; as ifreligious heterodoxy had been the grand fact of Sterling's life, whicheven to the Archdeacon's mind it could by no means seem to be.  _Hincillae lachrymae_.  For the Religious Newspapers, and PeriodicalHeresy-hunters, getting very lively in those years, were prompt toseize the cue; and have prosecuted and perhaps still prosecute it, intheir sad way, to all lengths and breadths.  John Sterling's characterand writings, which had little business to be spoken of in anyChurch-court, have hereby been carried thither as if for an exclusivetrial; and the mournfulest set of pleadings, out of which nothing buta misjudgment _can_ be formed, prevail there ever since.  The nobleSterling, a radiant child of the empyrean, clad in bright auroral huesin the memory of all that knew him,--what is he doing here ininquisitorial _sanbenito_, with nothing but ghastly spectralitiesprowling round him, and inarticulately screeching and gibbering whatthey call their judgment on him!"The sin of Hare's Book," says one of my Correspondents in thoseyears, "is easily defined, and not very condemnable, but it isnevertheless ruinous to his task as Biographer.  He takes up Sterlingas a clergyman merely.  Sterling, I find, was a curate for exactlyeight months; during eight months and no more had he any specialrelation to the Church.  But he was a man, and had relation to theUniverse, for eight-and-thirty years:  and it is in this lattercharacter, to which all the others were but features and transitoryhues, that we wish to know him.  His battle with hereditary Churchformulas was severe; but it was by no means his one battle with thingsinherited, nor indeed his chief battle; neither, according to myobservation of what it was, is it successfully delineated or summed upin this Book.  The truth is, nobody that had known Sterling wouldrecognize a feature of him here; you would never dream that this Booktreated of _him_ at all.  A pale sickly shadow in torn surplice ispresented to us here; weltering bewildered amid heaps of what you call'Hebrew Old-clothes;' wrestling, with impotent impetuosity, to freeitself from the baleful imbroglio, as if that had been its onefunction in life:  who in this miserable figure would recognize thebrilliant, beautiful and cheerful John Sterling, with his ever-flowingwealth of ideas, fancies, imaginations; with his frank affections,inexhaustible hopes, audacities, activities, and general radiantvivacity of heart and intelligence, which made the presence of him anillumination and inspiration wherever he went?  It is too bad.  Let aman be honestly forgotten when his life ends; but let him not bemisremembered in this way.  To be hung up as an ecclesiasticalscarecrow, as a target for heterodox and orthodox to practice archeryupon, is no fate that can be due to the memory of Sterling.  It wasnot as a ghastly phantasm, choked in Thirty-nine-articlecontroversies, or miserable Semitic, Anti-Semitic street-riots,--inscepticisms, agonized self-seekings, that this man appeared in life;nor as such, if the world still wishes to look at him should yousuffer the world's memory of him now to be.  Once for all, it isunjust; emphatically untrue as an image of John Sterling:  perhaps tofew men that lived along with him could such an interpretation oftheir existence be more inapplicable."Whatever truth there might be in these rather passionaterepresentations, and to myself there wanted not a painful feeling oftheir truth, it by no means appeared what help or remedy any friend ofSterling's, and especially one so related to the matter as myself,could attempt in the interim.  Perhaps endure in patience till thedust laid itself again, as all dust does if you leave it well alone?Much obscuration would thus of its own accord fall away; and, in Mr.Hare's narrative itself, apart from his commentary, many features ofSterling's true character would become decipherable to such as soughtthem.  Censure, blame of this Work of Mr. Hare's was naturally farfrom my thoughts.  A work which distinguishes itself by human pietyand candid intelligence; which, in all details, is careful, lucid,exact; and which offers, as we say, to the observant reader that willinterpret facts, many traits of Sterling besides his heterodoxy.Censure of it, from me especially, is not the thing due; from me a farother thing is due!--On the whole, my private thought was:  First, How happy itcomparatively is, for a man of any earnestness of life, to have noBiography written of him; but to return silently, with his small,sorely foiled bit of work, to the Supreme Silences, who alone canjudge of it or him; and not to trouble the reviewers, and greater orlesser public, with attempting to judge it!  The idea of "fame," asthey call it, posthumous or other, does not inspire one with muchecstasy in these points of view.--Secondly, That Sterling'sperformance and real or seeming importance in this world was actuallynot of a kind to demand an express Biography, even according to theworld's usages.  His character was not supremely original; neither washis fate in the world wonderful.  What he did was inconsiderableenough; and as to what it lay in him to have done, this was but aproblem, now beyond possibility of settlement.  Why had a Biographybeen inflicted on this man; why had not No-biography, and theprivilege of all the weary, been his lot?--Thirdly, That such lot,however, could now no longer be my good Sterling's; a tumult havingrisen around his name, enough to impress some pretended likeness ofhim (about as like as the Guy-Fauxes are, on Gunpowder-Day) upon theminds of many men:  so that he could not be forgotten, and could onlybe misremembered, as matters now stood.Whereupon, as practical conclusion to the whole, arose by degrees thisfinal thought, That, at some calmer season, when the theological dusthad well fallen, and both the matter itself, and my feelings on it,were in a suitabler condition, I ought to give my testimony about thisfriend whom I had known so well, and record clearly what my knowledgeof him was.  This has ever since seemed a kind of duty I had to do inthe world before leaving it.And so, having on my hands some leisure at this time, and being boundto it by evident considerations, one of which ought to be especiallysacred to me, I decide to fling down on paper some outline of what myrecollections and reflections contain in reference to this mostfriendly, bright and beautiful human soul; who walked with me for aseason in this world, and remains to me very memorable while Icontinue in it.  Gradually, if facts simple enough in themselves canbe narrated as they came to pass, it will be seen what kind of manthis was; to what extent condemnable for imaginary heresy and othercrimes, to what extent laudable and lovable for noble manful_orthodoxy_ and other virtues;--and whether the lesson his life had toteach us is not much the reverse of what the Religious Newspapershitherto educe from it.Certainly it was not as a "sceptic" that you could define him,whatever his definition might be.  Belief, not doubt, attended him atall points of his progress; rather a tendency to too hasty andheadlong belief.  Of all men he was the least prone to what you couldcall scepticism:  diseased self-listenings, self-questionings,impotently painful dubitations, all this fatal nosology of spiritualmaladies, so rife in our day, was eminently foreign to him.  Quite onthe other side lay Sterling's faults, such as they were.  In fact, youcould observe, in spite of his sleepless intellectual vivacity, he wasnot properly a thinker at all; his faculties were of the active, notof the passive or contemplative sort.  A brilliant _improvisatore_;rapid in thought, in word and in act; everywhere the promptest andleast hesitating of men.  I likened him often, in my banterings, tosheet-lightning; and reproachfully prayed that he would concentratehimself into a bolt, and rive the mountain-barriers for us, instead ofmerely playing on them and irradiating them.True, he had his "religion" to seek, and painfully shape together forhimself, out of the abysses of conflicting disbelief and sham-beliefand bedlam delusion, now filling the world, as all men of reflectionhave; and in this respect too,--more especially as his lot in thebattle appointed for us all was, if you can understand it, victory andnot defeat,--he is an expressive emblem of his time, and aninstruction and possession to his contemporaries.  For, I say, it isby no means as a vanquished _doubter_ that he figures in the memory ofthose who knew him; but rather as a victorious _believer_, and undergreat difficulties a victorious doer.  An example to us all, not oflamed misery, helpless spiritual bewilderment and sprawling despair,or any kind of _drownage_ in the foul welter of our so-calledreligious or other controversies and confusions; but of a swift andvaliant vanquisher of all these; a noble asserter of himself, asworker and speaker, in spite of all these.  Continually, so far as hewent, he was a teacher, by act and word, of hope, clearness, activity,veracity, and human courage and nobleness:  the preacher of a goodgospel to all men, not of a bad to any man.  The man, whether inpriest's cassock or other costume of men, who is the enemy or hater ofJohn Sterling, may assure himself that he does not yet know him,--thatmiserable differences of mere costume and dialect still divide him,whatsoever is worthy, catholic and perennial in him, from a brothersoul who, more than most in his day, was his brother and not hisadversary in regard to all that.Nor shall the irremediable drawback that Sterling was not current inthe Newspapers, that he achieved neither what the world callsgreatness nor what intrinsically is such, altogether discourage me.What his natural size, and natural and accidental limits were, willgradually appear, if my sketching be successful.  And I have remarkedthat a true delineation of the smallest man, and his scene ofpilgrimage through life, is capable of interesting the greatest man;that all men are to an unspeakable degree brothers, each man's life astrange emblem of every man's; and that Human Portraits, faithfullydrawn, are of all pictures the welcomest on human walls.  Monitionsand moralities enough may lie in this small Work, if honestly writtenand honestly read;--and, in particular, if any image of John Sterlingand his Pilgrimage through our poor Nineteenth Century be one daywanted by the world, and they can find some shadow of a true imagehere, my swift scribbling (which shall be very swift and immediate)may prove useful by and by.CHAPTER II.BIRTH AND PARENTAGE.John Sterling was born at Kaimes Castle, a kind of dilapidatedbaronial residence to which a small farm was then attached, rented byhis Father, in the Isle of Bute,--on the 20th July, 1806.  Both hisparents were Irish by birth, Scotch by extraction; and became, as hehimself did, essentially English by long residence and habit.  Of Johnhimself Scotland has little or nothing to claim except the birth andgenealogy, for he left it almost before the years of memory; and inhis mature days regarded it, if with a little more recognition andintelligence, yet without more participation in any of its accentsoutward or inward, than others natives of Middlesex or Surrey, wherethe scene of his chief education lay.The climate of Bute is rainy, soft of temperature; with skies ofunusual depth and brilliancy, while the weather is fair.  In that softrainy climate, on that wild-wooded rocky coast, with its gnarledmountains and green silent valleys, with its seething rain-storms andmany-sounding seas, was young Sterling ushered into his firstschooling in this world.  I remember one little anecdote his Fathertold me of those first years:  One of the cows had calved; young John,still in petticoats, was permitted to go, holding by his father'shand, and look at the newly arrived calf; a mystery which he surveyedwith open intent eyes, and the silent exercise of all the scientificfaculties he had;--very strange mystery indeed, this new arrival, andfresh denizen of our Universe:  "Wull't eat a-body?" said John in hisfirst practical Scotch, inquiring into the tendencies this mysterymight have to fall upon a little fellow and consume him as provision:"Will it eat one, Father?"--Poor little open-eyed John:  the familylong bantered him with this anecdote; and we, in far other years,laughed heartily on hearing it.--Simple peasant laborers, ploughers,house-servants, occasional fisher-people too; and the sight of ships,and crops, and Nature's doings where Art has little meddled with her:this was the kind of schooling our young friend had, first of all; onthis bench of the grand world-school did he sit, for the first fouryears of his life.Edward Sterling his Father, a man who subsequently came toconsiderable notice in the world, was originally of Waterford inMunster; son of the Episcopalian Clergyman there; and chiefrepresentative of a family of some standing in those parts.  Familyfounded, it appears, by a Colonel Robert Sterling, called also SirRobert Sterling; a Scottish Gustavus-Adolphus soldier, whom thebreaking out of the Civil War had recalled from his Germancampaignings, and had before long, though not till after somewaverings on his part, attached firmly to the Duke of Ormond and tothe King's Party in that quarrel.  A little bit of genealogy, since itlies ready to my hand, gathered long ago out of wider studies, andpleasantly connects things individual and present with the dimuniversal crowd of things past,--may as well be inserted here asthrown away.This Colonel Robert designates himself Sterling "of Glorat;" Ibelieve, a younger branch of the well-known Stirlings of Keir inStirlingshire.  It appears he prospered in his soldiering and otherbusiness, in those bad Ormond times; being a man of energy, ardor andintelligence,--probably prompt enough both with his word and with hisstroke.  There survives yet, in the Commons Journals,[2] dim notice ofhis controversies and adventures; especially of one controversy he hadgot into with certain victorious Parliamentary official parties, whilehis own party lay vanquished, during what was called the OrmondCessation, or Temporary Peace made by Ormond with the Parliament in1646:--in which controversy Colonel Robert, after repeatedapplications, journeyings to London, attendances upon committees, andsuch like, finds himself worsted, declared to be in the wrong; and sovanishes from the Commons Journals.What became of him when Cromwell got to Ireland, and to Munster, Ihave not heard:  his knighthood, dating from the very year ofCromwell's Invasion (1649), indicates a man expected to do his best onthe occasion:--as in all probability he did; had not Tredah Stormproved ruinous, and the neck of this Irish War been broken at once.Doubtless the Colonel Sir Robert followed or attended his Duke ofOrmond into foreign parts, and gave up his management of Munster,while it was yet time:  for after the Restoration we find him again,safe, and as was natural, flourishing with new splendor; gifted,recompensed with lands;--settled, in short, on fair revenues in thoseMunster regions.  He appears to have had no children; but to have lefthis property to William, a younger brother who had followed him intoIreland.  From this William descends the family which, in the years wetreat of, had Edward Sterling, Father of our John, for itsrepresentative.  And now enough of genealogy.Of Edward Sterling, Captain Edward Sterling as his title was, who inthe latter period of his life became well known in London politicalsociety, whom indeed all England, with a curious mixture of mockeryand respect and even fear, knew well as "the Thunderer of the TimesNewspaper," there were much to be said, did the present task and itslimits permit.  As perhaps it might, on certain terms?  What isindispensable let us not omit to say.  The history of a man'schildhood is the description of his parents and environment:  this ishis inarticulate but highly important history, in those first times,while of articulate he has yet none.Edward Sterling had now just entered on his thirty-fourth year; andwas already a man experienced in fortunes and changes.  A native ofWaterford in Munster, as already mentioned; born in the "Deanery Houseof Waterford, 27th February, 1773," say the registers.  For hisFather, as we learn, resided in the Deanery House, though he was nothimself Dean, but only "Curate of the Cathedral" (whatever that maymean); he was withal rector of two other livings, and the Dean'sfriend,--friend indeed of the Dean's kinsmen the Beresfords generally;whose grand house of Curraghmore, near by Waterford, was a familiarhaunt of his and his children's.  This reverend gentleman, along withhis three livings and high acquaintanceships, had inherited politicalconnections;--inherited especially a Government Pension, withsurvivorship for still one life beyond his own; his father having beenClerk of the Irish House of Commons at the time of the Union, of whichoffice the lost salary was compensated in this way.  The Pension wasof two hundred pounds; and only expired with the life of Edward,John's Father, in 1847.  There were, and still are, daughters of thefamily; but Edward was the only son;--descended, too, from theScottish hero Wallace, as the old gentleman would sometimes admonishhim; his own wife, Edward's mother, being of that name, and boastingherself, as most Scotch Wallaces do, to have that blood in her veins.This Edward had picked up, at Waterford, and among the youngBeresfords of Curraghmore and elsewhere, a thoroughly Irish form ofcharacter:  fire and fervor, vitality of all kinds, in genialabundance; but in a much more loquacious, ostentatious, much _louder_style than is freely patronized on this side of the Channel.  Of Irishaccent in speech he had entirely divested himself, so as not to betraced by any vestige in that respect; but his Irish accent ofcharacter, in all manner of other more important respects, was veryrecognizable.  An impetuous man, full of real energy, and immenselyconscious of the same; who transacted everything not with the minimumof fuss and noise, but with the maximum:  a very Captain Whirlwind, asone was tempted to call him.In youth, he had studied at Trinity College, Dublin; visited the Innsof Court here, and trained himself for the Irish Bar.  To the Bar hehad been duly called, and was waiting for the results,--when, in histwenty-fifth year, the Irish Rebellion broke out; whereupon the IrishBarristers decided to raise a corps of loyal Volunteers, and acomplete change introduced itself into Edward Sterling's way of life.For, naturally, he had joined the array of Volunteers;--fought, I haveheard, "in three actions with the rebels" (Vinegar Hill, for one); anddoubtless fought well:  but in the mess-rooms, among the youngmilitary and civil officials, with all of whom he was a favorite, hehad acquired a taste for soldier life, and perhaps high hopes ofsucceeding in it:  at all events, having a commission in theLancashire Militia offered him, he accepted that; altogether quittedthe Bar, and became Captain Sterling thenceforth.  From the Militia,it appears, he had volunteered with his Company into the Line; and,under some disappointments, and official delays of expected promotion,was continuing to serve as Captain there, "Captain of the EighthBattalion of Reserve," say the Military Almanacs of 1803,--in whichyear the quarters happened to be Derry, where new events awaited him.At a ball in Derry he met with Miss Hester Coningham, the queen of thescene, and of the fair world in Derry at that time.  The acquaintance,in spite of some Opposition, grew with vigor, and rapidly ripened:and "at Fehan Church, Diocese of Derry," where the Bride's father hada country-house, "on Thursday 5th April, 1804, Hester Coningham, onlydaughter of John Coningham, Esquire, Merchant in Derry, and ofElizabeth Campbell his wife," was wedded to Captain Sterling; shehappiest to him happiest,--as by Nature's kind law it is arranged.Mrs. Sterling, even in her later days, had still traces of the oldbeauty:  then and always she was a woman of delicate, pious,affectionate character; exemplary as a wife, a mother and a friend.  Arefined female nature; something tremulous in it, timid, and with acertain rural freshness still unweakened by long converse with theworld.  The tall slim figure, always of a kind of quaker neatness; theinnocent anxious face, anxious bright hazel eyes; the timid, yetgracefully cordial ways, the natural intelligence, instinctive senseand worth, were very characteristic.  Her voice too; with itssomething of soft querulousness, easily adapting itself to a lightthin-flowing style of mirth on occasion, was characteristic:  she hadretained her Ulster intonations, and was withal somewhat copious inspeech.  A fine tremulously sensitive nature, strong chiefly on theside of the affections, and the graceful insights and activities thatdepend on these:--truly a beautiful, much-suffering, much-lovinghouse-mother.  From her chiefly, as one could discern, John Sterlinghad derived the delicate _aroma_ of his nature, its piety, clearness,sincerity; as from his Father, the ready practical gifts, theimpetuosities and the audacities, were also (though in strange newform) visibly inherited.  A man was lucky to have such a Mother; tohave such Parents as both his were.Meanwhile the new Wife appears to have had, for the present, nomarriage-portion; neither was Edward Sterling rich,--according to hisown ideas and aims, far from it.  Of course he soon found that thefluctuating barrack-life, especially with no outlooks of speedypromotion, was little suited to his new circumstances:  but how changeit?  His father was now dead; from whom he had inherited the SpeakerPension of two hundred pounds; but of available probably little ornothing more.  The rents of the small family estate, I suppose, andother property, had gone to portion sisters.  Two hundred pounds, andthe pay of a marching captain:  within the limits of that revenue allplans of his had to restrict themselves at present.He continued for some time longer in the Army; his wife undivided fromhim by the hardships, of that way of life.  Their first son Anthony(Captain Anthony Sterling, the only child who now survives) was bornto them in this position, while lying at Dundalk, in January, 1805.Two months later, some eleven months after their marriage, theregiment was broken; and Captain Sterling, declining to serveelsewhere on the terms offered, and willingly accepting such decisionof his doubts, was reduced to half-pay.  This was the end of hissoldiering:  some five or six years in all; from which he had derivedfor life, among other things, a decided military bearing, whereof hewas rather proud; an incapacity for practicing law;--and considerableuncertainty as to what his next course of life was now to be.For the present, his views lay towards farming:  to establish himself,if not as country gentleman, which was an unattainable ambition, thenat least as some kind of gentleman-farmer which had a flatteringresemblance to that.  Kaimes Castle with a reasonable extent of land,which, in his inquiries after farms, had turned up, was his firstplace of settlement in this new capacity; and here, for some fewmonths, he had established himself when John his second child wasborn.  This was Captain Sterling's first attempt towards a fixedcourse of life; not a very wise one, I have understood:--yet on thewhole, who, then and there, could have pointed out to him a wiser?A fixed course of life and activity he could never attain, or not tillvery late; and this doubtless was among the important points of hisdestiny, and acted both on his own character and that of those who hadto attend him on his wayfarings.CHAPTER III.SCHOOLS:  LLANBLETHIAN; PARIS; LONDON.Edward Sterling never shone in farming; indeed I believe he never tookheartily to it, or tried it except in fits.  His Bute farm was, atbest, a kind of apology for some far different ideal of a countryestablishment which could not be realized; practically a temporarylanding-place from which he could make sallies and excursions insearch of some more generous field of enterprise.  Stormy briefefforts at energetic husbandry, at agricultural improvement and rapidfield-labor, alternated with sudden flights to Dublin, to London,whithersoever any flush of bright outlook which he could denominatepractical, or any gleam of hope which his impatient ennui couldrepresent as such, allured him.  This latter was often enough thecase.  In wet hay-times and harvest-times, the dripping outdoor world,and lounging indoor one, in the absence of the master, offered farfrom a satisfactory appearance!  Here was, in fact, a man muchimprisoned; haunted, I doubt not, by demons enough; though ever briskand brave withal,--iracund, but cheerfully vigorous, opulent in wiseor unwise hope.  A fiery energetic soul consciously and unconsciouslystorming for deliverance into better arenas; and this in a restless,rapid, impetuous, rather than in a strong, silent and deliberate way.In rainy Bute and the dilapidated Kaimes Castle, it was evident, therelay no Goshen for such a man.  The lease, originally but for somethree years and a half, drawing now to a close, he resolved to quitBute; had heard, I know not where, of an eligible cottage without farmattached, in the pleasant little village of Llanblethian close byCowbridge in Glamorganshire; of this he took a lease, and thither withhis family he moved in search of new fortunes.  Glamorganshire was atleast a better climate than Bute; no groups of idle or of busy reaperscould here stand waiting on the guidance of a master, for there was nofarm here;--and among its other and probably its chief though secretadvantages, Llanblethian was much more convenient both for Dublin andLondon than Kaimes Castle had been.The removal thither took place in the autumn of 1809.  Chief part ofthe journey (perhaps from Greenock to Swansea or Bristol) was by sea:John, just turned of three years, could in after-times remembernothing of this voyage; Anthony, some eighteen months older, has stilla vivid recollection of the gray splashing tumult, and dim sorrow,uncertainty, regret and distress he underwent:  to him a"dissolving-view" which not only left its effect on the _plate_ (asall views and dissolving-views doubtless do on that kind of "plate"),but remained consciously present there.  John, in the close of histwenty-first year, professes not to remember anything whatever ofBute; his whole existence, in that earliest scene of it, had fadedaway from him:  Bute also, with its shaggy mountains, moaning woods,and summer and winter seas, had been wholly a dissolving-view for him,and had left no conscious impression, but only, like this voyage, aneffect.Llanblethian hangs pleasantly, with its white cottages, and orchardand other trees, on the western slope of a green hill looking far andwide over green meadows and little or bigger hills, in the pleasantplain of Glamorgan; a short mile to the south of Cowbridge, to whichsmart little town it is properly a kind of suburb.  Plain ofGlamorgan, some ten miles wide and thirty or forty long, which theycall the Vale of Glamorgan;--though properly it is not quite a Vale,there being only one range of mountains to it, if even one:  certainlythe central Mountains of Wales do gradually rise, in a miscellaneousmanner, on the north side of it; but on the south are no mountains,not even land, only the Bristol Channel, and far off, the Hills ofDevonshire, for boundary,--the "English Hills," as the natives callthem, visible from every eminence in those parts.  On such wide termsis it called Vale of Glamorgan.  But called by whatever name, it is amost pleasant fruitful region:  kind to the native, interesting to thevisitor.  A waving grassy region; cut with innumerable ragged lanes;dotted with sleepy unswept human hamlets, old ruinous castles withtheir ivy and their daws, gray sleepy churches with their ditto ditto:for ivy everywhere abounds; and generally a rank fragrant vegetationclothes all things; hanging, in rude many-colored festoons and fringedodoriferous tapestries, on your right and on your left, in every lane.A country kinder to the sluggard husbandman than any I have ever seen.For it lies all on limestone, needs no draining; the soil, everywhereof handsome depth and finest quality, will grow good crops for youwith the most imperfect tilling.  At a safe distance of a day's ridinglie the tartarean copper-forges of Swansea, the tartarean iron-forgesof Merthyr; their sooty battle far away, and not, at such safedistance, a defilement to the face of the earth and sky, but rather anencouragement to the earth at least; encouraging the husbandman toplough better, if he only would.The peasantry seem indolent and stagnant, but peaceable andwell-provided; much given to Methodism when they have anycharacter;--for the rest, an innocent good-humored people, who alldrink home-brewed beer, and have brown loaves of the most excellenthome-baked bread.  The native peasant village is not generallybeautiful, though it might be, were it swept and trimmed; it gives onerather the idea of sluttish stagnancy,--an interesting peep into theWelsh Paradise of Sleepy Hollow.  Stones, old kettles, naves ofwheels, all kinds of broken litter, with live pigs and etceteras, lieabout the street:  for, as a rule, no rubbish is removed, but waitspatiently the action of mere natural chemistry and accident; if even ahouse is burnt or falls, you will find it there after half a century,only cloaked by the ever-ready ivy.  Sluggish man seems never to havestruck a pick into it; his new hut is built close by on ground notencumbered, and the old stones are still left lying.This is the ordinary Welsh village; but there are exceptions, wherepeople of more cultivated tastes have been led to settle, andLlanblethian is one of the more signal of these.  A decidedly cheerfulgroup of human homes, the greater part of them indeed belonging topersons of refined habits; trimness, shady shelter, whitewash, neitherconveniency nor decoration has been neglected here.  Its effect fromthe distance on the eastward is very pretty:  you see it like a littlesleeping cataract of white houses, with trees overshadowing andfringing it; and there the cataract hangs, and does not rush away fromyou.John Sterling spent his next five years in this locality.  He did notagain see it for a quarter of a century; but retained, all his life, alively remembrance of it; and, just in the end of his twenty-firstyear, among his earliest printed pieces, we find an elaborate anddiffuse description of it and its relations to him,--part of whichpiece, in spite of its otherwise insignificant quality, may find placehere:--"The fields on which I first looked, and the sands which were markedby my earliest footsteps, are completely lost to my memory; and ofthose ancient walls among which I began to breathe, I retain norecollection more clear than the outlines of a cloud in a moonlesssky.  But of L----, the village where I afterwards lived, I persuademyself that every line and hue is more deeply and accurately fixedthan those of any spot I have since beheld, even though borne in uponthe heart by the association of the strongest feelings."My home was built upon the slope of a hill, with a little orchardstretching down before it, and a garden rising behind.  At aconsiderable distance beyond and beneath the orchard, a rivulet flowedthrough meadows and turned a mill; while, above the garden, the summitof the hill was crowned by a few gray rocks, from which a yew-treegrew, solitary and bare.  Extending at each side of the orchard,toward the brook, two scattered patches of cottages lay nestled amongtheir gardens; and beyond this streamlet and the little mill andbridge, another slight eminence arose, divided into green fields,tufted and bordered with copsewood, and crested by a ruined castle,contemporary, as was said, with the Conquest. I know not whether thesethings in truth made up a prospect of much beauty.  Since I was eightyears old, I have never seen them; but I well know that no landscape Ihave since beheld, no picture of Claude or Salvator, gave me half theimpression of living, heartfelt, perfect beauty which fills my mindwhen I think of that green valley, that sparkling rivulet, that brokenfortress of dark antiquity, and that hill with its aged yew and breezysummit, from which I have so often looked over the broad stretch ofverdure beneath it, and the country-town, and church-tower, silent andwhite beyond."In that little town there was, and I believe is, a school where theelements of human knowledge were communicated to me, for some hours ofevery day, during a considerable time.  The path to it lay across therivulet and past the mill; from which point we could either journeythrough the fields below the old castle, and the wood which surroundedit, or along a road at the other side of the ruin, close to thegateway of which it passed.  The former track led through two or threebeautiful fields, the sylvan domain of the keep on one hand, and thebrook on the other; while an oak or two, like giant warders advancedfrom the wood, broke the sunshine of the green with a soft andgraceful shadow.  How often, on my way to school, have I stoppedbeneath the tree to collect the fallen acorns; how often run down tothe stream to pluck a branch of the hawthorn which hung over thewater!  The road which passed the castle joined, beyond these fields,the path which traversed them.  It took, I well remember, a certainsolemn and mysterious interest from the ruin.  The shadow of thearchway, the discolorizations of time on all the walls, the dimness ofthe little thicket which encircled it, the traditions of itsimmeasurable age, made St. Quentin's Castle a wonderful and awfulfabric in the imagination of a child; and long after I last saw itsmouldering roughness, I never read of fortresses, or heights, orspectres, or banditti, without connecting them with the one ruin of mychildhood."It was close to this spot that one of the few adventures occurredwhich marked, in my mind, my boyish days with importance.  Whenloitering beyond the castle, on the way to school, with a brothersomewhat older than myself, who was uniformly my champion andprotector, we espied a round sloe high up in the hedge-row.  Wedetermined to obtain it; and I do not remember whether both of us, oronly my brother, climbed the tree.  However, when the prize was allbut reached,--and no alchemist ever looked more eagerly for the momentof projection which was to give him immortality and omnipotence,--agruff voice startled us with an oath, and an order to desist; and Iwell recollect looking back, for long after, with terror to the visionof an old and ill-tempered farmer, armed with a bill-hook, and vowingour decapitation; nor did I subsequently remember without triumph theeloquence whereby alone, in my firm belief, my brother and myself hadbeen rescued from instant death."At the entrance of the little town stood an old gateway, with apointed arch and decaying battlements.  It gave admittance to thestreet which contained the church, and which terminated in anotherstreet, the principal one in the town of C----.  In this was situatedthe school to which I daily wended.  I cannot now recall to mind theface of its good conductor, nor of any of his scholars; but I havebefore me a strong general image of the interior of his establishment.I remember the reverence with which I was wont to carry to his seat awell-thumbed duodecimo, the _History of Greece_ by Oliver Goldsmith.I remember the mental agonies I endured in attempting to master theart and mystery of penmanship; a craft in which, alas, I remained tooshort a time under Mr. R---- to become as great a proficient as hemade his other scholars, and which my awkwardness has prevented mefrom attaining in any considerable perfection under my varioussubsequent pedagogues.  But that which has left behind it a brillianttrait of light was the exhibition of what are called 'Christmaspieces;' things unknown in aristocratic seminaries, but constantlyused at the comparatively humble academy which supplied the bestknowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic to be attained in thatremote neighborhood."The long desks covered from end to end with those paintedmasterpieces, the Life of Robinson Crusoe, the Hunting of Chevy-Chase,the History of Jack the Giant-Killer, and all the little eager facesand trembling hands bent over these, and filling them up with somechoice quotation, sacred or profane;--no, the galleries of art, thetheatrical exhibitions, the reviews and processions,--which are onlynot childish because they are practiced and admired by men instead ofchildren,--all the pomps and vanities of great cities, have shown meno revelation of glory such as did that crowded school-room the weekbefore the Christmas holidays.  But these were the splendors of life.The truest and the strongest feelings do not connect themselves withany scenes of gorgeous and gaudy magnificence; they are bound up inthe remembrances of home."The narrow orchard, with its grove of old apple-trees against one ofwhich I used to lean, and while I brandished a beanstalk, roar outwith Fitzjames,--     'Come one, come all; this rock shall fly     From its firm base as soon as I!'--while I was ready to squall at the sight of a cur, and run valorouslyaway from a casually approaching cow; the field close beside it, whereI rolled about in summer among the hay; the brook in which, despite ofmaid and mother, I waded by the hour; the garden where I sowedflower-seeds, and then turned up the ground again and plantedpotatoes, and then rooted out the potatoes to insert acorns andapple-pips, and at last, as may be supposed, reaped neither roses, norpotatoes, nor oak-trees, nor apples; the grass-plots on which I playedamong those with whom I never can play nor work again:  all these areplaces and employments,--and, alas, playmates,--such as, if it wereworth while to weep at all, it would be worth weeping that I enjoy nolonger."I remember the house where I first grew familiar with peacocks; andthe mill-stream into which I once fell; and the religious awewherewith I heard, in the warm twilight, the psalm-singing around thehouse of the Methodist miller; and the door-post against which Idischarged my brazen artillery; I remember the window by which I satwhile my mother taught me French; and the patch of garden which I dugfor--  But her name is best left blank; it was indeed writ in water.These recollections are to me like the wealth of a departed friend, amournful treasure.  But the public has heard enough of them; to itthey are worthless:  they are a coin which only circulates at its truevalue between the different periods of an individual's existence, andgood for nothing but to keep up a commerce between boyhood andmanhood.  I have for years looked forward to the possibility ofvisiting L----; but I am told that it is a changed village; and notonly has man been at work, but the old yew on the hill has fallen, andscarcely a low stump remains of the tree which I delighted inchildhood to think might have furnished bows for the Normanarchers."[3]In Cowbridge is some kind of free school, or grammar-school, of acertain distinction; and this to Captain Sterling was probably amotive for settling in the neighborhood of it with his children.  Ofthis however, as it turned out, there was no use made:  the Sterlingfamily, during its continuance in those parts, did not need more thana primary school.  The worthy master who presided over these Christmasgalas, and had the honor to teach John Sterling his reading andwriting, was an elderly Mr. Reece of Cowbridge, who still (in 1851)survives, or lately did; and is still remembered by his old pupils asa worthy, ingenious and kindly man, "who wore drab breeches and whitestockings."  Beyond the Reece sphere of tuition John Sterling did notgo in this locality.In fact the Sterling household was still fluctuating; the problem of atask for Edward Sterling's powers, and of anchorage for his affairs inany sense, was restlessly struggling to solve itself, but was still agood way from being solved.  Anthony, in revisiting these scenes withJohn in 1839, mentions going to the spot "where we used to stand withour Father, looking out for the arrival of the London mail:"  a littlechink through which is disclosed to us a big restless section of ahuman life.  The Hill of Welsh Llanblethian, then, is like the mythicCaucasus in its degree (as indeed all hills and habitations where mensojourn are); and here too, on a small scale, is a Prometheus Chained!Edward Sterling, I can well understand, was a man to tug at the chainsthat held him idle in those the prime of his years; and to askrestlessly, yet not in anger and remorse, so much as in hope,locomotive speculation, and ever-new adventure and attempt, Is thereno task nearer my own natural size, then?  So he looks out from theHill-side "for the arrival of the London mail;" thence hurries intoCowbridge to the Post-office; and has a wide web, of threads andgossamers, upon his loom, and many shuttles flying, in this world.By the Marquis of Bute's appointment he had, very shortly after hisarrival in that region, become Adjutant of the Glamorganshire Militia,"Local Militia," I suppose; and was, in this way, turning his militarycapabilities to some use.  The office involved pretty frequentabsences, in Cardiff and elsewhere.  This doubtless was a welcomeoutlet, though a small one.  He had also begun to try writing,especially on public subjects; a much more copious outlet,--whichindeed, gradually widening itself, became the final solution for him.Of the year 1811 we have a Pamphlet of his, entitled _MilitaryReform_; this is the second edition, "dedicated to the Duke of Kent;"the first appears to have come out the year before, and had thusattained a certain notice, which of course was encouraging.  He nowfurthermore opened a correspondence with the _Times_ Newspaper; wroteto it, in 1812, a series of Letters under the signature _Vetus_:voluntary Letters I suppose, without payment or pre-engagement, onesuccessful Letter calling out another; till _Vetus_ and his doctrinescame to be a distinguishable entity, and the business amounted tosomething.  Out of my own earliest Newspaper reading, I can rememberthe name _Vetus_, as a kind of editorial hacklog on which able-editorswere wont to chop straw now and then.  Nay the Letters were collectedand reprinted; both this first series, of 1812, and then a second ofnext year:  two very thin, very dim-colored cheap octavos; straycopies of which still exist, and may one day become distillable into adrop of History (should such be wanted of our poor "Scavenger Age" intime coming), though the reading of them has long ceased in thisgeneration.[4]  The first series, we perceive, had even gone to asecond edition.  The tone, wherever one timidly glances into thisextinct cockpit, is trenchant and emphatic:  the name of _Vetus_,strenuously fighting there, had become considerable in the talkingpolitical world; and, no doubt, was especially of mark, as that of awriter who might otherwise be important, with the proprietors of the_Times_.  The connection continued:  widened and deepened itself,--ina slow tentative manner; passing naturally from voluntary intoremunerated:  and indeed proving more and more to be the true ultimatearena, and battle-field and seed-field, for the exuberantimpetuosities and faculties of this man.What the _Letters of Vetus_ treated of I do not know; doubtless theyran upon Napoleon, Catholic Emancipation, true methods of nationaldefence, of effective foreign Anti-gallicism, and of domestic ditto;which formed the staple of editorial speculation at that time.  I haveheard in general that Captain Sterling, then and afterwards, advocated"the Marquis of Wellesley's policy;" but that also, what it was, Ihave forgotten, and the world has been willing to forget.  Enough, theheads of the _Times_ establishment, perhaps already the Marquis ofWellesley and other important persons, had their eye on this writer;and it began to be surmised by him that here at last was the career hehad been seeking.Accordingly, in 1814, when victorious Peace unexpectedly arrived; andthe gates of the Continent after five-and-twenty years of fierceclosure were suddenly thrown open; and the hearts of all English andEuropean men awoke staggering as if from a nightmare suddenly removed,and ran hither and thither,--Edward Sterling also determined on a newadventure, that of crossing to Paris, and trying what might lie instore for him.  For curiosity, in its idler sense, there was evidentlypabulum enough.  But he had hopes moreover of learning much that mightperhaps avail him afterwards;--hopes withal, I have understood, ofgetting to be Foreign Correspondent of the _Times_ Newspaper, and soadding to his income in the mean while.  He left Llanblethian in May;dates from Dieppe the 27th of that month.  He lived in occasionalcontact with Parisian notabilities (all of them except Madame de Staelforgotten now), all summer, diligently surveying his ground;--returnedfor his family, who were still in Wales but ready to move, in thebeginning of August; took them immediately across with him; a house inthe neighborhood of Paris, in the pleasant village of Passy at oncetown and country, being now ready; and so, under foreign skies, againset up his household there.Here was a strange new "school" for our friend John now in his eighthyear!  Out of which the little Anthony and he drank doubtless at allpores, vigorously as they had done in no school before.  A changetotal and immediate.  Somniferous green Llanblethian has suddenly beenblotted out; presto, here are wakeful Passy and the noises of pavedParis instead.  Innocent ingenious Mr. Reece in drab breeches andwhite stockings, he with his mild Christmas galas and peaceable rulesof Dilworth and Butterworth, has given place to such a saturnalia ofpanoramic, symbolic and other teachers and monitors, addressing allthe five senses at once.  Who John's express tutors were, at Passy, Inever heard; nor indeed, especially in his case, was it much worthinquiring.  To him and to all of us, the expressly appointedschoolmasters and schoolings we get are as nothing, compared with theunappointed incidental and continual ones, whose school-hours are allthe days and nights of our existence, and whose lessons, noticed orunnoticed, stream in upon us with every breath we draw.  Anthony saysthey attended a French school, though only for about three months; andhe well remembers the last scene of it, "the boys shouting _Vivel'Empereur_ when Napoleon came back."Of John Sterling's express schooling, perhaps the most importantfeature, and by no means a favorable one to him, was the excessivefluctuation that prevailed in it.  Change of scene, change of teacher,_both_ express and implied, was incessant with him; and gave his younglife a nomadic character,--which surely, of all the adventitioustendencies that could have been impressed upon him, so volatile, swiftand airy a being as him, was the one he needed least. His gentlepious-hearted Mother, ever watching over him in all outward changes,and assiduously keeping human pieties and good affections alive inhim, was probably the best counteracting element in his lot.  And onthe whole, have we not all to run our chance in that respect; andtake, the most victoriously we can, such schooling as pleases to beattainable in our year and place?  Not very victoriously, the most ofus!  A wise well-calculated breeding of a young genial soul in thisworld, or alas of any young soul in it, lies fatally over the horizonin these epochs!--This French scene of things, a grand school of itssort, and also a perpetual banquet for the young soul, naturallycaptivated John Sterling; he said afterwards, "New things andexperiences here were poured upon his mind and sense, not in streams,but in a Niagara cataract."  This too, however, was but a scene;lasted only some six or seven months; and in the spring of the nextyear terminated as abruptly as any of the rest could do.For in the spring of the next year, Napoleon abruptly emerged fromElba; and set all the populations of the world in motion, in a strangemanner;--set the Sterling household afloat, in particular; the bigEuropean tide rushing into all smallest creeks, at Passy andelsewhere.  In brief, on the 20th of March, 1815, the family had toshift, almost to fly, towards home and the sea-coast; and for a day ortwo were under apprehension of being detained and not reaching home.Mrs. Sterling, with her children and effects, all in one big carriagewith two horses, made the journey to Dieppe; in perfect safety, thoughin continual tremor:  here they were joined by Captain Sterling, whohad stayed behind at Paris to see the actual advent of Napoleon, andto report what the aspect of affairs was, "Downcast looks of citizens,with fierce saturnalian acclaim of soldiery:"  after which theyproceeded together to London without farther apprehension;--there towitness, in due time, the tar-barrels of Waterloo, and other phenomenathat followed.Captain Sterling never quitted London as a residence any more; andindeed was never absent from it, except on autumnal or otherexcursions of a few weeks, till the end of his life.  Nevertheless hiscourse there was as yet by no means clear; nor had his relations withthe heads of the _Times_, or with other high heads, assumed a formwhich could be called definite, but were hanging as a cloudy maze ofpossibilities, firm substance not yet divided from shadow.  Itcontinued so for some years.  The Sterling household shifted twice orthrice to new streets or localities,--Russell Square or Queen Square,Blackfriars Road, and longest at the Grove, Blackheath,-- before thevapors of Wellesley promotions and such like slowly sank as uselessprecipitate, and the firm rock, which was definite employment, endingin lucrative co-proprietorship and more and more important connectionwith the _Times_ Newspaper, slowly disclosed itself.These changes of place naturally brought changes in John Sterling'sschoolmasters:  nor were domestic tragedies wanting, still moreimportant to him.  New brothers and sisters had been born; two littlebrothers more, three little sisters he had in all; some of whom cameto their eleventh year beside him, some passed away in their second orfourth:  but from his ninth to his sixteenth year they all died; andin 1821 only Anthony and John were left.[5]  How many tears, andpassionate pangs, and soft infinite regrets; such as are appointed toall mortals!  In one year, I find, indeed in one half-year, he lostthree little playmates, two of them within one month.  His own age wasnot yet quite twelve.  For one of these three, for little Edward, hisnext younger, who died now at the age of nine, Mr. Hare records thatJohn copied out, in large school-hand, a _History of Valentine andOrson_, to beguile the poor child's sickness, which ended in deathsoon, leaving a sad cloud on John.Of his grammar and other schools, which, as I said, are hardly worthenumerating in comparison, the most important seems to have been a Dr.Burney's at Greenwich; a large day-schoo] and boarding-school, whereAnthony and John gave their attendance for a year or two (1818-19)from Blackheath.  "John frequently did themes for the boys," saysAnthony, "and for myself when I was aground."  His progress in allschool learning was certain to be rapid, if he even moderately took toit.  A lean, tallish, loose-made boy of twelve; strange alacrity,rapidity and joyous eagerness looking out of his eyes, and of all hisways and movements.  I have a Picture of him at this stage; a littleportrait, which carries its verification with it.  In manhood too, thechief expression of his eyes and physiognomy was what I might callalacrity, cheerful rapidity.  You could see, here looked forth a soulwhich was winged; which dwelt in hope and action, not in hesitation orfear.  Anthony says, he was "an affectionate and gallant kind of boy,adventurous and generous, daring to a singular degree."  Apt enoughwithal to be "petulant now and then;" on the whole, "veryself-willed;" doubtless not a little discursive in his thoughts andways, and "difficult to manage."I rather think Anthony, as the steadier, more substantial boy, was theMother's favorite; and that John, though the quicker and cleverer,perhaps cost her many anxieties.  Among the Papers given me, is an oldbrowned half-sheet in stiff school hand, unpunctuated, occasionallyill spelt,--John Sterling's earliest remaining Letter,--which givesrecord of a crowning escapade of his, the first and the last of itskind; and so may be inserted here.  A very headlong adventure on theboy's part; so hasty and so futile, at once audacious andimpracticable; emblematic of much that befell in the history of theman!                   "_To Mrs. Sterling, Blackheath_.                                                "21st September, 1818.                                                                      "DEAR MAMMA,--I am now at Dover, where I arrived this morning aboutseven o'clock.  When you thought I was going to church, I went downthe Kent Road, and walked on till I came to Gravesend, which isupwards of twenty miles from Blackheath; at about seven o'clock in theevening, without having eat anything the whole time.  I applied to aninkeeper (_sic_) there, pretending that I had served a haberdasher inLondon, who left of (_sic_) business, and turned me away.  He believedme; and got me a passage in the coach here, for I said that I had anUncle here, and that my Father and Mother were dead;--when I wanderedabout the quays for some time, till I met Captain Keys, whom I askedto give me a passage to Boulogne; which he promised to do, and took mehome to breakfast with him:  but Mrs. Keys questioned me a good deal;when I not being able to make my story good, I was obliged to confessto her that I had run away from you.  Captain Keys says that he willkeep me at his house till you answer my letter.                                                        "J. STERLING."Anthony remembers the business well; but can assign no origin toit,--some penalty, indignity or cross put suddenly on John, which thehasty John considered unbearable.  His Mother's inconsolable weeping,and then his own astonishment at such a culprit's being forgiven, areall that remain with Anthony.  The steady historical style of theyoung runaway of twelve, narrating merely, not in the leastapologizing, is also noticeable.This was some six months after his little brother Edward's death;three months after that of Hester, his little sister next in thefamily series to him:  troubled days for the poor Mother in that smallhousehold on Blackheath, as there are for mothers in so manyhouseholds in this world!  I have heard that Mrs. Sterling passed muchof her time alone, at this period.  Her husband's pursuits, with hisWellesleys and the like, often carrying him into Town and detaininghim late there, she would sit among her sleeping children, such ofthem as death had still spared, perhaps thriftily plying her needle,full of mournful affectionate night-thoughts,--apprehensive too, inher tremulous heart, that the head of the house might have fallenamong robbers in his way homeward.CHAPTER IV.UNIVERSITIES:  GLASGOW; CAMBRIDGE.At a later stage, John had some instruction from a Dr. Waite atBlackheath; and lastly, the family having now removed into Town, toSeymour Street in the fashionable region there, he "read for a whilewith Dr. Trollope, Master of Christ's Hospital;" which ended hisschool history.In this his ever-changing course, from Reece at Cowbridge to Trollopein Christ's, which was passed so nomadically, under ferulas of variouscolor, the boy had, on the whole, snatched successfully a fair shareof what was going.  Competent skill in construing Latin, I think alsoan elementary knowledge of Greek; add ciphering to a small extent,Euclid perhaps in a rather imaginary condition; a swift but not verylegible or handsome penmanship, and the copious prompt habit ofemploying it in all manner of unconscious English prose composition,or even occasionally in verse itself:  this, or something like this,he had gained from his grammar-schools:  this is the most of what theyoffer to the poor young soul in general, in these indigent times.  Theexpress schoolmaster is not equal to much at present,--while the_un_express, for good or for evil, is so busy with a poor littlefellow!  Other departments of schooling had been infinitely moreproductive, for our young friend, than the gerund-grinding one.  Avoracious reader I believe he all along was,--had "read the wholeEdinburgh Review" in these boyish years, and out of the circulatinglibraries one knows not what cartloads; wading like Ulysses towardshis palace "through infinite dung."  A voracious observer andparticipator in all things he likewise all along was; and had had hissights, and reflections, and sorrows and adventures, from KaimesCastle onward,--and had gone at least to Dover on his own score._Puer bonae spei_, as the school-albums say; a boy of whom much may behoped?  Surely, in many senses, yes.  A frank veracity is in him,truth and courage, as the basis of all; and of wild gifts and gracesthere is abundance.  I figure him a brilliant, swift, voluble,affectionate and pleasant creature; out of whom, if it were not thatsymptoms of delicate health already show themselves, great thingsmight be made.  Promotions at least, especially in this country andepoch of parliaments and eloquent palavers, are surely very possiblefor such a one!Being now turned of sixteen, and the family economics getting yearlymore propitious and flourishing, he, as his brother had already been,was sent to Glasgow University, in which city their Mother hadconnections.  His brother and he were now all that remained of theyoung family; much attached to one another in their College years asafterwards.  Glasgow, however, was not properly their College scene:here, except that they had some tuition from Mr. Jacobson, then asenior fellow-student, now (1851) the learned editor of St. Basil, andRegius Professor of Divinity in Oxford, who continued ever afterwardsa valued intimate of John's, I find nothing special recorded of them.The Glasgow curriculum, for John especially, lasted but one year; who,after some farther tutorage from Mr. Jacobson or Dr. Trollope, wasappointed for a more ambitious sphere of education.In the beginning of his nineteenth year, "in the autumn of 1824," hewent to Trinity College, Cambridge.  His brother Anthony, who hadalready been there a year, had just quitted this Establishment, andentered on a military life under good omens; I think, at Dublin underthe Lord Lieutenant's patronage, to whose service he was, in somecapacity, attached.  The two brothers, ever in company hitherto,parted roads at this point; and, except on holiday visits and byfrequent correspondence, did not again live together; but theycontinued in a true fraternal attachment while life lasted, and Ibelieve never had any even temporary estrangement, or on either side acause for such.  The family, as I said, was now, for the last threeyears, reduced to these two; the rest of the young ones, with theirlaughter and their sorrows, all gone.  The parents otherwise wereprosperous in outward circumstances; the Father's position more andmore developing itself into affluent security, an agreeable circle ofacquaintance, and a certain real influence, though of a peculiar sort,according to his gifts for work in this world.Sterling's Tutor at Trinity College was Julius Hare, now thedistinguished Archdeacon of Lewes:--who soon conceived a great esteemfor him, and continued ever afterwards, in looser or closerconnection, his loved and loving friend.  As the Biographical andEditorial work above alluded to abundantly evinces.  Mr. Harecelebrates the wonderful and beautiful gifts, the sparkling ingenuity,ready logic, eloquent utterance, and noble generosities and pieties ofhis pupil;--records in particular how once, on a sudden alarm of firein some neighboring College edifice while his lecture was proceeding,all hands rushed out to help; how the undergraduates instantly formedthemselves in lines from the fire to the river, and in swiftcontinuance kept passing buckets as was needful, till the enemy wasvisibly fast yielding,--when Mr. Hare, going along the line, wasastonished to find Sterling, at the river-end of it, standing up tohis waist in water, deftly dealing with the buckets as they came andwent.  You in the river, Sterling; you with your coughs, and dangeroustendencies of health!--"Somebody must be in it," answered Sterling;"why not I, as well as another?"  Sterling's friends may remember manytraits of that kind.  The swiftest in all things, he was apt to befound at the head of the column, whithersoever the march might be; iftowards any brunt of danger, there was he surest to be at the head;and of himself and his peculiar risks or impediments he was negligentat all times, even to an excessive and plainly unreasonable degree.Mr. Hare justly refuses him the character of an exact scholar, ortechnical proficient at any time in either of the ancient literatures.But he freely read in Greek and Latin, as in various modern languages;and in all fields, in the classical as well, his lively faculty ofrecognition and assimilation had given him large booty in proportionto his labor.  One cannot under any circumstances conceive of Sterlingas a steady dictionary philologue, historian, or archaeologist; nordid he here, nor could he well, attempt that course.  At the sametime, Greek and the Greeks being here before him, he could not fail togather somewhat from it, to take some hue and shape from it.Accordingly there is, to a singular extent, especially in his earlywritings, a certain tinge of Grecism and Heathen classicalitytraceable in him;--Classicality, indeed, which does not satisfy one'ssense as real or truly living, but which glitters with a certaingenial, if perhaps almost meretricious half-_japannish_splendor,--greatly distinguishable from mere gerund-grinding, anddeath in longs and shorts.  If Classicality mean the practicalconception, or attempt to conceive, what human life was in the epochcalled classical,--perhaps few or none of Sterling's contemporaries inthat Cambridge establishment carried away more of availableClassicality than even he.But here, as in his former schools, his studies and inquiries,diligently prosecuted I believe, were of the most discursivewide-flowing character; not steadily advancing along beaten roadstowards College honors, but pulsing out with impetuous irregularitynow on this tract, now on that, towards whatever spiritual Delphimight promise to unfold the mystery of this world, and announce to himwhat was, in our new day, the authentic message of the gods.  Hisspeculations, readings, inferences, glances and conclusions weredoubtless sufficiently encyclopedic; his grand tutors the multifariousset of Books he devoured.  And perhaps,--as is the singular case inmost schools and educational establishments of this unexampledepoch,--it was not the express set of arrangements in this or anyextant University that could essentially forward him, but only theimplied and silent ones; less in the prescribed "course of study,"which seems to tend no-whither, than--if you will consider it--in thegenerous (not ungenerous) rebellion against said prescribed course,and the voluntary spirit of endeavor and adventure excited thereby,does help lie for a brave youth in such places.  Curious to consider.The fagging, the illicit boating, and the things _forbidden_ by theschoolmaster,--these, I often notice in my Eton acquaintances, are thethings that have done them good; these, and not their inconsiderableor considerable knowledge of the Greek accidence almost at all!  Whatis Greek accidence, compared to Spartan discipline, if it can be had?That latter is a real and grand attainment.  Certainly, if rebellionis unfortunately needful, and you can rebel in a generous manner,several things may be acquired in that operation,--rigorous mutualfidelity, reticence, steadfastness, mild stoicism, and other virtuesfar transcending your Greek accidence.  Nor can the unwisest"prescribed course of study" be considered quite useless, if it haveincited you to try nobly on all sides for a course of your own.  Asingular condition of Schools and High-schools, which have come down,in their strange old clothes and "courses of study," from the monkishages into this highly unmonkish one;--tragical condition, at which theintelligent observer makes deep pause!One benefit, not to be dissevered from the most obsolete Universitystill frequented by young ingenuous living souls, is that of manifoldcollision and communication with the said young souls; which, to everyone of these coevals, is undoubtedly the most important branch ofbreeding for him.  In this point, as the learned Huber hasinsisted,[6]  the two English Universities,--their studies otherwise beinggranted to be nearly useless, and even ill done of their kind,--farexcel all other Universities:  so valuable are the rules of humanbehavior which from of old have tacitly established themselves there;so manful, with all its sad drawbacks, is the style of Englishcharacter, "frank, simple, rugged and yet courteous," which hastacitly but imperatively got itself sanctioned and prescribed there.Such, in full sight of Continental and other Universities, is Huber'sopinion.  Alas, the question of University Reform goes deep atpresent; deep as the world;--and the real University of these newepochs is yet a great way from us!  Another judge in whom I haveconfidence declares further, That of these two Universities, Cambridgeis decidedly the more catholic (not Roman catholic, but Humancatholic) in its tendencies and habitudes; and that in fact, of allthe miserable Schools and High-schools in the England of these years,he, if reduced to choose from them, would choose Cambridge as a placeof culture for the young idea.  So that, in these bad circumstances,Sterling had perhaps rather made a hit than otherwise?Sterling at Cambridge had undoubtedly a wide and rather genial circleof comrades; and could not fail to be regarded and beloved by many ofthem.  Their life seems to have been an ardently speculating andtalking one; by no means excessively restrained within limits; and, inthe more adventurous heads like Sterling's, decidedly tending towardsthe latitudinarian in most things.  They had among them a DebatingSociety called The Union; where on stated evenings was much logic, andother spiritual fencing and ingenuous collision,--probably of a reallysuperior quality in that kind; for not a few of the then disputantshave since proved themselves men of parts, and attained distinction inthe intellectual walks of life.  Frederic Maurice, Richard Trench,John Kemble, Spedding, Venables, Charles Buller, Richard Milnes andothers:--I have heard that in speaking and arguing, Sterling was theacknowledged chief in this Union Club; and that "none even came nearhim, except the late Charles Buller," whose distinction in this andhigher respects was also already notable.The questions agitated seem occasionally to have touched on thepolitical department, and even on the ecclesiastical.  I have heardone trait of Sterling's eloquence, which survived on the wings ofgrinning rumor, and had evidently borne upon Church Conservatism insome form:  "Have they not,"--or perhaps it was, Has she (the Church)not,--"a black dragoon in every parish, on good pay and rations,horse-meat and man's-meat, to patrol and battle for these things?"The "black dragoon," which naturally at the moment ruffled the generalyoung imagination into stormy laughter, points towards importantconclusions in respect to Sterling at this time.  I conclude he had,with his usual alacrity and impetuous daring, frankly adopted theanti-superstitious side of things; and stood scornfully prepared torepel all aggressions or pretensions from the opposite quarter.  Inshort, that he was already, what afterwards there is no doubt abouthis being, at all points a Radical, as the name or nickname then went.In other words, a young ardent soul looking with hope and joy into aworld which was infinitely beautiful to him, though overhung withfalsities and foul cobwebs as world never was before; overloaded,overclouded, to the zenith and the nadir of it, by incredibleuncredited traditions, solemnly sordid hypocrisies, and beggarlydeliriums old and new; which latter class of objects it was clearlythe part of every noble heart to expend all its lightnings andenergies in burning up without delay, and sweeping into their nativeChaos out of such a Cosmos as this.  Which process, it did not thenseem to him could be very difficult; or attended with much other thanheroic joy, and enthusiasm of victory or of battle, to the gallantoperator, in his part of it.  This was, with modifications such asmight be, the humor and creed of College Radicalism five-and-twentyyears ago.  Rather horrible at that time; seen to be not so horriblenow, at least to have grown very universal, and to need no concealmentnow.  The natural humor and attitude, we may well regret to say,--andhonorable not dishonorable, for a brave young soul such as Sterling's,in those years in those localities!I do not find that Sterling had, at that stage, adopted the thenprevalent Utilitarian theory of human things.  But neither,apparently, had he rejected it; still less did he yet at all denounceit with the damnatory vehemence we were used to in him at a laterperiod.  Probably he, so much occupied with the negative side ofthings, had not yet thought seriously of any positive basis for hisworld; or asked himself, too earnestly, What, then, is the noble ruleof living for a man?  In this world so eclipsed and scandalouslyoverhung with fable and hypocrisy, what is the eternal fact, on whicha man may front the Destinies and the Immensities?  The day for suchquestions, sure enough to come in his case, was still but coming.Sufficient for this day be the work thereof; that of blasting intomerited annihilation the innumerable and immeasurable recognizeddeliriums, and extirpating or coercing to the due pitch those legionsof "black dragoons," of all varieties and purposes, who patrol, withhorse-meat and man's-meat, this afflicted earth, so hugely to thedetriment of it.Sterling, it appears, after above a year of Trinity College, followedhis friend Maurice into Trinity Hall, with the intention of taking adegree in Law; which intention, like many others with him, came tonothing; and in 1827 he left Trinity Hall and Cambridge altogether;here ending, after two years, his brief University life.CHAPTER V.A PROFESSION.Here, then, is a young soul, brought to the years of legal majority,furnished from his training-schools with such and such shiningcapabilities, and ushered on the scene of things to inquirepractically, What he will do there?  Piety is in the man, noble humanvalor, bright intelligence, ardent proud veracity; light and fire, innone of their many senses, wanting for him, but abundantly bestowed:a kingly kind of man;--whose "kingdom," however, in this bewilderedplace and epoch of the world will probably be difficult to find andconquer!For, alas, the world, as we said, already stands convicted to thisyoung soul of being an untrue, unblessed world; its high dignitariesmany of them phantasms and players'-masks; its worthships and worshipsunworshipful:  from Dan to Beersheba, a mad world, my masters.  Andsurely we may say, and none will now gainsay, this his idea of theworld at that epoch was nearer to the fact than at most other epochsit has been.  Truly, in all times and places, the young ardent soulthat enters on this world with heroic purpose, with veracious insight,and the yet unclouded "inspiration of the Almighty" which has given usour intelligence, will find this world a very mad one:  why else ishe, with his little outfit of heroisms and inspirations, come hitherinto it, except to make it diligently a little saner?  Of him therewould have been no need, had it been quite sane.  This is true; thiswill, in all centuries and countries, be true.And yet perhaps of no time or country, for the last two thousandyears, was it _so_ true as here in this waste-weltering epoch ofSterling's and ours.  A world all rocking and plunging, like that oldRoman one when the measure of its iniquities was full; the abysses,and subterranean and supernal deluges, plainly broken loose; in thewild dim-lighted chaos all stars of Heaven gone out.  No star ofHeaven visible, hardly now to any man; the pestiferous fogs, and foulexhalations grown continual, have, except on the highest mountaintops,blotted out all stars:  will-o'-wisps, of various course and color,take the place of stars.  Over the wild-surging chaos, in the leadenair, are only sudden glares of revolutionary lightning; then meredarkness, with philanthropistic phosphorescences, empty meteoriclights; here and there an ecclesiastical luminary still hovering,hanging on to its old quaking fixtures, pretending still to be a Moonor Sun,--though visibly it is but a Chinese lantern made of _paper_mainly, with candle-end foully dying in the heart of it.  Surely asmad a world as you could wish!If you want to make sudden fortunes in it, and achieve the temporaryhallelujah of flunkies for yourself, renouncing the perennial esteemof wise men; if you can believe that the chief end of man is tocollect about him a bigger heap of gold than ever before, in a shortertime than ever before, you will find it a most handy and every wayfurthersome, blessed and felicitous world.  But for any other humanaim, I think you will find it not furthersome.  If you in any way askpractically, How a noble life is to be led in it? you will be luckierthan Sterling or I if you get any credible answer, or find any maderoad whatever.  Alas, it is even so.  Your heart's question, if it beof that sort, most things and persons will answer with a "Nonsense!Noble life is in Drury Lane, and wears yellow boots.  You fool,compose yourself to your pudding!"--Surely, in these times, if ever inany, the young heroic soul entering on life, so opulent, full of sunnyhope, of noble valor and divine intention, is tragical as well asbeautiful to us.Of the three learned Professions none offered any likelihood forSterling.  From the Church his notions of the "black dragoon," hadthere been no other obstacle, were sufficient to exclude him.  Law hehad just renounced, his own Radical philosophies disheartening him, inface of the ponderous impediments, continual up-hill struggles andformidable toils inherent in such a pursuit:  with Medicine he hadnever been in any contiguity, that he should dream of it as a coursefor him.  Clearly enough the professions were unsuitable; they to him,he to them.  Professions, built so largely on speciosity instead ofperformance; clogged, in this bad epoch, and defaced under suchsuspicions of fatal imposture, were hateful not lovable to the youngradical soul, scornful of gross profit, and intent on ideals and humannoblenesses.  Again, the professions, were they never so perfect andveracious, will require slow steady pulling, to which this individualyoung radical, with his swift, far-darting brilliancies, and nomadicdesultory ways, is of all men the most averse and unfitted.  Noprofession could, in any case, have well gained the early love ofSterling.  And perhaps withal the most tragic element of his life iseven this, That there now was none to which he could fitly, by thosewiser than himself, have been bound and constrained, that he mightlearn to love it.  So swift, light-limbed and fiery an Arab courserought, for all manner of reasons, to have been trained to saddle andharness.  Roaming at full gallop over the heaths,--especially whenyour heath was London, and English and European life, in thenineteenth century,--he suffered much, and did comparatively little.I have known few creatures whom it was more wasteful to send forthwith the bridle thrown up, and to set to steeple-hunting instead ofrunning on highways!  But it is the lot of many such, in thisdislocated time,--Heaven mend it!  In a better time there will beother "professions" than those three extremely cramp, confused andindeed almost obsolete ones:  professions, if possible, that are true,and do _not_ require you at the threshold to constitute yourself animpostor.  Human association,--which will mean discipline, vigorouswise subordination and co-ordination,--is so unspeakably important.Professions, "regimented human pursuits," how many of honorable andmanful might be possible for men; and which should _not_, in theirresults to society, need to stumble along, in such an unwieldy futilemanner, with legs swollen into such enormous elephantiasis and no goat all in them!  Men will one day think of the force they squander inevery generation, and the fatal damage they encounter, by thisneglect.The career likeliest for Sterling, in his and the world'scircumstances, would have been what is called public life:  somesecretarial, diplomatic or other official training, to issue ifpossible in Parliament as the true field for him.  And here, beyondquestion, had the gross material conditions been allowed, hisspiritual capabilities were first-rate.  In any arena where eloquenceand argument was the point, this man was calculated to have borne thebell from all competitors.  In lucid ingenious talk and logic, in allmanner of brilliant utterance and tongue-fence, I have hardly knownhis fellow.  So ready lay his store of knowledge round him, so perfectwas his ready utterance of the same,--in coruscating wit, in jocunddrollery, in compact articulated clearness or high poignant emphasis,as the case required,--he was a match for any man in argument before acrowd of men.  One of the most supple-wristed, dexterous, graceful andsuccessful fencers in that kind.  A man, as Mr. Hare has said, "ableto argue with four or five at once;" could do the parrying all round,in a succession swift as light, and plant his hits wherever a chanceoffered.  In Parliament, such a soul put into a body of the duetoughness might have carried it far.  If ours is to be called, as Ihear some call it, the Talking Era, Sterling of all men had the talentto excel in it.Probably it was with some vague view towards chances in this directionthat Sterling's first engagement was entered upon; a brief connectionas Secretary to some Club or Association into which certain publicmen, of the reforming sort, Mr. Crawford (the Oriental Diplomatist andWriter), Mr. Kirkman Finlay (then Member for Glasgow), and otherpolitical notabilities had now formed themselves,--with what specificobjects I do not know, nor with what result if any.  I have heardvaguely, it was "to open the trade to India."  Of course they intendedto stir up the public mind into co-operation, whatever their goal orobject was:  Mr. Crawford, an intimate in the Sterling household,recognized the fine literary gift of John; and might think it a luckyhit that he had caught such a Secretary for three hundred pounds ayear.  That was the salary agreed upon; and for some months actuallyworked for and paid; Sterling becoming for the time an intimate andalmost an inmate in Mr. Crawford's circle, doubtless not withoutresults to himself beyond the secretarial work and pounds sterling:so much is certain.  But neither the Secretaryship nor the Associationitself had any continuance; nor can I now learn accurately more of itthan what is here stated;--in which vague state it must vanish fromSterling's history again, as it in great measure did from his life.From himself in after-years I never heard mention of it; nor were hispursuits connected afterwards with those of Mr. Crawford, though themutual good-will continued unbroken.In fact, however splendid and indubitable Sterling's qualificationsfor a parliamentary life, there was that in him withal which flatlyput a negative on any such project.  He had not the slowsteady-pulling diligence which is indispensable in that, as in allimportant pursuits and strenuous human competitions whatsoever.  Inevery sense, his momentum depended on velocity of stroke, rather thanon weight of metal; "beautifulest sheet-lightning," as I often said,"not to be condensed into thunder-bolts."  Add to this,--what indeedis perhaps but the same phenomenon in another form,--his bodily framewas thin, excitable, already manifesting pulmonary symptoms; a bodywhich the tear and wear of Parliament would infallibly in few monthshave wrecked and ended.  By this path there was clearly no mounting.The far-darting, restlessly coruscating soul, equips beyond all othersto shine in the Talking Era, and lead National Palavers with their_spolia opima_ captive, is imprisoned in a fragile hectic body whichquite forbids the adventure.  "_Es ist dafur gesorgt_," says Goethe,"Provision has been made that the trees do not grow into thesky;"--means are always there to stop them short of the sky.CHAPTER VI.LITERATURE:  THE ATHENAEUM.Of all forms of public life, in the Talking Era, it was clear thatonly one completely suited Sterling,--the anarchic, nomadic, entirelyaerial and unconditional one, called Literature.  To this all histendencies, and fine gifts positive and negative, were evidentlypointing; and here, after such brief attempting or thoughts to attemptat other posts, he already in this same year arrives.  As many do, andever more must do, in these our years and times.  This is the chaotichaven of so many frustrate activities; where all manner of good giftsgo up in far-seen smoke or conflagration; and whole fleets, that mighthave been war-fleets to conquer kingdoms, are _consumed_ (too truly,often), amid "fame" enough, and the admiring shouts of the vulgar,which is always fond to see fire going on.  The true Canaan and MountZion of a Talking Era must ever be Literature:  the extraneous,miscellaneous, self-elected, indescribable _Parliamentum_, or TalkingApparatus, which talks by books and printed papers.A literary Newspaper called _The Athenaeum_, the same which stillsubsists, had been founded in those years by Mr. Buckingham; JamesSilk Buckingham, who has since continued notable under variousfigures.  Mr. Buckingham's _Athenaeum_ had not as yet got into aflourishing condition; and he was willing to sell the copyright of itfor a consideration.  Perhaps Sterling and old Cambridge friends ofhis had been already writing for it.  At all events, Sterling, who hadalready privately begun writing a Novel, and was clearly lookingtowards Literature, perceived that his gifted Cambridge friend,Frederic Maurice, was now also at large in a somewhat similarsituation; and that here was an opening for both of them, and forother gifted friends.  The copyright was purchased for I know not whatsum, nor with whose money, but guess it may have been Sterling's, andno great sum;--and so, under free auspices, themselves their owncaptains, Maurice and he spread sail for this new voyage of adventureinto all the world.  It was about the end of 1828 that readers ofperiodical literature, and quidnuncs in those departments, began toreport the appearance, in a Paper called the _Athenaeum, of_ writingsshowing a superior brilliancy, and height of aim; one or perhaps twoslight specimens of which came into my own hands, in my remote corner,about that time, and were duly recognized by me, while the authorswere still far off and hidden behind deep veils.Some of Sterling's best Papers from the _Athenaeum_ have beenpublished by Archdeacon Hare:  first-fruits by a young man oftwenty-two; crude, imperfect, yet singularly beautiful and attractive;which will still testify what high literary promise lay in him.  Theruddiest glow of young enthusiasm, of noble incipient spiritualmanhood reigns over them; once more a divine Universe unveiling itselfin gloom and splendor, in auroral firelight and many-tinted shadow,full of hope and full of awe, to a young melodious pious heart justarrived upon it.  Often enough the delineation has a certain flowingcompleteness, not to be expected from so young an artist; here andthere is a decided felicity of insight; everywhere the point of viewadopted is a high and noble one, and the result worked out a result tobe sympathized with, and accepted so far as it will go.  Good readingstill, those Papers, for the less-furnished mind,--thrice-excellentreading compared with what is usually going.  For the rest, a grandmelancholy is the prevailing impression they leave;--partly as if,while the surface was so blooming and opulent, the heart of them wasstill vacant, sad and cold.  Here is a beautiful mirage, in the drywilderness; but you cannot quench your thirst there!  The writer'sheart is indeed still too vacant, except of beautiful shadows andreflexes and resonances; and is far from joyful, though it wearscommonly a smile.In some of the Greek delineations (_The Lycian Painter_, for example),we have already noticed a strange opulence of splendor,characterizable as half-legitimate, half-meretricious,--a splendorhovering between the raffaelesque and the japannish.  What otherthings Sterling wrote there, I never knew; nor would he in any mood,in those later days, have told you, had you asked.  This period of hislife he always rather accounted, as the Arabs do the idolatrous timesbefore Mahomet's advent, the "period of darkness."CHAPTER VII.REGENT STREET.0n the commercial side the _Athenaeum_ still lacked success; nor waslike to find it under the highly uncommercial management it had nowgot into.  This, by and by, began to be a serious consideration.  Formoney is the sinews of Periodical Literature almost as much as of waritself; without money, and under a constant drain of loss, PeriodicalLiterature is one of the things that cannot be carried on.  In no longtime Sterling began to be practically sensible of this truth, and thatan unpleasant resolution in accordance with it would be necessary.  Byhim also, after a while, the _Athenaeum_ was transferred to otherhands, better fitted in that respect; and under these it did takevigorous root, and still bears fruit according to its kind.For the present, it brought him into the thick of London Literature,especially of young London Literature and speculation; in which turbidexciting element he swam and revelled, nothing loath, for certainmonths longer,--a period short of two years in all.  He had lodgingsin Regent Street:  his Father's house, now a flourishing and stirringestablishment, in South Place, Knightsbridge, where, under the warmthof increasing revenue and success, miscellaneous cheerful socialitiesand abundant speculations, chiefly political (and not John's kind, butthat of the _Times_ Newspaper and the Clubs), were rife, he couldvisit daily, and yet be master of his own studies and pursuits.Maurice, Trench, John Mill, Charles Buller:  these, and some fewothers, among a wide circle of a transitory phantasmal character, whomhe speedily forgot and cared not to remember, were much about him;with these he in all ways employed and disported himself:  a firstfavorite with them all.No pleasanter companion, I suppose, had any of them.  So frank, open,guileless, fearless, a brother to all worthy souls whatsoever.  Comewhen you might, here is he open-hearted, rich in cheerful fancies, ingrave logic, in all kinds of bright activity.  If perceptibly orimperceptibly there is a touch of ostentation in him, blame it not; itis so innocent, so good and childlike.  He is still fonder of jinglingpublicly, and spreading on the table, your big purse of opulences thanhis own.  Abrupt too he is, cares little for big-wigs and garnitures;perhaps laughs more than the real fun he has would order; but ofarrogance there is no vestige, of insincerity or of ill-nature none.These must have been pleasant evenings in Regent Street, when thecircle chanced to be well adjusted there.  At other times, Philistineswould enter, what we call bores, dullards, Children of Darkness; andthen,--except in a hunt of dullards, and a _bore-baiting_, which mightbe permissible,--the evening was dark.  Sterling, of course, hadinnumerable cares withal; and was toiling like a slave; his veryrecreations almost a kind of work.  An enormous activity was in theman;--sufficient, in a body that could have held it without breaking,to have gone far, even under the unstable guidance it was like tohave!Thus, too, an extensive, very variegated circle of connections wasforming round him.  Besides his _Athenaeum_ work, and evenings inRegent Street and elsewhere, he makes visits to country-houses, theBullers' and others; converses with established gentlemen, withhonorable women not a few; is gay and welcome with the young of hisown age; knows also religious, witty, and other distinguished ladies,and is admiringly known by them.  On the whole, he is alreadylocomotive; visits hither and thither in a very rapid flying manner.Thus I find he had made one flying visit to the Cumberland Lake-regionin 1828, and got sight of Wordsworth; and in the same year anotherflying one to Paris, and seen with no undue enthusiasm theSaint-Simonian Portent just beginning to preach for itself, and Francein general simmering under a scum of impieties, levities,Saint-Simonisms, and frothy fantasticalities of all kinds, towards theboiling-over which soon made the Three Days of July famous.  But byfar the most important foreign home he visited was that of Coleridgeon the Hill of Highgate,--if it were not rather a foreign shrine andDodona-Oracle, as he then reckoned,--to which (onwards from 1828, aswould appear) he was already an assiduous pilgrim.  Concerning whom,and Sterling's all-important connection with him, there will be muchto say anon.Here, from this period, is a Letter of Sterling's, which the glimpsesit affords of bright scenes and figures now sunk, so many of them,sorrowfully to the realm of shadows, will render interesting to someof my readers.  To me on the mere Letter, not on its contents alone,there is accidentally a kind of fateful stamp.  A few months afterCharles Buller's death, while his loss was mourned by many hearts, andto his poor Mother all light except what hung upon his memory had goneout in the world, a certain delicate and friendly hand, hoping to givethe poor bereaved lady a good moment, sought out this Letter ofSterling's, one morning, and called, with intent to read it toher:--alas, the poor lady had herself fallen suddenly into thelanguors of death, help of another grander sort now close at hand; andto her this Letter was never read!On "Fanny Kemble," it appears, there is an Essay by Sterling in the_Athenaeum_ of this year:  "16th December, 1829."  Very laudatory, Iconclude.  He much admired her genius, nay was thought at one time tobe vaguely on the edge of still more chivalrous feelings.  As theLetter itself may perhaps indicate.         "_To Anthony Sterling, Esq., 24th Regiment, Dublin_.                                      "KNIGHTSBRIDGE, 10th Nov., 1829."MY DEAR ANTHONY,--Here in the Capital of England and of Europe, thereis less, so far as I hear, of movement and variety than in yourprovincial Dublin, or among the Wicklow Mountains.  We have the oldprospect of bricks and smoke, the old crowd of busy stupid faces, theold occupations, the old sleepy amusements; and the latest news thatreaches us daily has an air of tiresome, doting antiquity.  The worldhas nothing for it but to exclaim with Faust, "Give me my youthagain."  And as for me, my month of Cornish amusement is over; and Imust tie myself to my old employments.  I have not much to tell youabout these; but perhaps you may like to hear of my expedition to theWest."I wrote to Polvellan (Mr. Buller's) to announce the day on which Iintended to be there, so shortly before setting out, that there was notime to receive an answer; and when I reached Devonport, which isfifteen or sixteen miles from my place of destination, I found aletter from Mrs. Buller, saying that she was coming in two days to aBall at Plymouth, and if I chose to stay in the mean while and lookabout me, she would take me back with her.  She added an introductionto a relation of her husband's, a certain Captain Buller of theRifles, who was with the Depot there,--a pleasant person, who Ibelieve had been acquainted with Charlotte,[7] or at least had seenher.  Under his superintendence--..."On leaving Devonport with Mrs. Buller, I went some of the way bywater, up the harbor and river; and the prospects are certainly verybeautiful; to say nothing of the large ships, which I admire almost asmuch as you, though without knowing so much about them.  There is agreat deal of fine scenery all along the road to Looe; and the Houseitself, a very unpretending Gothic cottage, stands beautifully amongtrees, hills and water, with the sea at the distance of a quarter of amile."And here, among pleasant, good-natured, well-informed and cleverpeople, I spent an idle month.  I dined at one or two Corporationdinners; spent a few days at the old Mansion of Mr. Buller of Morval,the patron of West Looe; and during the rest of the time, read, wrote,played chess, lounged, and ate red mullet (he who has not done thishas not begun to live); talked of cookery to the philosophers, and ofmetaphysics to Mrs. Buller; and altogether cultivated indolence, anddeveloped the faculty of nonsense with considerable pleasure andunexampled success.  Charles Buller you know:  he has just come totown, but I have not yet seen him.  Arthur, his younger brother, Itake to be one of the handsomest men in England; and he too hasconsiderable talent.  Mr. Buller the father is rather a clever man ofsense, and particularly good-natured and gentlemanly; and his wife,who was a renowned beauty and queen of Calcutta, has still manystriking and delicate traces of what she was.  Her conversation ismore brilliant and pleasant than that of any one I know; and, at allevents, I am bound to admire her for the kindness with which shepatronizes me.  I hope that, some day or other, you may be acquaintedwith her."I believe I have seen no one in London about whom you would care tohear,--unless the fame of Fanny Kemble has passed the Channel, andastonished the Irish Barbarians in the midst of their bloody-mindedpolitics.  Young Kemble, whom you have seen, is in Germany:  but Ihave the happiness of being also acquainted with his sister, thedivine Fanny; and I have seen her twice on the stage, and three orfour times in private, since my return from Cornwall.  I had seen somebeautiful verses of hers, long before she was an actress; and herconversation is full of spirit and talent.  She never was taught toact at all; and though there are many faults in her performance ofJuliet, there is more power than in any female playing I ever saw,except Pasta's Medea.  She is not handsome, rather short, and by nomeans delicately formed; but her face is marked, and the eyes arebrilliant, dark, and full of character.  She has far more ability thanshe ever can display on the stage; but I have no doubt that, bypractice and self-culture, she will be a far finer actress at leastthan any one since Mrs. Siddons.  I was at Charles Kemble's a fewevenings ago, when a drawing of Miss Kemble, by Sir Thomas Lawrence,was brought in; and I have no doubt that you will shortly see, even inDublin, an engraving of her from it, very unlike the caricatures thathave hitherto appeared. I hate the stage; and but for her, should verylikely never have gone to a theatre again.  Even as it is, theannoyance is much more than the pleasure; but I suppose I must go tosee her in every character in which she acts.  If Charlotte cares forplays, let me know, and I will write in more detail about this newMelpomene.  I fear there are very few subjects on which I can sayanything that will in the least interest her.                      "Ever affectionately yours,                                                        "J. STERLING."Sterling and his circle, as their ardent speculation and activityfermented along, were in all things clear for progress, liberalism;their politics, and view of the Universe, decisively of the Radicalsort.  As indeed that of England then was, more than ever; the crustof old hide-bound Toryism being now openly cracking towards someincurable disruption, which accordingly ensued as the Reform Billbefore long.  The Reform Bill already hung in the wind.  Oldhide-bound Toryism, long recognized by all the world, and now at lastobliged to recognize its very self, for an overgrown Imposture,supporting itself not by human reason, but by flunky blustering andbrazen lying, superadded to mere brute force, could be no creed foryoung Sterling and his friends.  In all things he and they wereliberals, and, as was natural at this stage, democrats; contemplatingroot-and-branch innovation by aid of the hustings and ballot-box.Hustings and ballot-box had speedily to vanish out of Sterling'sthoughts:  but the character of root-and-branch innovator, essentiallyof "Radical Reformer," was indelible with him, and under all formscould be traced as his character through life.For the present, his and those young people's aim was:  By democracy,or what means there are, be all impostures put down.  Speedy end toSuperstition,--a gentle one if you can contrive it, but an end.  Whatcan it profit any mortal to adopt locutions and imaginations which donot correspond to fact; which no sane mortal can deliberately adopt inhis soul as true; which the most orthodox of mortals can only, andthis after infinite essentially _impious_ effort to put out the eyesof his mind, persuade himself to "believe that he believes"?  Awaywith it; in the name of God, come out of it, all true men!Piety of heart, a certain reality of religious faith, was alwaysSterling's, the gift of nature to him which he would not and could notthrow away; but I find at this time his religion is as good asaltogether Ethnic, Greekish, what Goethe calls the Heathen form ofreligion.  The Church, with her articles, is without relation to him.And along with obsolete spiritualisms, he sees all manner of obsoletethrones and big-wigged temporalities; and for them also can prophesy,and wish, only a speedy doom.  Doom inevitable, registered in Heaven'sChancery from the beginning of days, doom unalterable as the pillarsof the world; the gods are angry, and all nature groans, till thisdoom of eternal justice be fulfilled.With gay audacity, with enthusiasm tempered by mockery, as is themanner of young gifted men, this faith, grounded for the present ondemocracy and hustings operations, and giving to all life the aspectof a chivalrous battle-field, or almost of a gay though periloustournament, and bout of "A hundred knights against all comers,"--wasmaintained by Sterling and his friends.  And in fine, after whateverloud remonstrances, and solemn considerations, and such shaking of ourwigs as is undoubtedly natural in the case, let us be just to it andhim.  We shall have to admit, nay it will behoove us to see andpractically know, for ourselves and him and others, that the essenceof this creed, in times like ours, was right and not wrong.  That,however the ground and form of it might change, essentially it was themonition of his natal genius to this as it is to every brave man; thebehest of all his clear insight into this Universe, the message ofHeaven through him, which he could not suppress, but was inspired andcompelled to utter in this world by such methods as he had.  There forhim lay the first commandment; _this_ is what it would have been theunforgivable sin to swerve from and desert:  the treason of treasonsfor him, it were there; compared with which all other sins are venial!The message did not cease at all, as we shall see; the message wasardently, if fitfully, continued to the end:  but the methods, thetone and dialect and all outer conditions of uttering it, underwentmost important modifications!CHAPTER VIII.COLERIDGE.Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, lookingdown on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from theinanity of life's battle; attracting towards him the thoughts ofinnumerable brave souls still engaged there.  His expresscontributions to poetry, philosophy, or any specific province of humanliterature or enlightenment, had been small and sadly intermittent;but he had, especially among young inquiring men, a higher thanliterary, a kind of prophetic or magician character.  He was thoughtto hold, he alone in England, the key of German and otherTranscendentalisms; knew the sublime secret of believing by "thereason" what "the understanding" had been obliged to fling out asincredible; and could still, after Hume and Voltaire had done theirbest and worst with him, profess himself an orthodox Christian, andsay and print to the Church of England, with its singular old rubricsand surplices at Allhallowtide, _Esto perpetua_.  A sublime man; who,alone in those dark days, had saved his crown of spiritual manhood;escaping from the black materialisms, and revolutionary deluges, with"God, Freedom, Immortality" still his:  a king of men.  The practicalintellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckonedhim a metaphysical dreamer:  but to the rising spirits of the younggeneration he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as akind of _Magus_, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove (Mr.Gilman's house at Highgate) whispering strange things, uncertainwhether oracles or jargon.The Gilmans did not encourage much company, or excitation of any sort,round their sage; nevertheless access to him, if a youth didreverently wish it, was not difficult.  He would stroll about thepleasant garden with you, sit in the pleasant rooms of theplace,--perhaps take you to his own peculiar room, high up, with arearward view, which was the chief view of all.  A really charmingoutlook, in fine weather.  Close at hand, wide sweep of flowery leafygardens, their few houses mostly hidden, the very chimney-pots veiledunder blossomy umbrage, flowed gloriously down hill; gloriouslyissuing in wide-tufted undulating plain-country, rich in all charms offield and town.  Waving blooming country of the brightest green;dotted all over with handsome villas, handsome groves; crossed byroads and human traffic, here inaudible or heard only as a musicalhum:  and behind all swam, under olive-tinted haze, the illimitablelimitary ocean of London, with its domes and steeples definite in thesun, big Paul's and the many memories attached to it hanging high overall.  Nowhere, of its kind, could you see a grander prospect on abright summer day, with the set of the air goingsouthward,--southward, and so draping with the city-smoke not you butthe city.  Here for hours would Coleridge talk, concerning allconceivable or inconceivable things; and liked nothing better than tohave an intelligent, or failing that, even a silent and patient humanlistener.  He distinguished himself to all that ever heard him as atleast the most surprising talker extant in this world,--and to somesmall minority, by no means to all, as the most excellent.The good man, he was now getting old, towards sixty perhaps; and gaveyou the idea of a life that had been full of sufferings; a lifeheavy-laden, half-vanquished, still swimming painfully in seas ofmanifold physical and other bewilderment.  Brow and head were round,and of massive weight, but the face was flabby and irresolute.  Thedeep eyes, of a light hazel, were as full of sorrow as of inspiration;confused pain looked mildly from them, as in a kind of mildastonishment.  The whole figure and air, good and amiable otherwise,might be called flabby and irresolute; expressive of weakness underpossibility of strength.  He hung loosely on his limbs, with kneesbent, and stooping attitude; in walking, he rather shuffled thandecisively steps; and a lady once remarked, he never could fix whichside of the garden walk would suit him best, but continually shifted,in corkscrew fashion, and kept trying both.  A heavy-laden,high-aspiring and surely much-suffering man.  His voice, naturallysoft and good, had contracted itself into a plaintive snuffle andsingsong; he spoke as if preaching,--you would have said, preachingearnestly and also hopelessly the weightiest things.  I stillrecollect his "object" and "subject," terms of continual recurrence inthe Kantean province; and how he sang and snuffled them into"om-m-mject" and "sum-m-mject," with a kind of solemn shake or quaver,as he rolled along.  No talk, in his century or in any other, could bemore surprising.Sterling, who assiduously attended him, with profound reverence, andwas often with him by himself, for a good many months, gives a recordof their first colloquy.[8]  Their colloquies were numerous, and hehad taken note of many; but they are all gone to the fire, except thisfirst, which Mr. Hare has printed,--unluckily without date.  Itcontains a number of ingenious, true and half-true observations, andis of course a faithful epitome of the things said; but it gives smallidea of Coleridge's way of talking;--this one feature is perhaps themost recognizable, "Our interview lasted for three hours, during whichhe talked two hours and three quarters."  Nothing could be morecopious than his talk; and furthermore it was always, virtually orliterally, of the nature of a monologue; suffering no interruption,however reverent; hastily putting aside all foreign additions,annotations, or most ingenuous desires for elucidation, as well-meantsuperfluities which would never do.  Besides, it was talk not flowingany-whither like a river, but spreading every-whither in inextricablecurrents and regurgitations like a lake or sea; terribly deficient indefinite goal or aim, nay often in logical intelligibility; _what_ youwere to believe or do, on any earthly or heavenly thing, obstinatelyrefusing to appear from it.  So that, most times, you felt logicallylost; swamped near to drowning in this tide of ingenious vocables,spreading out boundless as if to submerge the world.To sit as a passive bucket and be pumped into, whether you consent ornot, can in the long-run be exhilarating to no creature; how eloquentsoever the flood of utterance that is descending.  But if it be withala confused unintelligible flood of utterance, threatening to submergeall known landmarks of thought, and drown the world and you!--I haveheard Coleridge talk, with eager musical energy, two stricken hours,his face radiant and moist, and communicate no meaning whatsoever toany individual of his hearers,--certain of whom, I for one, still kepteagerly listening in hope; the most had long before given up, andformed (if the room were large enough) secondary humming groups oftheir own.  He began anywhere:  you put some question to him, madesome suggestive observation:  instead of answering this, or decidedlysetting out towards answer of it, he would accumulate formidableapparatus, logical swim-bladders, transcendental life-preservers andother precautionary and vehiculatory gear, for setting out; perhapsdid at last get under way,--but was swiftly solicited, turned aside bythe glance of some radiant new game on this hand or that, into newcourses; and ever into new; and before long into all the Universe,where it was uncertain what game you would catch, or whether any.His talk, alas, was distinguished, like himself, by irresolution:  itdisliked to he troubled with conditions, abstinences, definitefulfilments;--loved to wander at its own sweet will, and make itsauditor and his claims and humble wishes a mere passive bucket foritself!  He had knowledge about many things and topics, much curiousreading; but generally all topics led him, after a pass or two, intothe high seas of theosophic philosophy, the hazy infinitude of Kanteantranscendentalism, with its "sum-m-mjects " and " om-m-mjects."  Sadenough; for with such indolent impatience of the claims and ignorancesof others, he had not the least talent for explaining this or anythingunknown to them; and you swam and fluttered in the mistiest wideunintelligible deluge of things, for most part in a rather profitlessuncomfortable manner.Glorious islets, too, I have seen rise out of the haze; but they werefew, and soon swallowed in the general element again.  Balmy sunnyislets, islets of the blest and the intelligible:--on which occasionsthose secondary humming groups would all cease humming, and hangbreathless upon the eloquent words; till once your islet got wrapt inthe mist again, and they could recommence humming.  Eloquentartistically expressive words you always had; piercing radiances of amost subtle insight came at intervals; tones of noble pious sympathy,recognizable as pious though strangely colored, were never wantinglong:  but in general you could not call this aimless, cloud-capt,cloud-based, lawlessly meandering human discourse of reason by thename of "excellent talk," but only of "surprising;" and were remindedbitterly of Hazlitt's account of it:  "Excellent talker, very,--if youlet him start from no premises and come to no conclusion."  Coleridgewas not without what talkers call wit, and there were touches ofprickly sarcasm in him, contemptuous enough of the world and its idolsand popular dignitaries; he had traits even of poetic humor:  but ingeneral he seemed deficient in laughter; or indeed in sympathy forconcrete human things either on the sunny or on the stormy side.  Oneright peal of concrete laughter at some convicted flesh-and-bloodabsurdity, one burst of noble indignation at some injustice ordepravity, rubbing elbows with us on this solid Earth, how strangewould it have been in that Kantean haze-world, and how infinitelycheering amid its vacant air-castles and dim-melting ghosts andshadows!  None such ever came.  His life had been an abstract thinkingand dreaming, idealistic, passed amid the ghosts of defunct bodies andof unborn ones.  The moaning singsong of that theosophico-metaphysicalmonotony left on you, at last, a very dreary feeling.In close colloquy, flowing within narrower banks, I suppose he wasmore definite and apprehensible; Sterling in after-times did notcomplain of his unintelligibility, or imputed it only to the abtrusehigh nature of the topics handled.  Let us hope so, let us try tobelieve so!  There is no doubt but Coleridge could speak plain wordson things plain:  his observations and responses on the trivialmatters that occurred were as simple as the commonest man's, or wereeven distinguished by superior simplicity as well as pertinency.  "Ah,your tea is too cold, Mr. Coleridge!" mourned the good Mrs. Gilmanonce, in her kind, reverential and yet protective manner, handing hima very tolerable though belated cup.--"It's better than I deserve!"snuffled he, in a low hoarse murmur, partly courteous, chiefly pious,the tone of which still abides with me:  "It's better than I deserve!"But indeed, to the young ardent mind, instinct with pious nobleness,yet driven to the grim deserts of Radicalism for a faith, hisspeculations had a charm much more than literary, a charm almostreligious and prophetic.  The constant gist of his discourse waslamentation over the sunk condition of the world; which he recognizedto be given up to Atheism and Materialism, full of mere sordidmisbeliefs, mispursuits and misresults.  All Science had becomemechanical; the science not of men, but of a kind of human beavers.Churches themselves had died away into a godless mechanical condition;and stood there as mere Cases of Articles, mere Forms of Churches;like the dried carcasses of once swift camels, which you find leftwithering in the thirst of the universal desert,--ghastly portents forthe present, beneficent ships of the desert no more.  Men's souls wereblinded, hebetated; and sunk under the influence of Atheism andMaterialism, and Hume and Voltaire:  the world for the present was asan extinct world, deserted of God, and incapable of well-doing till itchanged its heart and spirit.  This, expressed I think with less ofindignation and with more of long-drawn querulousness, was alwaysrecognizable as the ground-tone:--in which truly a pious young heart,driven into Radicalism and the opposition party, could not butrecognize a too sorrowful truth; and ask of the Oracle, with allearnestness, What remedy, then?The remedy, though Coleridge himself professed to see it as insunbeams, could not, except by processes unspeakably difficult, bedescribed to you at all.  On the whole, those dead Churches, this deadEnglish Church especially, must be brought to life again.  Why not?It was not dead; the soul of it, in this parched-up body, wastragically asleep only.  Atheistic Philosophy was true on its side,and Hume and Voltaire could on their own ground speak irrefragably forthemselves against any Church:  but lift the Church and them into ahigher sphere.  Of argument, _they_ died into inanition, the Churchrevivified itself into pristine florid vigor,--became once more aliving ship of the desert, and invincibly bore you over stock andstone.  But how, but how!  By attending to the "reason" of man, saidColeridge, and duly chaining up the "understanding" of man:  the_Vernunft_ (Reason) and _Verstand_ (Understanding) of the Germans, itall turned upon these, if you could well understand them,--which youcouldn't.  For the rest, Mr. Coleridge had on the anvil various Books,especially was about to write one grand Book _On the Logos_, whichwould help to bridge the chasm for us.  So much appeared, however:Churches, though proved false (as you had imagined), were still true(as you were to imagine):  here was an Artist who could burn you up anold Church, root and branch; and then as the Alchemists professed todo with organic substances in general, distil you an "Astral Spirit"from the ashes, which was the very image of the old burnt article, itsair-drawn counterpart,--this you still had, or might get, and drawuses from, if you could.  Wait till the Book on the Logos weredone;--alas, till your own terrene eyes, blind with conceit and thedust of logic, were purged, subtilized and spiritualized into thesharpness of vision requisite for discerning such an"om-m-mject."--The ingenuous young English head, of those days, stoodstrangely puzzled by such revelations; uncertain whether it weregetting inspired, or getting infatuated into flat imbecility; andstrange effulgence, of new day or else of deeper meteoric night,colored the horizon of the future for it.Let me not be unjust to this memorable man.  Surely there was here, inhis pious, ever-laboring, subtle mind, a precious truth, orprefigurement of truth; and yet a fatal delusion withal.Prefigurement that, in spite of beaver sciences and temporaryspiritual hebetude and cecity, man and his Universe were eternallydivine; and that no past nobleness, or revelation of the divine, couldor would ever be lost to him.  Most true, surely, and worthy of allacceptance.  Good also to do what you can with old Churches andpractical Symbols of the Noble:  nay quit not the burnt ruins of themwhile you find there is still gold to be dug there.  But, on thewhole, do not think you can, by logical alchemy, distil astral spiritsfrom them; or if you could, that said astral spirits, or defunctlogical phantasms, could serve you in anything.  What the light ofyour mind, which is the direct inspiration of the Almighty, pronouncesincredible,--that, in God's name, leave uncredited; at your peril donot try believing that.  No subtlest hocus-pocus of "reason" versus"understanding" will avail for that feat;--and it is terribly perilousto try it in these provinces!The truth is, I now see, Coleridge's talk and speculation was theemblem of himself:  in it as in him, a ray of heavenly inspirationstruggled, in a tragically ineffectual degree, with the weakness offlesh and blood.  He says once, he "had skirted the howling deserts ofInfidelity;" this was evident enough:  but he had not had the courage,in defiance of pain and terror, to press resolutely across saiddeserts to the new firm lands of Faith beyond; he preferred to createlogical fata-morganas for himself on this hither side, and laboriouslysolace himself with these.To the man himself Nature had given, in high measure, the seeds of anoble endowment; and to unfold it had been forbidden him.  A subtlelynx-eyed intellect, tremulous pious sensibility to all good and allbeautiful; truly a ray of empyrean light;--but embedded in such weaklaxity of character, in such indolences and esuriences as had madestrange work with it.  Once more, the tragic story of a high endowmentwith an insufficient will.  An eye to discern the divineness of theHeaven's spendors and lightnings, the insatiable wish to revel intheir godlike radiances and brilliances; but no heart to front thescathing terrors of them, which is the first condition of yourconquering an abiding place there.  The courage necessary for him,above all things, had been denied this man.  His life, with such rayof the empyrean in it, was great and terrible to him; and he had notvaliantly grappled with it, he had fled from it; sought refuge invague daydreams, hollow compromises, in opium, in theosophicmetaphysics.  Harsh pain, danger, necessity, slavish harnessed toil,were of all things abhorrent to him.  And so the empyrean element,lying smothered under the terrene, and yet inextinguishable there,made sad writhings.  For pain, danger, difficulty, steady slavingtoil, and other highly disagreeable behests of destiny, shall innowise be shirked by any brightest mortal that will approve himselfloyal to his mission in this world; nay precisely the higher he is,the deeper will be the disagreeableness, and the detestability toflesh and blood, of the tasks laid on him; and the heavier too, andmore tragic, his penalties if he neglect them.For the old Eternal Powers do live forever; nor do their laws know anychange, however we in our poor wigs and church-tippets may attempt toread their laws.  To _steal_ into Heaven,--by the modern method, ofsticking ostrich-like your head into fallacies on Earth, equally as bythe ancient and by all conceivable methods,--is forever forbidden.High-treason is the name of that attempt; and it continues to bepunished as such.  Strange enough:  here once more was a kind ofHeaven-scaling Ixion; and to him, as to the old one, the just godswere very stern!  The ever-revolving, never-advancing Wheel (of akind) was his, through life; and from his Cloud-Juno did not he tooprocreate strange Centaurs, spectral Puseyisms, monstrous illusoryHybrids, and ecclesiastical Chimeras,--which now roam the earth in avery lamentable manner!CHAPTER IX.SPANISH EXILES.This magical ingredient thrown into the wild caldron of such a mind,which we have seen occupied hitherto with mere Ethnicism, Radicalismand revolutionary tumult, but hungering all along for something higherand better, was sure to be eagerly welcomed and imbibed, and could notfail to produce important fermentations there.  Fermentations;important new directions, and withal important new perversions, in thespiritual life of this man, as it has since done in the lives of somany.  Here then is the new celestial manna we were all in quest of?This thrice-refined pabulum of transcendental moonshine?  Whoso eateththereof,--yes, what, on the whole, will _he_ probably grow to?Sterling never spoke much to me of his intercourse with Coleridge; andwhen we did compare notes about him, it was usually rather in the wayof controversial discussion than of narrative.  So that, from my ownresources, I can give no details of the business, nor specify anythingin it, except the general fact of an ardent attendance at Highgatecontinued for many months, which was impressively known to allSterling's friends; and am unable to assign even the limitary dates,Sterling's own papers on the subject having all been destroyed by him.Inferences point to the end of 1828 as the beginning of thisintercourse; perhaps in 1829 it was at the highest point; and alreadyin 1830, when the intercourse itself was about to terminate, we haveproof of the influences it was producing,--in the Novel of _ArthurConingsby_, then on hand, the first and only Book that Sterling everwrote.  His writings hitherto had been sketches, criticisms, briefessays; he was now trying it on a wider scale; but not yet withsatisfactory results, and it proved to be his only trial in that form.He had already, as was intimated, given up his brief proprietorship ofthe _Athenaeum_; the commercial indications, and state of sales and ofcosts, peremptorily ordering him to do so; the copyright went by saleor gift, I know not at what precise date, into other fitter hands; andwith the copyright all connection on the part of Sterling.  To_Athenaeum_ Sketches had now (in 1829-30) succeeded _ArthurConingsby_, a Novel in three volumes; indicating (when it came tolight, a year or two afterwards) equally hasty and much more ambitiousaims in Literature;--giving strong evidence, too, of internalspiritual revulsions going painfully forward, and in particular of theimpression Coleridge was producing on him.  Without and within, it wasa wild tide of things this ardent light young soul was afloat upon, atpresent; and his outlooks into the future, whether for his spiritualor economic fortunes, were confused enough.Among his familiars in this period, I might have mentioned one CharlesBarton, formerly his fellow-student at Cambridge, now an amiable,cheerful, rather idle young fellow about Town; who led the way intocertain new experiences, and lighter fields, for Sterling.  HisFather, Lieutenant-General Barton of the Life-guards, an Irishlandlord, I think in Fermanagh County, and a man of connections aboutCourt, lived in a certain figure here in Town; had a wife offashionable habits, with other sons, and also daughters, bred in thissphere.  These, all of them, were amiable, elegant and pleasantpeople;--such was especially an eldest daughter, Susannah Barton, astately blooming black-eyed young woman, attractive enough in form andcharacter; full of gay softness, of indolent sense and enthusiasm;about Sterling's own age, if not a little older.  In this house, whichopened to him, more decisively than his Father's, a new stratum ofsociety, and where his reception for Charles's sake and his own was ofthe kindest, he liked very well to be; and spent, I suppose, many ofhis vacant half-hours, lightly chatting with the elders or theyoungsters,--doubtless with the young lady too, though as yet withoutparticular intentions on either side.Nor, with all the Coleridge fermentation, was democratic Radicalism byany means given up;--though how it was to live if the Coleridgeanmoonshine took effect, might have been an abtruse question.  Hitherto,while said moonshine was but taking effect, and coloring the outersurface of things without quite penetrating into the heart, democraticLiberalism, revolt against superstition and oppression, and help towhosoever would revolt, was still the grand element in Sterling'screed; and practically he stood, not ready only, but full of alacrityto fulfil all its behests.  We heard long since of the "blackdragoons,"--whom doubtless the new moonshine had considerablysilvered-over into new hues, by this time;--but here now, whileRadicalism is tottering for him and threatening to crumble, comessuddenly the grand consummation and explosion of Radicalism in hislife; whereby, all at once, Radicalism exhausted and ended itself, andappeared no more there.In those years a visible section of the London population, andconspicuous out of all proportion to its size or value, was a smallknot of Spaniards, who had sought shelter here as Political Refugees."Political Refugees:"  a tragic succession of that class is one of thepossessions of England in our time.  Six-and-twenty years ago, when Ifirst saw London, I remember those unfortunate Spaniards among the newphenomena.  Daily in the cold spring air, under skies so unlike theirown, you could see a group of fifty or a hundred stately tragicfigures, in proud threadbare cloaks; perambulating, mostly with closedlips, the broad pavements of Euston Square and the regions about St.Pancras new Church.  Their lodging was chiefly in Somers Town, as Iunderstood:  and those open pavements about St. Pancras Church werethe general place of rendezvous.  They spoke little or no English;knew nobody, could employ themselves on nothing, in this new scene.Old steel-gray heads, many of them; the shaggy, thick, blue-black hairof others struck you; their brown complexion, dusky look of suppressedfire, in general their tragic condition as of caged Numidian lions.That particular Flight of Unfortunates has long since fled again, andvanished; and new have come and fled.  In this convulsed revolutionaryepoch, which already lasts above sixty years, what tragic flights ofsuch have we not seen arrive on the one safe coast which is open tothem, as they get successively vanquished, and chased into exile toavoid worse!  Swarm after swarm, of ever-new complexion, from Spain asfrom other countries, is thrown off, in those ever-recurringparoxysms; and will continue to be thrown off.  As there could be(suggests Linnaeus) a "flower-clock," measuring the hours of the day,and the months of the year, by the kinds of flowers that go to sleepand awaken, that blow into beauty and fade into dust:  so in the greatRevolutionary Horologe, one might mark the years and epochs by thesuccessive kinds of exiles that walk London streets, and, in grimsilent manner, demand pity from us and reflections from us.--This thenextant group of Spanish Exiles was the Trocadero swarm, thrown off in1823, in the Riego and Quirogas quarrel.  These were they whom CharlesTenth had, by sheer force, driven from their constitutionalisms andtheir Trocadero fortresses,--Charles Tenth, who himself was soondriven out, manifoldly by sheer force; and had to head his own swarmof fugitives; and has now himself quite vanished, and given place toothers.  For there is no end of them; propelling and propelled!--Of these poor Spanish Exiles, now vegetating about Somers Town, andpainfully beating the pavement in Euston Square, the acknowledgedchief was General Torrijos, a man of high qualities and fortunes,still in the vigor of his years, and in these desperate circumstancesrefusing to despair; with whom Sterling had, at this time, becomeintimate.CHAPTER X.TORRIJOS.Torrijos, who had now in 1829 been here some four or five years,having come over in 1824, had from the first enjoyed a superiorreception in England.  Possessing not only a language to speak, whichfew of the others did, but manifold experiences courtly, military,diplomatic, with fine natural faculties, and high Spanish mannerstempered into cosmopolitan, he had been welcomed in various circles ofsociety; and found, perhaps he alone of those Spaniards, a certainhuman companionship among persons of some standing in this country.With the elder Sterlings, among others, he had made acquaintance;became familiar in the social circle at South Place, and was muchesteemed there.  With Madam Torrijos, who also was a person of amiableand distinguished qualities, an affectionate friendship grew up on thepart of Mrs. Sterling, which ended only with the death of these twoladies.  John Sterling, on arriving in London from his Universitywork, naturally inherited what he liked to take up of this relation:and in the lodgings in Regent Street, and the democratico-literaryelement there, Torrijos became a very prominent, and at length almostthe central object.The man himself, it is well known, was a valiant, gallant man; oflively intellect, of noble chivalrous character:  fine talents, fineaccomplishments, all grounding themselves on a certain ruggedveracity, recommended him to the discerning.  He had begun youth inthe Court of Ferdinand; had gone on in Wellington and other arduous,victorious and unvictorious, soldierings; familiar in camps andcouncil-rooms, in presence-chambers and in prisons.  He knew romanticSpain;--he was himself, standing withal in the vanguard of Freedom'sfight, a kind of living romance.  Infinitely interesting to JohnSterling, for one.It was to Torrijos that the poor Spaniards of Somers Town lookedmainly, in their helplessness, for every species of help.  Torrijos,it was hoped, would yet lead them into Spain and glorious victorythere; meanwhile here in England, under defeat, he was their captainand sovereign in another painfully inverse sense.  To whom, inextremity, everybody might apply.  When all present resources failed,and the exchequer was quite out, there still remained Torrijos.Torrijos has to find new resources for his destitute patriots, findloans, find Spanish lessons for them among his English friends:  inall which charitable operations, it need not be said, John Sterlingwas his foremost man; zealous to empty his own purse for the object;impetuous in rushing hither or thither to enlist the aid of others,and find lessons or something that would do.  His friends, of course,had to assist; the Bartons, among others, were wont to assist;--and Ihave heard that the fair Susan, stirring up her indolent enthusiasminto practicality, was very successful in finding Spanish lessons, andthe like, for these distressed men.  Sterling and his friends were yetnew in this business; but Torrijos and the others were getting old init?--and doubtless weary and almost desperate of it.  They had nowbeen seven years in it, many of them; and were asking, When will theend be?Torrijos is described as a man of excellent discernment:  who knowshow long he had repressed the unreasonable schemes of his followers,and turned a deaf ear to the temptings of fallacious hope?  But therecomes at length a sum-total of oppressive burdens which isintolerable, which tempts the wisest towards fallacies for relief.These weary groups, pacing the Euston-Square pavements, had often saidin their despair, "Were not death in battle better?  Here are weslowly mouldering into nothingness; there we might reach it rapidly,in flaming splendor.  Flame, either of victory to Spain and us, or ofa patriot death, the sure harbinger of victory to Spain.  Flame fit tokindle a fire which no Ferdinand, with all his Inquisitions andCharles Tenths, could put out."  Enough, in the end of 1829, Torrijoshimself had yielded to this pressure; and hoping against hope,persuaded himself that if he could but land in the South of Spain witha small patriot band well armed and well resolved, a band carryingfire in its heart,--then Spain, all inflammable as touchwood, andgroaning indignantly under its brutal tyrant, might blaze wholly intoflame round him, and incalculable victory be won.  Such was hisconclusion; not sudden, yet surely not deliberate either,--desperaterather, and forced on by circumstances.  He thought with himself that,considering Somers Town and considering Spain, the terrible chance wasworth trying; that this big game of Fate, go how it might, was onewhich the omens credibly declared he and these poor Spaniards ought toplay.His whole industries and energies were thereupon bent towards startingthe said game; and his thought and continual speech and song now was,That if he had a few thousand pounds to buy arms, to freight a shipand make the other preparations, he and these poor gentlemen, andSpain and the world, were made men and a saved Spain and world.  Whattalks and consultations in the apartment in Regent Street, duringthose winter days of 1829-30; setting into open conflagration theyoung democracy that was wont to assemble there!  Of which there isnow left next to no remembrance.  For Sterling never spoke a word ofthis affair in after-days, nor was any of the actors much tempted tospeak.  We can understand too well that here were young fervid heartsin an explosive condition; young rash heads, sanctioned by a man'sexperienced head.  Here at last shall enthusiasm and theory becomepractice and fact; fiery dreams are at last permitted to realizethemselves; and now is the time or never!--How the Coleridge moonshinecomported itself amid these hot telluric flames, or whether it had notyet begun to play there (which I rather doubt), must be left toconjecture.Mr. Hare speaks of Sterling "sailing over to St. Valery in an openboat along with others," upon one occasion, in this enterprise;--inthe _final_ English scene of it, I suppose.  Which is very possible.Unquestionably there was adventure enough of other kinds for it, andrunning to and fro with all his speed on behalf of it, during thesemonths of his history!  Money was subscribed, collected:  the youngCambridge democrats were all ablaze to assist Torrijos; nay certain ofthem decided to go with him,--and went.  Only, as yet, the funds wererather incomplete.  And here, as I learn from a good hand, is thesecret history of their becoming complete.  Which, as we are upon thesubject, I had better give.  But for the following circumstance, theyhad perhaps never been completed; nor had the rash enterprise, or itscatastrophe, so influential on the rest of Sterling's life, takenplace at all.A certain Lieutenant Robert Boyd, of the Indian Army, an UlsterIrishman, a cousin of Sterling's, had received some affront, orotherwise taken some disgust in that service; had thrown up hiscommission in consequence; and returned home, about this time, withintent to seek another course of life.  Having only, for outfit, theseimpatient ardors, some experience in Indian drill exercise, and fivethousand pounds of inheritance, he found the enterprise attended withdifficulties; and was somewhat at a loss how to dispose of himself.Some young Ulster comrade, in a partly similar situation, had pointedout to him that there lay in a certain neighboring creek of the Irishcoast, a worn-out royal gun-brig condemned to sale, to be haddog-cheap:  this he proposed that they two, or in fact Boyd with hisfive thousand pounds, should buy; that they should refit and arm andman it;--and sail a-privateering "to the Eastern Archipelago,"Philippine Isles, or I know not where; and _so_ conquer the goldenfleece.Boyd naturally paused a little at this great proposal; did not quitereject it; came across, with it and other fine projects andimpatiences fermenting in his head, to London, there to see andconsider.  It was in the months when the Torrijos enterprise was inthe birth-throes; crying wildly for capital, of all things.  Boydnaturally spoke of his projects to Sterling,--of his gun-brig lying inthe Irish creek, among others.  Sterling naturally said, "If you wantan adventure of the Sea-king sort, and propose to lay your money andyour life into such a game, here is Torrijos and Spain at his back;here is a golden fleece to conquer, worth twenty EasternArchipelagoes."--Boyd and Torrijos quickly met; quickly bargained.Boyd's money was to go in purchasing, and storing with a certain stockof arms and etceteras, a small ship in the Thames, which should carryBoyd with Torrijos and the adventurers to the south coast of Spain;and there, the game once played and won, Boyd was to have promotionenough,--"the colonelcy of a Spanish cavalry regiment," for oneexpress thing.  What exact share Sterling had in this negotiation, orwhether he did not even take the prudent side and caution Boyd to bewary I know not; but it was he that brought the parties together; andall his friends knew, in silence, that to the end of his life hepainfully remembered that fact.And so a ship was hired, or purchased, in the Thames; due furnishingsbegan to be executed in it; arms and stores were gradually got onboard; Torrijos with his Fifty picked Spaniards, in the mean while,getting ready.  This was in the spring of 1830.  Boyd's 5000 poundswas the grand nucleus of finance; but vigorous subscription wascarried on likewise in Sterling's young democratic circle, or wherevera member of it could find access; not without considerable result, andwith a zeal that may be imagined.  Nay, as above hinted, certain ofthese young men decided, not to give their money only, but themselvesalong with it, as democratic volunteers and soldiers of progress;among whom, it need not be said, Sterling intended to be foremost.Busy weeks with him, those spring ones of the year 1830!  Through thissmall Note, accidentally preserved to us, addressed to his friendBarton, we obtain a curious glance into the subterranean workshop:--        "_To Charles Barton, Esq., Dorset Sq., Regent's Park_.                        [No date; apparently March or February, 1830.]"MY DEAR CHARLES,--I have wanted to see you to talk to you about myForeign affairs.  If you are going to be in London for a few days, Ibelieve you can be very useful to me, at a considerable expense andtrouble to yourself, in the way of buying accoutrements; _inter alia_,a sword and a saddle,--not, you will understand, for my own use."Things are going on very well, but are very, even frightfully near;only be quiet!  Pray would you, in case of necessity, take a freepassage to Holland, next week or the week after; stay two or threedays, and come back, all expenses paid?  If you write to B---- atCambridge, tell him above all things to hold his tongue.  If you arenear Palace Yard to-morrow before two, pray come to see me.  Do notcome on purpose; especially as I may perhaps be away, and at allevents shall not be there until eleven, nor perhaps till rather later."I fear I shall have alarmed your Mother by my irruption.  Forgive mefor that and all my exactions from you.  If the next month were over,I should not have to trouble any one.                        "Yours affectionately,                                                        "J. STERLING."Busy weeks indeed; and a glowing smithy-light coming through thechinks!--The romance of _Arthur Coningsby_ lay written, orhalf-written, in his desk; and here, in his heart and among his hands,was an acted romance and unknown catastrophes keeping pace with that.Doubts from the doctors, for his health was getting ominous, threwsome shade over the adventure.  Reproachful reminiscences of Coleridgeand Theosophy were natural too; then fond regrets for Literature andits glories:  if you act your romance, how can you also write it?Regrets, and reproachful reminiscences, from Art and Theosophy;perhaps some tenderer regrets withal.  A crisis in life had come;when, of innumerable possibilities one possibility was to be electedking, and to swallow all the rest, the rest of course made noiseenough, and swelled themselves to their biggest.Meanwhile the ship was fast getting ready:  on a certain day, it wasto drop quietly down the Thames; then touch at Deal, and take on boardTorrijos and his adventurers, who were to be in waiting and on theoutlook for them there.  Let every man lay in his accoutrements, then;let every man make his packages, his arrangements and farewells.Sterling went to take leave of Miss Barton.  "You are going, then; toSpain?  To rough it amid the storms of war and perilous insurrection;and with that weak health of yours; and--we shall never see you more,then!"  Miss Barton, all her gayety gone, the dimpling softness becomeliquid sorrow, and the musical ringing voice one wail of woe, "burstinto tears,"--so I have it on authority:--here was one possibilityabout to be strangled that made unexpected noise!  Sterling'sinterview ended in the offer of his hand, and the acceptance ofit;--any sacrifice to get rid of this horrid Spanish business, andsave the health and life of a gifted young man so precious to theworld and to another!"Ill-health," as often afterwards in Sterling's life, when the excusewas real enough but not the chief excuse; "ill-health, and insuperableobstacles and engagements," had to bear the chief brunt inapologizing:  and, as Sterling's actual presence, or that of anyEnglishman except Boyd and his money, was not in the least vital tothe adventure, his excuse was at once accepted.  The Englishconnections and subscriptions are a given fact, to be presided over bywhat English volunteers there are:  and as for Englishmen, the fewerEnglishmen that go, the larger will be the share of influence foreach.  The other adventurers, Torrijos among them in due readiness,moved silently one by one down to Deal; Sterling, superintending thenaval hands, on board their ship in the Thames, was to see the lastfinish given to everything in that department; then, on the setevening, to drop down quietly to Deal, and there say _Andad con Dios_,and return.Behold!  Just before the set evening came, the Spanish Envoy at thisCourt has got notice of what is going on; the Spanish Envoy, and ofcourse the British Foreign Secretary, and of course also the ThamesPolice.  Armed men spring suddenly on board, one day, while Sterlingis there; declare the ship seized and embargoed in the King's name;nobody on board to stir till he has given some account of himself indue time and place!  Huge consternation, naturally, from stem tostern.  Sterling, whose presence of mind seldom forsook him, casts hiseye over the River and its craft; sees a wherry, privately signals it,drops rapidly on board of it:  "Stop!" fiercely interjects the marinepoliceman from the ship's deck.--"Why stop?  What use have you for me,or I for you?" and the oars begin playing.--"Stop, or I'll shoot you!"cries the marine policeman, drawing a pistol.--"No, you won't."--"Iwill!"--"If you do you'll be hanged at the next Maidstone assizes,then; that's all,"--and Sterling's wherry shot rapidly ashore; and outof this perilous adventure.That same night he posted down to Deal; disclosed to the Torrijosparty what catastrophe had come.  No passage Spainward from theThames; well if arrestment do not suddenly come from the Thames!  Itwas on this occasion, I suppose, that the passage in the open boat toSt. Valery occurred;--speedy flight in what boat or boats, open orshut, could be got at Deal on the sudden.  Sterling himself, accordingto Hare's authority, actually went with them so far.  Enough, they gotshipping, as private passengers in one craft or the other; and, bydegrees or at once, arrived all at Gibraltar,--Boyd, one or two youngdemocrats of Regent Street, the fifty picked Spaniards, andTorrijos,--safe, though without arms; still in the early part of theyear.CHAPTER XI.MARRIAGE:  ILL-HEALTH; WEST-INDIES.Sterling's outlooks and occupations, now that his Spanish friends weregone, must have been of a rather miscellaneous confused description.He had the enterprise of a married life close before him; and as yetno profession, no fixed pursuit whatever.  His health was already verythreatening; often such as to disable him from present activity, andoccasion the gravest apprehensions; practically blocking up allimportant courses whatsoever, and rendering the future, if even lifewere lengthened and he had any future, an insolubility for him.Parliament was shut, public life was shut:  Literature,--if, alas, anysolid fruit could lie in literature!Or perhaps one's health would mend, after all; and many things bebetter than was hoped!  Sterling was not of a despondent temper, orgiven in any measure to lie down and indolently moan:  I fancy hewalked briskly enough into this tempestuous-looking future; notheeding too much its thunderous aspects; doing swiftly, for the day,what his hand found to do.  _Arthur Coningsby_, I suppose, lay on theanvil at present; visits to Coleridge were now again more possible;grand news from Torrijos might be looked for, though only small yetcame:--nay here, in the hot July, is France, at least, all thrown intovolcano again!  Here are the miraculous Three Days; heralding, inthunder, great things to Torrijos and others; filling with babblementand vaticination the mouths and hearts of all democratic men.So rolled along, in tumult of chaotic remembrance and uncertain hope,in manifold emotion, and the confused struggle (for Sterling as forthe world) to extricate the New from the falling ruins of the Old, thesummer and autumn of 1830.  From Gibraltar and Torrijos the tidingswere vague, unimportant and discouraging:  attempt on Cadiz, attempton the lines of St. Roch, those attempts, or rather resolutions toattempt, had died in the birth, or almost before it.  Men blamedTorrijos, little knowing his impediments.  Boyd was still patient athis post:  others of the young English (on the strength of thesubscribed moneys) were said to be thinking of tours,--perhaps in theSierra Morena and neighboring Quixote regions.  From that Torrijosenterprise it did not seem that anything considerable would come.On the edge of winter, here at home, Sterling was married:  "atChristchurch, Marylebone, 2d November, 1830," say the records.  Hisblooming, kindly and true-hearted Wife had not much money, nor had heas yet any:  but friends on both sides were bountiful and hopeful; hadmade up, for the young couple, the foundations of a modestly effectivehousehold; and in the future there lay more substantial prospects.  Onthe finance side Sterling never had anything to suffer.  His Wife,though somewhat languid, and of indolent humor, was a graceful,pious-minded, honorable and affectionate woman; she could not muchsupport him in the ever-shifting struggles of his life, but shefaithfully attended him in them, and loyally marched by his sidethrough the changes and nomadic pilgrimings, of which many wereappointed him in his short course.Unhappily a few weeks after his marriage, and before any household wasyet set up, he fell dangerously ill; worse in health than he had everyet been:  so many agitations crowded into the last few months hadbeen too much for him.  He fell into dangerous pulmonary illness, sankever deeper; lay for many weeks in his Father's house utterlyprostrate, his young Wife and his Mother watching over him; friends,sparingly admitted, long despairing of his life.  All prospects inthis world were now apparently shut upon him.After a while, came hope again, and kindlier symptoms:  but thedoctors intimated that there lay consumption in the question, and thatperfect recovery was not to be looked for.  For weeks he had beenconfined to bed; it was several months before he could leave hissick-room, where the visits of a few friends had much cheered him.And now when delivered, readmitted to the air of day again,--weak ashe was, and with such a liability still lurking in him,--what hisyoung partner and he were to do, or whitherward to turn for a goodcourse of life, was by no means too apparent.One of his Mother Mrs. Edward Sterling's Uncles, a Coningham fromDerry, had, in the course of his industrious and adventurous life,realized large property in the West Indies,--a valuable Sugar-estate,with its equipments, in the Island of St. Vincent;--from which Mrs.Sterling and her family were now, and had been for some years beforeher Uncle's decease, deriving important benefits.  I have heard, itwas then worth some ten thousand pounds a year to the partiesinterested.  Anthony Sterling, John, and another a cousin of theirswere ultimately to be heirs, in equal proportions.  The old gentleman,always kind to his kindred, and a brave and solid man though somewhatabrupt in his ways, had lately died; leaving a settlement to thiseffect, not without some intricacies, and almost caprices, in theconditions attached.This property, which is still a valuable one, was Sterling's chiefpecuniary outlook for the distant future.  Of course it well deservedtaking care of; and if the eye of the master were upon it, of coursetoo (according to the adage) the cattle would fatten better.  As thewarm climate was favorable to pulmonary complaints, and Sterling'soccupations were so shattered to pieces and his outlooks here so wasteand vague, why should not he undertake this duty for himself andothers?It was fixed upon as the eligiblest course.  A visit to St. Vincent,perhaps a permanent residence there:  he went into the project withhis customary impetuosity; his young Wife cheerfully consenting, andall manner of new hopes clustering round it.  There are the richtropical sceneries, the romance of the torrid zone with its new skiesand seas and lands; there are Blacks, and the Slavery question to beinvestigated:  there are the bronzed Whites and Yellows, and theirstrange new way of life:  by all means let us go andtry!--Arrangements being completed, so soon as his strength hadsufficiently recovered, and the harsh spring winds had sufficientlyabated, Sterling with his small household set sail for St. Vincent;and arrived without accident.  His first child, a son Edward, nowliving and grown to manhood, was born there, "at Brighton in theIsland of St. Vincent," in the fall of that year 1831.CHAPTER XII.ISLAND OF ST. VINCENT.Sterling found a pleasant residence, with all its adjuncts, ready forhim, at Colonarie, in this "volcanic Isle" under the hot sun.  Aninteresting Isle:  a place of rugged chasms, precipitous gnarledheights, and the most fruitful hollows; shaggy everywhere withluxuriant vegetation; set under magnificent skies, in the mirror ofthe summer seas; offering everywhere the grandest sudden outlooks andcontrasts.  His Letters represent a placidly cheerful riding life:  apensive humor, but the thunder-clouds all sleeping in the distance.Good relations with a few neighboring planters; indifference to thenoisy political and other agitations of the rest:  friendly, by nomeans romantic appreciation of the Blacks; quiet prosperity economicand domestic:  on the whole a healthy and recommendable way of life,with Literature very much in abeyance in it.He writes to Mr. Hare (date not given):  "The landscapes around mehere are noble and lovely as any that can be conceived on Earth.  Howindeed could it be otherwise, in a small Island of volcanic mountains,far within the Tropics, and perpetually covered with the richestvegetation?"  The moral aspect of things is by no means so good; butneither is that without its fair features.  "So far as I see, theSlaves here are cunning, deceitful and idle; without any greataptitude for ferocious crimes, and with very little scruple atcommitting others.  But I have seen them much only in very favorablecircumstances.  They are, as a body, decidedly unfit for freedom; andif left, as at present, completely in the hands of their masters, willnever become so, unless through the agency of the Methodists."[9]In the Autumn came an immense hurricane; with new and indeed quiteperilous experiences of West-Indian life.  This hasty Letter,addressed to his Mother, is not intrinsically his remarkablest fromSt. Vincent:  but the body of fact delineated in it being so much thegreatest, we will quote it in preference.  A West-Indian tornado, asJohn Sterling witnesses it, and with vivid authenticity describes it,may be considered worth looking at.       "_To Mrs. Sterling, South Place, Knightsbridge, London_.                            "BRIGHTON, ST. VINCENT, 28th August, 1831."MY DEAR MOTHER,--The packet came in yesterday; bringing me someNewspapers, a Letter from my Father, and one from Anthony, with a fewlines from you.  I wrote, some days ago, a hasty Note to my Father, onthe chance of its reaching you through Grenada sooner than anycommunication by the packet; and in it I spoke of the great misfortunewhich had befallen this Island and Barbadoes, but from which all thoseyou take an interest in have happily escaped unhurt."From the day of our arrival in the West Indies until Thursday the11th instant, which will long be a memorable day with us, I had beendoing my best to get ourselves established comfortably; and I had atlast bought the materials for making some additions to the house.  Buton the morning I have mentioned, all that I had exerted myself to do,nearly all the property both of Susan and myself, and the very housewe lived in, were suddenly destroyed by a visitation of Providence farmore terrible than any I have ever witnessed."When Susan came from her room, to breakfast, at eight o'clock, Ipointed out to her the extraordinary height and violence of the surf,and the singular appearance of the clouds of heavy rain sweeping downthe valleys before us.  At this time I had so little apprehension ofwhat was coming, that I talked of riding down to the shore when thestorm should abate, as I had never seen so fierce a sea.  In about aquarter of an hour the House-Negroes came in, to close the outsideshutters of the windows.  They knew that the plantain-trees about theNegro houses had been blown down in the night; and had told themaid-servant Tyrrell, but I had heard nothing of it.  A very fewminutes after the closing of the windows, I found that the shutters ofTyrrell's room, at the south and commonly the most sheltered end ofthe House, were giving way.  I tried to tie them; but the silkhandkerchief which I used soon gave way; and as I had neither hammer,boards nor nails in the house, I could do nothing more to keep out thetempest. I found, in pushing at the leaf of the shutter, that the windresisted, more as if it had been a stone wall or a mass of iron, thana mere current of air.  There were one or two people outside trying tofasten the windows, and I went out to help; but we had no tools athand:  one man was blown down the hill in front of the house, beforemy face; and the other and myself had great difficulty in getting backagain inside the door.  The rain on my face and hands felt like somuch small shot from a gun.  There was great exertion necessary toshut the door of the house."The windows at the end of the large room were now giving way; and Isuppose it was about nine o'clock, when the hurricane burst them in,as if it had been a discharge from a battery of heavy cannon.  Theshutters were first forced open, and the wind fastened them back tothe wall; and then the panes of glass were smashed by the mere forceof the gale, without anything having touched them.  Even now I was notat all sure the house would go.  My books, I saw, were lost; for therain poured past the bookcases, as if it had been the Colonarie River.But we carried a good deal of furniture into the passage at theentrance; we set Susan there on a sofa, and the Black Housekeeper waseven attempting to get her some breakfast. The house, however, beganto shake so violently, and the rain was so searching, that she couldnot stay there long.  She went into her own room and I stayed to seewhat could be done."Under the forepart of the house, there are cellars built of stone,but not arched.  To these, however, there was no access except on theoutside; and I knew from my own experience that Susan could not havegone a step beyond the door, without being carried away by the storm,and probably killed on the spot.  The only chance seemed to be that ofbreaking through the floor.  But when the old Cook and myself resolvedon this, we found that we had no instrument with which it would bepossible to do it.  It was now clear that we had only God to trust in.The front windows were giving way with successive crashes, and thefloor shook as you may have seen a carpet on a gusty day in London.  Iwent into our bedroom; where I found Susan, Tyrrell, and a littleColored girl of seven or eight years old; and told them that we shouldprobably not be alive in half an hour.  I could have escaped, if I hadchosen to go alone, by crawling on the ground either into the kitchen,a separate stone building at no great distance, or into the openfields away from trees or houses; but Susan could not have gone ayard.  She became quite calm when she knew the worst; and she sat onmy knee in what seemed the safest corner of the room, while everyblast was bringing nearer and nearer the moment of our seeminglycertain destruction.--"The house was under two parallel roofs; and the one next the sea,which sheltered the other, and us who were under the other, went off,I suppose about ten o'clock.  After my old plan, I will give you asketch, from which you may perceive how we were situated:--      [In print, a figure representing a floor-plan appears here]The _a_, _a_ are the windows that were first destroyed:  _b_ wentnext; my books were between the windows _b_, and on the wall oppositeto them.  The lines _c_ and _d_ mark the directions of the two roofs;_e_ is the room in which we were, and 2 is a plan of it on a largerscale.  Look now at 2:  _a_ is the bed; _c_, _c_ the two wardrobes;_b_ the corner in which we were.  I was sitting in an arm-chair,holding my Wife; and Tyrrell and the little Black child were close tous.  We had given up all notion of surviving; and only waited for thefall of the roof to perish together."Before long the roof went.  Most of the materials, however, werecarried clear away:  one of the large couples was caught on thebedpost marked _d_, and held fast by the iron spike; while the end ofit hung over our heads:  had the beam fallen an inch on either side ofthe bedpost, it must necessarily have crushed us.  The walls did notgo with the roof; and we remained for half an hour, alternatelypraying to God, and watching them as they bent, creaked, and shiveredbefore the storm."Tyrrell and the child, when the roof was off, made their way throughthe remains of the partition, to the outer door; and with the help ofthe people who were looking for us, got into the kitchen.  A goodwhile after they were gone, and before we knew anything of their fate,a Negro suddenly came upon us; and the sight of him gave us a hope ofsafety.  When the people learned that we were in danger, and whiletheir own huts were flying about their ears, they crowded to help us;and the old Cook urged them on to our rescue.  He made five attempts,after saving Tyrrell, to get to us; and four times he was blown down.The fifth time he, and the Negro we first saw, reached the house.  Thespace they had to traverse was not above twenty yards of level ground,if so much.  In another minute or two, the Overseers and a crowd ofNegroes, most of whom had come on their hands and knees, weresurrounding us; and with their help Susan was carried round to the endof the house; where they broke open the cellar window, and placed herin comparative safety.  The force of the hurricane was, by this time,a good deal diminished, or it would have been impossible to standbefore it."But the wind was still terrific; and the rain poured into the cellarsthrough the floor above.  Susan, Tyrrell, and a crowd of Negroesremained under it, for more than two hours:  and I was long afraidthat the wet and cold would kill her, if she did not perish moreviolently.  Happily we had wine and spirits at hand, and she was muchnerved by a tumbler of claret.  As soon as I saw her in comparativesecurity, I went off with one of the Overseers down to the Works,where the greater number of the Negroes were collected, that we mightsee what could be done for them.  They were wretched enough, but noone was hurt; and I ordered them a dram apiece, which seemed to givethem a good deal of consolation."Before I could make my way back, the hurricane became as bad as atfirst; and I was obliged to take shelter for half an hour in a ruinedNegro house.  This, however, was the last of its extreme violence.  Byone o'clock, even the rain had in a great degree ceased; and as onlyone room of the house, the one marked _f_; was standing, and thatrickety,--I had Susan carried in a chair down the hill, to theHospital; where, in a small paved unlighted room, she spent the nexttwenty-four hours.  She was far less injured than might have beenexpected from such a catastrophe."Next day, I had the passage at the entrance of the house repaired androofed; and we returned to the ruins of our habitation, stillencumbered as they were with the wreck of almost all we were possessedof.  The walls of the part of the house next the sea were carriedaway, in less I think than half an hour after we reached the cellar:when I had leisure to examine the remains of the house, I found thefloor strewn with fragments of the building, and with brokenfurniture; and our books all soaked as completely as if they had beenfor several hours in the sea."In the course of a few days I had the other room, _g_, which is underthe same roof as the one saved, rebuilt; and Susan stayed in thistemporary abode for a week,--when we left Colonarie, and came toBrighton.  Mr. Munro's kindness exceeds all precedent.  We shallcertainly remain here till my Wife is recovered from her confinement.In the mean while we shall have a new house built, in which we hope tobe well settled before Christmas."The roof was half blown off the kitchen, but I have had it mendedalready; the other offices were all swept away.  The gig is muchinjured; and my horse received a wound in the fall of the stable, fromwhich he will not be recovered for some weeks:  in the mean time Ihave no choice but to buy another, as I must go at least once or twicea week to Colonarie, besides business in Town.  As to our owncomforts, we can scarcely expect ever to recover from the blow thathas now stricken us.  No money would repay me for the loss of mybooks, of which a large proportion had been in my hands for so manyyears that they were like old and faithful friends, and of which manyhad been given me at different times by the persons in the world whomI most value."But against all this I have to set the preservation of our lives, ina way the most awfully providential; and the safety of every one onthe Estate.  And I have also the great satisfaction of reflecting thatall the Negroes from whom any assistance could reasonably be expected,behaved like so many Heroes of Antiquity; risking their lives andlimbs for us and our property, while their own poor houses were flyinglike chaff before the hurricane.  There are few White people here whocan say as much for their Black dependents; and the force and value ofthe relation between Master and Slave has been tried by the latecalamity on a large scale."Great part of both sides of this Island has been laid completelywaste.  The beautiful wide and fertile Plain called the CharibCountry, extending for many miles to the north of Colonarie, andformerly containing the finest sets of works and best dwelling-housesin the Island, is, I am told, completely desolate:  on several estatesnot a roof even of a Negro hut standing.  In the embarrassedcircumstances of many of the proprietors, the ruin is, I fear,irreparable.--At Colonarie the damage is serious, but by no meansdesperate.  The crop is perhaps injured ten or fifteen per cent.  Theroofs of several large buildings are destroyed, but these we arealready supplying; and the injuries done to the cottages of theNegroes are, by this time, nearly if not quite remedied."Indeed, all that has been suffered in St. Vincent appears nothingwhen compared with the appalling loss of property and of human livesat Barbadoes.  There the Town is little but a heap of ruins, and thecorpses are reckoned by thousands; while throughout the Island thereare not, I believe, ten estates on which the buildings are standing.The Elliotts, from whom we have heard, are living with all theirfamily in a tent; and may think themselves wonderfully saved, whenwhole families round them were crushed at once beneath their houses.Hugh Barton, the only officer of the Garrison hurt, has broken hisarm, and we know nothing of his prospects of recovery.  The morehorrible misfortune of Barbadoes is partly to be accounted for by thefact of the hurricane having begun there during the night.  Theflatness of the surface in that Island presented no obstacle to thewind, which must, however, I think have been in itself more furiousthan with us.  No other island has suffered considerably."I have told both my Uncle and Anthony that I have given you thedetails of our recent history;--which are not so pleasant that Ishould wish to write them again.  Perhaps you will be good enough tolet them see this, as soon as you and my Father can spare it....  I amever, dearest Mother,                    "Your grateful and affectionate                                                      "JOHN STERLING."This Letter, I observe, is dated 28th August, 1831; which is otherwisea day of mark to the world and me,--the Poet Goethe's last birthday.While Sterling sat in the Tropical solitudes, penning this history,little European Weimar had its carriages and state-carriages busy onthe streets, and was astir with compliments and visiting-cards, doingits best, as heretofore, on behalf of a remarkable day; and was not,for centuries or tens of centuries, to see the like of it again!--At Brighton, the hospitable home of those Munros, our friendscontinued for above two months.  Their first child, Edward, as abovenoticed, was born here, "14th October, 1831;"--and now the poor lady,safe from all her various perils, could return to Colonarie under goodauspices.It was in this year that I first heard definitely of Sterling as acontemporary existence; and laid up some note and outline of him in mymemory, as of one whom I might yet hope to know.  John Mill, Mrs.Austin and perhaps other friends, spoke of him with great affectionand much pitying admiration; and hoped to see him home again, underbetter omens, from over the seas.  As a gifted amiable being, of acertain radiant tenuity and velocity, too thin and rapid anddiffusive, in danger of dissipating himself into the vague, or alasinto death itself:  it was so that, like a spot of bright colors,rather than a portrait with features, he hung occasionally visible inmy imagination.CHAPTER XIII.A CATASTROPHE.The ruin of his house had hardly been repaired, when there arrived outof Europe tidings which smote as with a still more fatal hurricane onthe four corners of his inner world, and awoke all the old thundersthat lay asleep on his horizon there.  Tidings, at last of a decisivenature, from Gibraltar and the Spanish democrat adventure.  This iswhat the Newspapers had to report--the catastrophe at once, thedetails by degrees--from Spain concerning that affair, in thebeginning of the new year 1832.Torrijos, as we have seen, had hitherto accomplished as good asnothing, except disappointment to his impatient followers, and sorrowand regret to himself.  Poor Torrijos, on arriving at Gibraltar withhis wild band, and coming into contact with the rough fact, had foundpainfully how much his imagination had deceived him.  The fact layround him haggard and iron-bound; flatly refusing to be handledaccording to his scheme of it.  No Spanish soldiery nor citizenryshowed the least disposition to join him; on the contrary the officialSpaniards of that coast seemed to have the watchfulest eye on all hismovements, nay it was conjectured they had spies in Gibraltar whogathered his very intentions and betrayed them.  This small project ofattack, and then that other, proved futile, or was abandoned beforethe attempt.  Torrijos had to lie painfully within the lines ofGibraltar,--his poor followers reduced to extremity of impatience anddistress; the British Governor too, though not unfriendly to him,obliged to frown.  As for the young Cantabs, they, as was said, hadwandered a little over the South border of romantic Spain; had perhapsseen Seville, Cadiz, with picturesque views, since not withbelligerent ones; and their money being done, had now returned home.So had it lasted for eighteen months.The French Three Days breaking out had armed the Guerrillero Mina,armed all manner of democratic guerrieros and guerrilleros; andconsiderable clouds of Invasion, from Spanish exiles, hung minatoryover the North and North-East of Spain, supported by the new-bornFrench Democracy, so far as privately possible.  These Torrijos had tolook upon with inexpressible feelings, and take no hand in supportingfrom the South; these also he had to see brushed away, successivelyabolished by official generalship; and to sit within his lines, in thepainfulest manner, unable to do anything.  The fated, gallant-minded,but too headlong man.  At length the British Governor himself wasobliged, in official decency and as is thought on repeatedremonstrance from his Spanish official neighbors, to signify howindecorous, improper and impossible it was to harbor within one'slines such explosive preparations, once they were discovered, againstallies in full peace with us,--the necessity, in fact, there was forthe matter ending.  It is said, he offered Torrijos and his peoplepassports, and British protection, to any country of the world exceptSpain:  Torrijos did not accept the passports; spoke of goingpeaceably to this place or to that; promised at least, what he saw andfelt to be clearly necessary, that he would soon leave Gibraltar.  Andhe did soon leave it; he and his, Boyd alone of the Englishmen beingnow with him.It was on the last night of November, 1831, that they all set forth;Torrijos with Fifty-five companions; and in two small vesselscommitted themselves to their nigh-desperate fortune.  No sentry orofficial person had noticed them; it was from the Spanish Consul, nextmorning, that the British Governor first heard they were gone.  TheBritish Governor knew nothing of them; but apparently the Spanishofficials were much better informed.  Spanish guardships, instantlyawake, gave chase to the two small vessels, which were making all sailtowards Malaga; and, on shore, all manner of troops and detachedparties were in motion, to render a retreat to Gibraltar by landimpossible.Crowd all sail for Malaga, then; there perhaps a regiment will joinus; there,--or if not, we are but lost!  Fancy need not paint a moretragic situation than that of Torrijos, the unfortunate gallant man,in the gray of this morning, first of December, 1831,--his last freemorning.  Noble game is afoot, afoot at last; and all the hunters havehim in their toils.--The guardships gain upon Torrijos; he cannot evenreach Malaga; has to run ashore at a place called Fuengirola, not farfrom that city;--the guardships seizing his vessels, so soon as he isdisembarked.  The country is all up; troops scouring the coasteverywhere:  no possibility of getting into Malaga with a party ofFifty-five.  He takes possession of a farmstead (Ingles, the place iscalled); barricades himself there, but is speedily beleaguered withforces hopelessly superior.  He demands to treat; is refused alltreaty; is granted six hours to consider, shall then either surrenderat discretion, or be forced to do it.  Of course he _does_ it, havingno alternative; and enters Malaga a prisoner, all his followersprisoners.  Here had the Torrijos Enterprise, and all that wasembarked upon it, finally arrived.Express is sent to Madrid; express instantly returns; "Militaryexecution on the instant; give them shriving if they want it; thatdone, fusillade them all."  So poor Torrijos and his followers, thewhole Fifty-six of them, Robert Boyd included, meet swift death inMalaga.  In such manner rushes down the curtain on them and theiraffair; they vanish thus on a sudden; rapt away as in black clouds offate.  Poor Boyd, Sterling's cousin, pleaded his British citizenship;to no purpose:  it availed only to his dead body, this was deliveredto the British Consul for interment, and only this.  Poor MadamTorrijos, hearing, at Paris where she now was, of her husband'scapture, hurries towards Madrid to solicit mercy; whither alsomessengers from Lafayette and the French Government were hurrying, onthe like errand:  at Bayonne, news met the poor lady that it wasalready all over, that she was now a widow, and her husband hiddenfrom her forever.--Such was the handsel of the new year 1832 forSterling in his West-Indian solitudes.Sterling's friends never heard of these affairs; indeed we were allsecretly warned not to mention the name of Torrijos in his hearing,which accordingly remained strictly a forbidden subject.  His miseryover this catastrophe was known, in his own family, to have beenimmense.  He wrote to his Brother Anthony:  "I hear the sound of thatmusketry; it is as if the bullets were tearing my own brain."  Tofigure in one's sick and excited imagination such a scene of fatalman-hunting, lost valor hopelessly captured and massacred; and to addto it, that the victims are not men merely, that they are noble anddear forms known lately as individual friends:  what a Dance of theFuries and wild-pealing Dead-march is this, for the mind of a loving,generous and vivid man!  Torrijos getting ashore at Fuengirola; RobertBoyd and others ranked to die on the esplanade at Malaga--Nay had notSterling, too, been the innocent yet heedless means of Boyd'sembarking in this enterprise?  By his own kinsman poor Boyd had beenwitlessly guided into the pitfalls.  "I hear the sound of thatmusketry; it is as if the bullets were tearing my own brain!"CHAPTER XIV.PAUSE.These thoughts dwelt long with Sterling; and for a good while, Ifancy, kept possession of the proscenium of his mind; madly paradingthere, to the exclusion of all else,--coloring all else with their ownblack hues.  He was young, rich in the power to be miserable orotherwise; and this was his first grand sorrow which had now fallenupon him.An important spiritual crisis, coming at any rate in some form, hadhereby suddenly in a very sad form come.  No doubt, as youth waspassing into manhood in these Tropical seclusions, and higher wantswere awakening in his mind, and years and reflection were adding newinsight and admonition, much in his young way of thought and actionlay already under ban with him, and repentances enough over manythings were not wanting.  But here on a sudden had all repentances, asit were, dashed themselves together into one grand whirlwind ofrepentance; and his past life was fallen wholly as into a state ofreprobation.  A great remorseful misery had come upon him.  Suddenly,as with a sudden lightning-stroke, it had kindled into conflagrationall the ruined structure of his past life; such ruin had to blaze andflame round him, in the painfulest manner, till it went out in blackashes.  His democratic philosophies, and mutinous radicalisms, alreadyfalling doomed in his thoughts, had reached their consummation andfinal condemnation here.  It was all so rash, imprudent, arrogant, allthat; false, or but half true; inapplicable wholly as a rule of nobleconduct;--and it has ended _thus_.  Woe on it!  Another guidance mustbe found in life, or life is impossible!--It is evident, Sterling's thoughts had already, since the old days ofthe "black dragoon," much modified themselves.  We perceive that, bymere increase of experience and length of time, the opposite and muchdeeper side of the question, which also has its adamantine basis oftruth, was in turn coming into play; and in fine that a Philosophy ofDenial, and world illuminated merely by the flames of Destruction,could never have permanently been the resting-place of such a man.Those pilgrimings to Coleridge, years ago, indicate deeper wantsbeginning to be felt, and important ulterior resolutions becominginevitable for him.  If in your own soul there is any tone of the"Eternal Melodies," you cannot live forever in those poor outer,transitory grindings and discords; you will have to struggle inwardsand upwards, in search of some diviner home for yourself!--Coleridge'sprophetic moonshine, Torrijos's sad tragedy:  those were importantoccurrences in Sterling's life.  But, on the whole, there was a bigOcean for him, with impetuous Gulf-streams, and a doomed voyage inquest of the Atlantis, _before_ either of those arose as lights on thehorizon.  As important beacon-lights let us count themnevertheless;--signal-dates they form to us, at lowest. We may reckonthis Torrijos tragedy the crisis of Sterling's history; theturning-point, which modified, in the most important and by no meanswholly in the most favorable manner, all the subsequent stages of it.Old Radicalism and mutinous audacious Ethnicism having thus fallen towreck, and a mere black world of misery and remorse now disclosingitself, whatsoever of natural piety to God and man, whatsoever of pityand reverence, of awe and devout hope was in Sterling's heart nowawoke into new activity; and strove for some due utterance andpredominance. His Letters, in these months, speak of earnest religiousstudies and efforts;--of attempts by prayer and longing endeavor ofall kinds, to struggle his way into the temple, if temple there were,and there find sanctuary.[10]  The realities were grown so haggard;life a field of black ashes, if there rose no temple anywhere on it!Why, like a fated Orestes, is man so whipt by the Furies, and drivenmadly hither and thither, if it is not even that he may seek someshrine, and there make expiation and find deliverance?In these circumstances, what a scope for Coleridge's philosophy, aboveall!  "If the bottled moonshine _be_ actually substance?  Ah, couldone but believe in a Church while finding it incredible!  What isfaith; what is conviction, credibility, insight?  Can a thing be atonce known for true, and known for false?  'Reason,' 'Understanding:'is there, then, such an internecine war between these two?  It was soColeridge imagined it, the wisest of existing men!"--No, it is not aneasy matter (according to Sir Kenelm Digby), this of getting up your"astral spirit" of a thing, and setting it in action, when the thingitself is well burnt to ashes.  Poor Sterling; poor sons of Adam ingeneral, in this sad age of cobwebs, worn-out symbolisms,reminiscences and simulacra!  Who can tell the struggles of poorSterling, and his pathless wanderings through these things!  Longafterwards, in speech with his Brother, he compared his case in thistime to that of "a young lady who has tragically lost her lover, andis willing to be half-hoodwinked into a convent, or in any noble orquasi-noble way to escape from a world which has become intolerable."During the summer of 1832, I find traces of attempts towardsAnti-Slavery Philanthropy; shadows of extensive schemes in thatdirection.  Half-desperate outlooks, it is likely, towards the refugeof Philanthropism, as a new chivalry of life.  These took no serioushold of so clear an intellect; but they hovered now and afterwards asday-dreams, when life otherwise was shorn of aim;--mirages in thedesert, which are found not to be lakes when you put your bucket intothem.  One thing was clear, the sojourn in St. Vincent was not to lastmuch longer.Perhaps one might get some scheme raised into life, in Downing Street,for universal Education to the Blacks, preparatory to emancipatingthem?  There were a noble work for a man!  Then again poor Mrs.Sterling's health, contrary to his own, did not agree with warm moistclimates.  And again, &c. &c.  These were the outer surfaces of themeasure; the unconscious pretexts under which it showed itself toSterling and was shown by him:  but the inner heart and determiningcause of it (as frequently in Sterling's life, and in all our lives)was not these.  In brief, he had had enough of St. Vincent.  Thestrangling oppressions of his soul were too heavy for him there.Solution lay in Europe, or might lie; not in these remote solitudes ofthe sea,--where no shrine or saint's well is to be looked for, nocommuning of pious pilgrims journeying together towards a shrine.CHAPTER XV.BONN; HERSTMONCEUX.After a residence of perhaps fifteen months Sterling quitted St.Vincent, and never returned.  He reappeared at his Father's house, tothe joy of English friends, in August, 1832; well improved in health,and eager for English news; but, beyond vague schemes andpossibilities, considerably uncertain what was next to be done.After no long stay in this scene,--finding Downing Street dead asstone to the Slave-Education and to all other schemes,--he wentacross, with his wife and child, to Germany; purposing to make not somuch a tour as some loose ramble, or desultory residence in thatcountry, in the Rhineland first of all.  Here was to be hoped thepicturesque in scenery, which he much affected; here the new and truein speculation, which he inwardly longed for and wanted greatly more;at all events, here as readily as elsewhere might a temporaryhousehold be struck up, under interesting circumstances.--I concludehe went across in the Spring of 1833; perhaps directly after _ArthurConingsby_ had got through the press.  This Novel, which, as we havesaid, was begun two or three years ago, probably on his cessation fromthe _Athenaeum_, and was mainly finished, I think, before the removalto St. Vincent, had by this time fallen as good as obsolete to his ownmind; and its destination now, whether to the press or to the fire,was in some sort a matter at once of difficulty and of insignificanceto him.  At length deciding for the milder alternative, he had thrownin some completing touches here and there,--especially, as Iconjecture, a proportion of Coleridgean moonshine at the end; and sosent it forth.It was in the sunny days, perhaps in May or June of this year, that_Arthur Coningsby_ reached my own hand, far off amid the heathywildernesses; sent by John Mill:  and I can still recollect thepleasant little episode it made in my solitude there.  The generalimpression it left on me, which has never since been renewed by asecond reading in whole or in part, was the certain prefigurement tomyself, more or less distinct, of an opulent, genial and sunny mind,but misdirected, disappointed, experienced in misery;--nay crude andhasty; mistaking for a solid outcome from its woes what was only to mea gilded vacuity.  The hero an ardent youth, representing Sterlinghimself, plunges into life such as we now have it in these anarchictimes, with the radical, utilitarian, or mutinous heathen theory,which is the readiest for inquiring souls; finds, by various coursesof adventure, utter shipwreck in this; lies broken, very wretched:that is the tragic nodus, or apogee of his life-course.  In this moodof mind, he clutches desperately towards some new method (recognizableas Coleridge's) of laying hand again on the old Church, which hashitherto been extraneous and as if non-extant to his way of thought;makes out, by some Coleridgean legedermain, that there actually isstill a Church for him; that this extant Church, which he long tookfor an extinct shadow, is not such, but a substance; upon which he cananchor himself amid the storms of fate;--and he does so, even takingorders in it, I think.  Such could by no means seem to me the true ortenable solution.  Here clearly, struggling amid the tumults, was alovable young fellow-soul; who had by no means yet got to land; but ofwhom much might be hoped, if he ever did.  Some of the delineationsare highly pictorial, flooded with a deep ruddy effulgence; betokeningmuch wealth, in the crude or the ripe state.  The hope of perhaps, oneday, knowing Sterling, was welcome and interesting to me.  _ArthurConingsby_, struggling imperfectly in a sphere high abovecirculating-library novels, gained no notice whatever in that quarter;gained, I suppose in a few scattered heads, some such recognition asthe above; and there rested.  Sterling never mentioned the name of itin my hearing, or would hear it mentioned.In those very days while _Arthur Coningsby_ was getting read amid theScottish moors, "in June, 1833," Sterling, at Bonn in theRhine-country, fell in with his old tutor and friend, the ReverendJulius Hare; one with whom he always delighted to communicate,especially on such topics as then altogether occupied him.  A man ofcheerful serious character, of much approved accomplishment, ofperfect courtesy; surely of much piety, in all senses of that word.Mr. Hare had quitted his scholastic labors and distinctions, some timeago; the call or opportunity for taking orders having come; and asRector of Herstmonceux in Sussex, a place patrimonially and otherwiseendeared to him, was about entering, under the best omens, on a newcourse of life.  He was now on his return from Rome, and a visit ofsome length to Italy.  Such a meeting could not but be welcome andimportant to Sterling in such a mood.  They had much earnestconversation, freely communing on the highest matters; especially ofSterling's purpose to undertake the clerical profession, in whichcourse his reverend friend could not but bid him good speed.It appears, Sterling already intimated his intention to become aclergyman:  He would study theology, biblicalities, perfect himself inthe knowledge seemly or essential for his new course;--read diligently"for a year or two in some good German University," then seek toobtain orders:  that was his plan.  To which Mr. Hare gave his hearty_Euge_; adding that if his own curacy happened then to be vacant, heshould be well pleased to have Sterling in that office.  So theyparted."A year or two" of serious reflection "in some good GermanUniversity," or anywhere in the world, might have thrown muchelucidation upon these confused strugglings and purposings ofSterling's, and probably have spared him some confusion in hissubsequent life.  But the talent of waiting was, of all others, theone he wanted most. Impetuous velocity, all-hoping headlong alacrity,what we must call rashness and impatience, characterized him in mostof his important and unimportant procedures; from the purpose to theexecution there was usually but one big leap with him.  A few monthsafter Mr. Hare was gone, Sterling wrote that his purposes were alittle changed by the late meeting at Bonn; that he now longed toenter the Church straightway:  that if the Herstmonceux Curacy wasstill vacant, and the Rector's kind thought towards him still held, hewould instantly endeavor to qualify himself for that office.Answer being in the affirmative on both heads, Sterling returned toEngland; took orders,--"ordained deacon at Chichester on TrinitySunday in 1834" (he never became technically priest):--and so, havingfitted himself and family with a reasonable house, in one of thoseleafy lanes in quiet Herstmonceux, on the edge of Pevensey Level, hecommenced the duties of his Curacy.The bereaved young lady has _taken_ the veil, then!  Even so.  "Lifeis growing all so dark and brutal; must be redeemed into human, if itwill continue life.  Some pious heroism, to give a human color to lifeagain, on any terms,"--even on impossible ones!To such length can transcendental moonshine, cast by some morbidlyradiating Coleridge into the chaos of a fermenting life, act magicallythere, and produce divulsions and convulsions and diseaseddevelopments.  So dark and abstruse, without lamp or authenticfinger-post, is the course of pious genius towards the EternalKingdoms grown.  No fixed highway more; the old spiritual highways andrecognized paths to the Eternal, now all torn up and flung in heaps,submerged in unutterable boiling mud-oceans of Hypocrisy andUnbelievability, of brutal living Atheism and damnable dead putrescentCant:  surely a tragic pilgrimage for all mortals; Darkness, and themere shadow of Death, enveloping all things from pole to pole; and inthe raging gulf-currents, offering us will-o'-wisps forloadstars,--intimating that there are no stars, nor ever were, exceptcertain Old-Jew ones which have now gone out.  Once more, a tragicpilgrimage for all mortals; and for the young pious soul, winged withgenius, and passionately seeking land, and passionately abhorrent offloating carrion withal, more tragical than for any!--A pilgrimage wemust all undertake nevertheless, and make the best of with ourrespective means.  Some arrive; a glorious few:  many must belost,--go down upon the floating wreck which they took for land.  Nay,courage!  These also, so far as there was any heroism in them, havebequeathed their life as a contribution to us, have valiantly laidtheir bodies in the chasm for us:  of these also there is no ray ofheroism _lost_,--and, on the whole, what else of them could or shouldbe "saved" at any time?  Courage, and ever Forward!Concerning this attempt of Sterling's to find sanctuary in the oldChurch, and desperately grasp the hem of her garment in such manner,there will at present be many opinions:  and mine must be recordedhere in flat reproval of it, in mere pitying condemnation of it, as arash, false, unwise and unpermitted step.  Nay, among the evil lessonsof his Time to poor Sterling, I cannot but account this the worst;properly indeed, as we may say, the apotheosis, the solemn apology andconsecration, of all the evil lessons that were in it to him.  Alas,if we did remember the divine and awful nature of God's Truth, and hadnot so forgotten it as poor doomed creatures never did before,--shouldwe, durst we in our most audacious moments, think of wedding _it_ tothe World's Untruth, which is also, like all untruths, the Devil's?Only in the world's last lethargy can such things be done, andaccounted safe and pious!  Fools!  "Do you think the Living God is abuzzard idol," sternly asks Milton, that you dare address Him in thismanner?--Such darkness, thick sluggish clouds of cowardice andoblivious baseness, have accumulated on us:  thickening as if towardsthe eternal sleep!  It is not now known, what never needed proof orstatement before, that Religion is not a doubt; that it is acertainty,--or else a mockery and horror.  That none or all of themany things we are in doubt about, and need to have demonstrated andrendered probable, can by any alchemy be made a "Religion" for us; butare and must continue a baleful, quiet or unquiet, Hypocrisy for us;and bring--_salvation_, do we fancy?  I think, it is another thingthey will bring, and are, on all hands, visibly bringing this goodwhile!--The time, then, with its deliriums, has done its worst for poorSterling.  Into deeper aberration it cannot lead him; this is thecrowning error.  Happily, as beseems the superlative of errors, it wasa very brief, almost a momentary one.  In June, 1834, Sterling datesas installed at Herstmonceux; and is flinging, as usual, his wholesoul into the business; successfully so far as outward results couldshow:  but already in September, he begins to have misgivings; and inFebruary following, quits it altogether,--the rest of his life being,in great part, a laborious effort of detail to pick the fragments ofit off him, and be free of it in soul as well as in title.At this the extreme point of spiritual deflexion and depression, whenthe world's madness, unusually impressive on such a man, has done itsvery worst with him, and in all future errors whatsoever he will be alittle less mistaken, we may close the First Part of Sterling's Life.PART II.CHAPTER I.CURATE.By Mr. Hare's account, no priest of any Church could more ferventlyaddress himself to his functions than Sterling now did.  He went aboutamong the poor, the ignorant, and those that had need of help;zealously forwarded schools and beneficences; strove, with his wholemight, to instruct and aid whosoever suffered consciously in body, orstill worse unconsciously in mind.  He had charged himself to make theApostle Paul his model; the perils and voyagings and ultimatemartyrdom of Christian Paul, in those old ages, on the great scale,were to be translated into detail, and become the practical emblem ofChristian Sterling on the coast of Sussex in this new age.  "It wouldbe no longer from Jerusalem to Damascus," writes Sterling, "to Arabia,to Derbe, Lystra, Ephesus, that he would travel:  but each house ofhis appointed Parish would be to him what each of those great citieswas,--a place where he would bend his whole being, and spend his heartfor the conversion, purification, elevation of those under hisinfluence.  The whole man would be forever at work for this purpose;head, heart, knowledge, time, body, possessions, all would be directedto this end."  A high enough model set before one:--how to berealized!--Sterling hoped to realize it, to struggle towards realizingit, in some small degree.  This is Mr. Hare's report of him:--"He was continually devising some fresh scheme for improving thecondition of the Parish.  His aim was to awaken the minds of thepeople, to arouse their conscience, to call forth their sense of moralresponsibility, to make them feel their own sinfulness, their need ofredemption, and thus lead them to a recognition of the Divine Love bywhich that redemption is offered to us.  In visiting them he wasdiligent in all weathers, to the risk of his own health, which wasgreatly impaired thereby; and his gentleness and considerate care forthe sick won their affection; so that, though his stay was very short,his name is still, after a dozen years, cherished by many."How beautiful would Sterling be in all this; rushing forward like ahost towards victory; playing and pulsing like sunshine or softlightning; busy at all hours to perform his part in abundant andsuperabundant measure!  "Of that which it was to me personally,"continues Mr. Hare, "to have such a fellow-laborer, to live constantlyin the freest communion with such a friend, I cannot speak.  He cameto me at a time of heavy affliction, just after I had heard that theBrother, who had been the sharer of all my thoughts and feelings fromchildhood, had bid farewell to his earthly life at Rome; and thus heseemed given to me to make up in some sort for him whom I had lost.Almost daily did I look out for his usual hour of coming to me, andwatch his tall slender form walking rapidly across the hill in frontof my window; with the assurance that he was coming to cheer andbrighten, to rouse and stir me, to call me up to some height offeeling, or down to some depth of thought.  His lively spirit,responding instantaneously to every impulse of Nature and Art; hisgenerous ardor in behalf of whatever is noble and true; his scorn ofall meanness, of all false pretences and conventional beliefs,softened as it was by compassion for the victims of those besettingsins of a cultivated age; his never-flagging impetuosity in pushingonward to some unattained point of duty or of knowledge:  all this,along with his gentle, almost reverential affectionateness towards hisformer tutor, rendered my intercourse with him an unspeakableblessing; and time after time has it seemed to me that his visit hadbeen like a shower of rain, bringing down freshness and brightness ona dusty roadside hedge.  By him too the recollection of these ourdaily meetings was cherished till the last."[11]There are many poor people still at Herstmonceux who affectionatelyremember him:  Mr. Hare especially makes mention of one good manthere, in his young days "a poor cobbler," and now advanced to a muchbetter position, who gratefully ascribes this outward and the otherimprovements in his life to Sterling's generous encouragement andcharitable care for him.  Such was the curate life at Herstmonceux.So, in those actual leafy lanes, on the edge of Pevensey Level, inthis new age, did our poor New Paul (on hest of certain oracles)diligently study to comport himself,--and struggle with all his might_not_ to be a moonshine shadow of the First Paul.It was in this summer of 1834,--month of May, shortly after arrivingin London,--that I first saw Sterling's Father.  A stout broadgentleman of sixty, perpendicular in attitude, rather showily dressed,and of gracious, ingenious and slightly elaborate manners.  It was atMrs. Austin's in Bayswater; he was just taking leave as I entered, soour interview lasted only a moment:  but the figure of the man, asSterling's father, had already an interest for me, and I remember thetime well.  Captain Edward Sterling, as we formerly called him, hadnow quite dropt the military title, nobody even of his friends nowremembering it; and was known, according to his wish, in political andother circles, as Mr. Sterling, a private gentleman of some figure.Over whom hung, moreover, a kind of mysterious nimbus as the principalor one of the principal writers in the _Times_, which gave aninteresting chiaroscuro to his character in society.  A potent,profitable, but somewhat questionable position; of which, though heaffected, and sometimes with anger, altogether to disown it, andrigorously insisted on the rights of anonymity, he was not unwillingto take the honors too:  the private pecuniary advantages were veryundeniable; and his reception in the Clubs, and occasionally in higherquarters, was a good deal modelled on the universal belief in it.John Sterling at Herstmonceux that afternoon, and his Father here inLondon, would have offered strange contrasts to an eye that had seenthem both.  Contrasts, and yet concordances.  They were two verydifferent-looking men, and were following two very different modes ofactivity that afternoon.  And yet with a strange family likeness, too,both in the men and their activities; the central impulse in each, thefaculties applied to fulfil said impulse, not at all dissimilar,--asgrew visible to me on farther knowledge.CHAPTER II.NOT CURATE.Thus it went on for some months at Herstmonceux; but thus it could notlast. We said there were already misgivings as to health, &c. inSeptember:[12] that was but the fourth month, for it had begun only inJune.  The like clouds of misgiving, flights of dark vapor, chequeringmore and more the bright sky of this promised land, rose heavier andrifer month after month; till in February following, that is in theeighth month from starting, the sky had grown quite overshaded; andpoor Sterling had to think practically of departure from his promisedland again, finding that the goal of his pilgrimage was _not_ there.Not there, wherever it may be!  March again, therefore; the abidingcity, and post at which we can live and die, is still ahead of us, itwould appear!"Ill-health" was the external cause; and, to all parties concerned, toSterling himself I have no doubt as completely as to any, the onedetermining cause.  Nor was the ill-health wanting; it was there intoo sad reality.  And yet properly it was not there as the burden; itwas there as the last ounce which broke the camel's back.  I take it,in this as in other cases known to me, ill-health was not the primarycause but rather the ultimate one, the summing-up of innumerable fardeeper conscious and unconscious causes,--the cause which could boldlyshow itself on the surface, and give the casting vote.  Such was oftenSterling's way, as one could observe in such cases:  though the mostguileless, undeceptive and transparent of men, he had a noticeable,almost childlike faculty of self-deception, and usually substitutedfor the primary determining motive and set of motives, some ultimateostensible one, and gave that out to himself and others as the rulingimpulse for important changes in life.  As is the way with much moreponderous and deliberate men;--as is the way, in a degree, with allmen!Enough, in February, 1835, Sterling came up to London, to consult withhis physicians,--and in fact in all ways to consider with himself andfriends,--what was to be done in regard to this Herstmonceux business.The oracle of the physicians, like that of Delphi, was not exceedinglydeterminate:  but it did bear, what was a sufficiently undeniablefact, that Sterling's constitution, with a tendency to pulmonaryailments, was ill-suited for the office of a preacher; that totalabstinence from preaching for a year or two would clearly be the safercourse.  To which effect he writes to Mr. Hare with a tone ofsorrowful agitation; gives up his clerical duties atHerstmonceux;--and never resumed them there or elsewhere.  He had beenin the Church eight months in all:  a brief section of his life, butan important one, which colored several of his subsequent years, andnow strangely colors all his years in the memory of some.This we may account the second grand crisis of his History.Radicalism, not long since, had come to its consummation, and vanishedfrom him in a tragic manner.  "Not by Radicalism is the path to HumanNobleness for me!"  And here now had English Priesthood risen like asun, over the waste ruins and extinct volcanoes of his dead Radicalworld, with promise of new blessedness and healing under its Wings;and this too has soon found itself an illusion:  "Not by Priesthoodeither lies the way, then.  Once more, where does the way lie!"--Tofollow illusions till they burst and vanish is the lot of all newsouls who, luckily or lucklessly, are left to their own choice instarting on this Earth.  The roads are many; the authenticfinger-posts are few,--never fewer than in this era, when in so manysenses the waters are out.  Sterling of all men had the quickest sensefor nobleness, heroism and the human _summum bonum_; the liveliestheadlong spirit of adventure and audacity; few gifted living men lessstubbornness of perseverance.  Illusions, in his chase of the _summumbonum_, were not likely to be wanting; aberrations, and wastefulchanges of course, were likely to be many!  It is in the history ofsuch vehement, trenchant, far-shining and yet intrinsically light andvolatile souls, missioned into this epoch to seek their way there,that we best see what a confused epoch it is.This clerical aberration,--for such it undoubtedly was inSterling,--we have ascribed to Coleridge; and do clearly think thathad there been no Coleridge, neither had this been,--nor had EnglishPuseyism or some other strange enough universal portents been.Nevertheless, let us say farther that it lay partly in the generalbearing of the world for such a man.  This battle, universal in oursad epoch of "all old things passing away" against "all thingsbecoming new," has its summary and animating heart in that ofRadicalism against Church; there, as in its flaming core, and point offocal splendor, does the heroic worth that lies in each side of thequarrel most clearly disclose itself; and Sterling was the man, abovemany, to recognize such worth on both sides.  Natural enough, in sucha one, that the light of Radicalism having gone out in darkness forhim, the opposite splendor should next rise as the chief, and invitehis loyalty till it also failed.  In one form or the other, such anaberration was not unlikely for him.  But an aberration, especially inthis form, we may certainly call it.  No man of Sterling's veracity,had he clearly consulted his own heart, or had his own heart beencapable of clearly responding, and not been dazzled and bewildered bytransient fantasies and theosophic moonshine, could have undertakenthis function.  His heart would have answered:  "No, thou canst not.What is incredible to thee, thou shalt not, at thy soul's peril,attempt to believe!--Elsewhither for a refuge, or die here.  Go toPerdition if thou must,--but not with a lie in thy mouth; by theEternal Maker, no!"Alas, once more!  How are poor mortals whirled hither and thither inthe tumultuous chaos of our era; and, under the thick smoke-canopywhich has eclipsed all stars, how do they fly now after this poormeteor, now after that!--Sterling abandoned his clerical office inFebruary, 1835; having held it, and ardently followed it, so long aswe say,--eight calendar months in all.It was on this his February expedition to London that I first sawSterling,--at the India House incidentally, one afternoon, where Ifound him in company with John Mill, whom I happened like himself tobe visiting for a few minutes.  The sight of one whose fine qualitiesI had often heard of lately, was interesting enough; and, on thewhole, proved not disappointing, though it was the translation ofdream into fact, that is of poetry into prose, and showed its unrhymedside withal.  A loose, careless-looking, thin figure, in careless dimcostume, sat, in a lounging posture, carelessly and copiously talking.I was struck with the kindly but restless swift-glancing eyes, whichlooked as if the spirits were all out coursing like a pack of merryeager beagles, beating every bush.  The brow, rather sloping in form,was not of imposing character, though again the head was longish,which is always the best sign of intellect; the physiognomy in generalindicated animation rather than strength.We talked rapidly of various unmemorable things:  I remember coming onthe Negroes, and noticing that Sterling's notion on the SlaveryQuestion had not advanced into the stage of mine.  In reference to thequestion whether an "engagement for life," on just terms, betweenparties who are fixed in the character of master and servant, as theWhites and the Negroes are, is not really better than one from day today,--he said with a kindly jeer, "I would have the Negroes themselvesconsulted as to that!"--and would not in the least believe that theNegroes were by no means final or perfect judges of it.--His address,I perceived, was abrupt, unceremonious; probably not at alldisinclined to logic, and capable of dashing in upon you like a chargeof Cossacks, on occasion:  but it was also eminently ingenious,social, guileless.  We did all very well together:  and Sterling and Iwalked westward in company, choosing whatever lanes or quieteststreets there were, as far as Knightsbridge where our roads parted;talking on moralities, theological philosophies; arguing copiously,but _except_ in opinion not disagreeingIn his notions on such subjects, the expected Coleridge cast ofthought was very visible; and he seemed to express it even withexaggeration, and in a fearless dogmatic manner.  Identity ofsentiment, difference of opinion:  these are the known elements of apleasant dialogue.  We parted with the mutual wish to meetagain;--which accordingly, at his Father's house and at mine, we soonrepeatedly did; and already, in the few days before his return toHerstmonceux, had laid the foundations of a frank intercourse,pointing towards pleasant intimacies both with himself and with hiscircle, which in the future were abundantly fulfilled.  His Mother,essentially and even professedly "Scotch," took to my Wife graduallywith a most kind maternal relation; his Father, a gallant showystirring gentleman, the Magus of the _Times_, had talk and argumentever ready, was an interesting figure, and more and more took interestin us.  We had unconsciously made an acquisition, which grew richerand wholesomer with every new year; and ranks now, seen in the palemoonlight of memory, and must ever rank, among the preciouspossessions of life.Sterling's bright ingenuity, and also his audacity, velocity andalacrity, struck me more and more.  It was, I think, on the occasionof a party given one of these evenings at his Father's, where Iremember John Mill, John Crawford, Mrs. Crawford, and a number ofyoung and elderly figures of distinction,--that a group having formedon the younger side of the room, and transcendentalisms and theologiesforming the topic, a number of deep things were said in abruptconversational style, Sterling in the thick of it.  For example, onesceptical figure praised the Church of England, in Hume's phrase, "asa Church tending to keep down fanaticism," and recommendable for itsvery indifferency; whereupon a transcendental figure urges him:  "Youare afraid of the horse's kicking:  but will you sacrifice allqualities to being safe from that?  Then get a dead horse.  Nonecomparable to that for not kicking in your stable!"  Upon which, alaugh; with new laughs on other the like occasions;--and at last, inthe fire of some discussion, Sterling, who was unusually eloquent andanimated, broke out with this wild phrase, "I could plunge into thebottom of Hell, if I were sure of finding the Devil there and gettinghim strangled!"  Which produced the loudest laugh of all; and had tobe repeated, on Mrs. Crawford's inquiry, to the house at large; and,creating among the elders a kind of silent shudder,--though we urgedthat the feat would really be a good investment of humanindustry,--checked or stopt these theologic thunders for the evening.I still remember Sterling as in one of his most animated moods thatevening.  He probably returned to Herstmonceux next day, where heproposed yet to reside for some indefinite time.Arrived at Herstmonceux, he had not forgotten us.  One of his Letterswritten there soon after was the following, which much entertained me,in various ways.  It turns on a poor Book of mine, called _SartorResartus_; which was not then even a Book, but was still hangingdesolately under bibliopolic difficulties, now in its fourth or fifthyear, on the wrong side of the river, as a mere aggregate of MagazineArticles; having at last been slit into that form, and latelycompleted _so_, and put together into legibility.  I suppose Sterlinghad borrowed it of me.  The adventurous hunter spirit which hadstarted such a bemired _Auerochs_, or Urus of the German woods, anddecided on chasing that as game, struck me not a little;--and the poorWood-Ox, so bemired in the forests, took it as a compliment rather:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                            "HERSTMONCEUX near BATTLE, 29th May, 1835."MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I have now read twice, with care, the wondrousaccount of Teufelsdrockh and his Opinions; and I need not say that ithas given me much to think of.  It falls in with the feelings andtastes which were, for years, the ruling ones of my life; but whichyou will not be angry with me when I say that I am infinitely andhourly thankful for having escaped from.  Not that I think of thisstate of mind as one with which I have no longer any concern.  Thesense of a oneness of life and power in all existence; and of aboundless exuberance of beauty around us, to which most men arewell-nigh dead, is a possession which no one that has ever enjoyed itwould wish to lose.  When to this we add the deep feeling of thedifference between the actual and the ideal in Nature, and still morein Man; and bring in, to explain this, the principle of duty, as thatwhich connects us with a possible Higher State, and sets us inprogress towards it,--we have a cycle of thoughts which was the wholespiritual empire of the wisest Pagans, and which might well supplyfood for the wide speculations and richly creative fancy ofTeufelsdrockh, or his prototype Jean Paul."How then comes it, we cannot but ask, that these ideas, displayedassuredly with no want of eloquence, vivacity or earnestness, havefound, unless I am much mistaken, so little acceptance among the bestand most energetic minds in this country?  In a country where millionsread the Bible, and thousands Shakspeare; where Wordsworth circulatesthrough book-clubs and drawing-rooms; where there are innumerableadmirers of your favorite Burns; and where Coleridge, by sending fromhis solitude the voice of earnest spiritual instruction, came to bebeloved, studied and mourned for, by no small or careless school ofdisciples?--To answer this question would, of course, require morethought and knowledge than I can pretend to bring to it.  But thereare some points on which I will venture to say a few words."In the first place, as to the form of composition,--which may becalled, I think, the Rhapsodico-Reflective.  In this the _SartorResartus_ resembles some of the master-works of human invention, whichhave been acknowledged as such by many generations; and especially theworks of Rabelais, Montaigne, Sterne and Swift.  There is nothing Iknow of in Antiquity like it.  That which comes nearest is perhaps thePlatonic Dialogue.  But of this, although there is something of theplayful and fanciful on the surface, there is in reality neither inthe language (which is austerely determined to its end), nor in themethod and progression of the work, any of that headlongself-asserting capriciousness, which, if not discernible in the planof Teufelsdrockh's Memoirs, is yet plainly to be seen in the structureof the sentences, the lawless oddity, and strange heterogeneouscombination and allusion.  The principle of this difference,observable often elsewhere in modern literature (for the same thing isto be found, more or less, in many of our most genial works ofimagination,--_Don Quixote_, for instance, and the writings of JeremyTaylor), seems to be that well-known one of the predominantobjectivity of the Pagan mind; while among us the subjective has riseninto superiority, and brought with it in each individual a multitudeof peculiar associations and relations.  These, as not explicable fromany one _external_ principle assumed as a premise by the ancientphilosopher, were rejected from the sphere of his aesthetic creation:but to us they all have a value and meaning; being connected by thebond of our own personality and all alike existing in that infinitywhich is its arena."But however this may be, and comparing the Teufelsdrockhean Epopeeonly with those other modern works,--it is noticeable that Rabelais,Montaigne and Sterne have trusted for the currency of their writings,in a great degree, to the use of obscene and sensual stimulants.Rabelais, besides, was full of contemporary and personal satire; andseems to have been a champion in the great cause of his time,--as wasMontaigne also,--that of the right of thought in all competent minds,unrestrained by any outward authority.  Montaigne, moreover, containsmore pleasant and lively gossip, and more distinct good-humoredpainting of his own character and daily habits, than any other writerI know.  Sterne is never obscure, and never moral; and the costume ofhis subjects is drawn from the familiar experience of his own time andcountry:  and Swift, again, has the same merit of the clearestperspicuity, joined to that of the most homely, unaffected, forcibleEnglish.  These points of difference seem to me the chief ones whichbear against the success of the _Sartor_.  On the other hand, there isin Teufelsdrockh a depth and fervor of feeling, and a power of seriouseloquence, far beyond that of any of these four writers; and to whichindeed there is nothing at all comparable in any of them, exceptperhaps now and then, and very imperfectly, in Montaigne."Of the other points of comparison there are two which I would chieflydwell on:  and first as to the language.  A good deal of this ispositively barbarous.  'Environment,' ' vestural,' 'stertorous,''visualized,' 'complected,' and others to be found I think in thefirst twenty pages,--are words, so far as I know, without anyauthority; some of them contrary to analogy:  and none repaying bytheir value the disadvantage of novelty.  To these must be added newand erroneous locutions; 'whole other tissues' for _all the other_,and similar uses of the word _whole_; 'orients' for _pearls_; 'lucid'and 'lucent' employed as if they were different in meaning; 'hulls'perpetually for _coverings_, it being a word hardly used, and thenonly for the husk of a nut; 'to insure a man of misapprehension;''talented,' a mere newspaper and hustings word, invented, I believe,by O'Connell."I must also mention the constant recurrence of some words in a quaintand queer connection, which gives a grotesque and somewhat repulsivemannerism to many sentences.  Of these the commonest offender is'quite;' which appears in almost every page, and gives at first adroll kind of emphasis; but soon becomes wearisome.  'Nay,''manifold,' 'cunning enough significance,' 'faculty' (meaning a man'srational or moral _power_), 'special,' 'not without,' haunt the readeras if in some uneasy dream which does not rise to the dignity ofnightmare.  Some of these strange mannerisms fall under the generalhead of a singularity peculiar, so far as I know, to Teufelsdrockh.For instance, that of the incessant use of a sort of odd superfluousqualification of his assertions; which seems to give the character ofdeliberateness and caution to the style, but in time sounds like meretrick or involuntary habit.  'Almost' does more than yeoman's,_almost_ slave's service in this way.  Something similar may beremarked of the use of the double negative by way of affirmation."Under this head, of language, may be mentioned, though not withstrict grammatical accuracy, two standing characteristics of theProfessor's style,--at least as rendered into English:  _First_, thecomposition of words, such as 'snow-and-rosebloom maiden:'  anattractive damsel doubtless in Germany, but, with all her charms,somewhat uncouth here.  'Life-vision' is another example; and manymore might be found.  To say nothing of the innumerable cases in whichthe words are only intelligible as a compound term, though notdistinguished by hyphens.  Of course the composition of words issometimes allowable even in English:  but the habit of dealing withGerman seems to have produced, in the pages before us, a prodigioussuperabundance of this form of expression; which gives harshness andstrangeness, where the matter would at all events have been surprisingenough.  _Secondly_, I object, with the same qualification, to thefrequent use of _inversion_; which generally appears as atransposition of the two members of a clause, in a way which would nothave been practiced in conversation.  It certainly gives emphasis andforce, and often serves to point the meaning.  But a style may befatiguing and faulty precisely by being too emphatic, forcible andpointed; and so straining the attention to find its meaning, or theadmiration to appreciate its beauty."Another class of considerations connects itself with the heightenedand plethoric fulness of the style:  its accumulation and contrast ofimagery; its occasional jerking and almost spasmodic violence;--andabove all, the painful subjective excitement, which seems the elementand groundwork even of every description of Nature; often taking theshape of sarcasm or broad jest, but never subsiding into calm.  Thereis also a point which I should think worth attending to, were Iplanning any similar book:  I mean the importance, in a work ofimagination, of not too much disturbing in the reader's mind thebalance of the New and Old.  The former addresses itself to hisactive, the latter to his passive faculty; and these are mutuallydependent, and must coexist in certain proportion, if you wish tocombine his sympathy and progressive exertion with willingness andease of attention.  This should be taken into account in forming astyle; for of course it cannot be consciously thought of in composingeach sentence."But chiefly it seems important in determining the plan of a work.  Ifthe tone of feeling, the line of speculation are out of the commonway, and sure to present some difficulty to the average reader, thenit would probably be desirable to select, for the circumstances,drapery and accessories of all kinds, those most familiar, or at leastmost attractive.  A fable of the homeliest purport, and commonestevery-day application, derives an interest and charm from its turningon the characters and acts of gods and genii, lions and foxes, Arabsand Affghauns.  On the contrary, for philosophic inquiry and truths ofawful preciousness, I would select as my personages and interlocutorsbeings with whose language and 'whereabouts' my readers would befamiliar.  Thus did Plato in his Dialogues, Christ in his Parables.Therefore it seems doubtful whether it was judicious to make a GermanProfessor the hero of _Sartor_.  Berkeley began his _Siris_ withtar-water; but what can English readers be expected to make of_Gukguk_ by way of prelibation to your nectar and tokay?  Thecircumstances and details do not flash with living reality on theminds of your readers, but, on the contrary, themselves require someof that attention and minute speculation, the whole original stock ofwhich, in the minds of most of them, would not be too much to enablethem to follow your views of Man and Nature.  In short, there is not asufficient basis of the common to justify the amount of peculiarity inthe work.  In a book of science, these considerations would of coursebe inapplicable; but then the whole shape and coloring of the bookmust be altered to make it such; and a man who wishes merely to get atthe philosophical result, or summary of the whole, will regard thedetails and illustrations as so much unprofitable surplusage."The sense of strangeness is also awakened by the marvellouscombinations, in which the work abounds to a degree that the commonreader must find perfectly bewildering.  This can hardly, however, betreated as a consequence of the _style_; for the style in this respectcoheres with, and springs from, the whole turn and tendency ofthought.  The noblest images are objects of a humorous smile, in amind which sees itself above all Nature and throned in the arms of anAlmighty Necessity; while the meanest have a dignity, inasmuch as theyare trivial symbols of the same one life to which the great wholebelongs.  And hence, as I divine, the startling whirl of incongruousjuxtaposition, which of a truth must to many readers seem as amazingas if the Pythia on the tripod should have struck up a drinking-song,or Thersites had caught the prophetic strain of Cassandra."All this, of course, appears to me true and relevant; but I cannothelp feeling that it is, after all, but a poor piece of quackery tocomment on a multitude of phenomena without adverting to the principlewhich lies at the root, and gives the true meaning to them all.  Nowthis principle I seem to myself to find in the state of mind which isattributed to Teufelsdrockh; in his state of mind, I say, not in hisopinions, though these are, in him as in all men, mostimportant,--being one of the best indices to his state of mind.  Nowwhat distinguishes him, not merely from the greatest and best men whohave been on earth for eighteen hundred years, but from the whole bodyof those who have been working forwards towards the good, and havebeen the salt and light of the world, is this:  That he does notbelieve in a God.  Do not be indignant, I am blaming no one;--but if Iwrite my thoughts, I must write them honestly."Teufelsdrockh does not belong to the herd of sensual and thoughtlessmen; because he does perceive in all Existence a unity of power;because he does believe that this is a real power external to him anddominant to a certain extent over him, and does not think that he ishimself a shadow in a world of shadows.  He had a deep feeling of thebeautiful, the good and the true; and a faith in their final victory."At the same time, how evident is the strong inward unrest, theTitanic heaving of mountain on mountain; the storm-like rushing overland and sea in search of peace.  He writhes and roars under hisconsciousness of the difference in himself between the possible andthe actual, the hoped-for and the existent.  He feels that duty is thehighest law of his own being; and knowing how it bids the waves bestilled into an icy fixedness and grandeur, he trusts (but with aboundless inward misgiving) that there is a principle of order whichwill reduce all confusion to shape and clearness.  But wanting peacehimself, his fierce dissatisfaction fixes on all that is weak, corruptand imperfect around him; and instead of a calm and steadyco-operation with all those who are endeavoring to apply the highestideas as remedies for the worst evils, he holds himself aloof insavage isolation; and cherishes (though he dare not own) a stern joyat the prospect of that Catastrophe which is to turn loose again theelements of man's social life, and give for a time the victory toevil;--in hopes that each new convulsion of the world must bring usnearer to the ultimate restoration of all things; fancying that eachmay be the last.  Wanting the calm and cheerful reliance, which wouldbe the spring of active exertion, he flatters his own distemper bypersuading himself that his own age and generation are peculiarlyfeeble and decayed; and would even perhaps be willing to exchange therestless immaturity of our self-consciousness, and the promise of itslong throe-pangs, for the unawakened undoubting simplicity of theworld's childhood; of the times in which there was all the evil andhorror of our day, only with the difference that conscience had notarisen to try and condemn it.  In these longings, if they areTeufelsdrockh's, he seems to forget that, could we go back fivethousand years, we should only have the prospect of travelling themagain, and arriving at last at the same point at which we stand now."Something of this state of mind I may say that I understand; for Ihave myself experienced it.  And the root of the matter appears to me:A want of sympathy with the great body of those who are nowendeavoring to guide and help onward their fellow-men.  And in what isthis alienation grounded?  It is, as I believe, simply in thedifference on that point:  viz. the clear, deep, habitual recognitionof a one Living _Personal_ God, essentially good, wise, true and holy,the Author of all that exists; and a reunion with whom is the only endof all rational beings.  This belief... [_There follow now severalpages on "Personal God," and other abstruse or indeed properlyunspeakable matters; these, and a general Postscript of qualifyingpurport, I will suppress; extracting only the following fractions, asluminous or slightly significant to us:_]"Now see the difference of Teufelsdrockh's feelings.  At the end ofbook iii. chap. 8, I find these words:  'But whence?  O Heaven,whither?  Sense knows not; Faith knows not; only that it is throughmystery to mystery, from God to God.                    'We _are such stuff_     As dreams are made of, and our little life     Is rounded with a sleep.'And this tallies with the whole strain of his character.  What we findeverywhere, with an abundant use of the name of God, is the conceptionof a formless Infinite whether in time or space; of a high inscrutableNecessity, which it is the chief wisdom and virtue to submit to, whichis the mysterious impersonal base of all Existence,--shows itself inthe laws of every separate being's nature; and for man in the shape ofduty.  On the other hand, I affirm, we do know whence we come andwhither we go!--...  "And in this state of mind, as there is no true sympathy withothers, just as little is there any true peace for ourselves.  Thereis indeed possible the unsympathizing factitious calm of Art, which wefind in Goethe.  But at what expense is it bought?  Simply, byabandoning altogether the idea of duty, which is the great witness ofour personality.  And he attains his inhuman ghastly calmness byreducing the Universe to a heap of material for the idea of beauty towork on!--...  "The sum of all I have been writing as to the connection of ourfaith in God with our feeling towards men and our mode of action, mayof course be quite erroneous:  but granting its truth, it would supplythe one principle which I have been seeking for, in order to explainthe peculiarities of style in your account of Teufelsdrockh and hiswritings....  The life and works of Luther are the best comment I knowof on this doctrine of mine."Reading over what I have written, I find I have not nearly donejustice to my own sense of the genius and moral energy of the book;but this is what you will best excuse.--Believe me most sincerely andfaithfully yours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."Here are sufficient points of "discrepancy with agreement," here ismaterial for talk and argument enough; and an expanse of freediscussion open, which requires rather to be speedily restricted forconvenience' sake, than allowed to widen itself into the boundless, asit tends to do!--In all Sterling's Letters to myself and others, a large collection ofwhich now lies before me, duly copied and indexed, there is, to onethat knew his speech as well, a perhaps unusual likeness between thespeech and the Letters; and yet, for most part, with a greatinferiority on the part of these.  These, thrown off, one and all ofthem, without premeditation, and with most rapid-flowing pen, arenaturally as like his speech as writing can well be; this is theirgrand merit to us:  but on the other hand, the want of the livingtones, swift looks and motions, and manifold dramatic accompaniments,tells heavily, more heavily than common.  What can be done withchampagne itself, much more with soda-water, when the gaseous spiritis fled!  The reader, in any specimens he may see, must bear this inmind.Meanwhile these Letters do excel in honesty, in candor andtransparency; their very carelessness secures their excellence in thisrespect.  And in another much deeper and more essential respect I mustlikewise call them excellent,--in their childlike goodness, in thepurity of heart, the noble affection and fidelity they everywheremanifest in the writer.  This often touchingly strikes a familiarfriend in reading them; and will awaken reminiscences (when you havethe commentary in your own memory) which are sad and beautiful, andnot without reproach to you on occasion.  To all friends, and all goodcauses, this man is true; behind their back as before their face, thesame man!--Such traits of the autobiographic sort, from these Letters,as can serve to paint him or his life, and promise not to weary thereader, I must endeavor to select, in the sequel.CHAPTER III.BAYSWATERSterling continued to reside at Herstmonceux through the spring andsummer; holding by the peaceable retired house he still had there,till the vague future might more definitely shape itself, and betterpoint out what place of abode would suit him in his new circumstances.He made frequent brief visits to London; in which I, among otherfriends, frequently saw him, our acquaintance at each visit improvingin all ways.  Like a swift dashing meteor he came into our circle;coruscated among us, for a day or two, with sudden pleasantillumination; then again suddenly withdrew,--we hoped, not for long.I suppose, he was full of uncertainties; but undoubtedly wasgravitating towards London.  Yet, on the whole, on the surface of him,you saw no uncertainties; far from that:  it seemed always rather withperemptory resolutions, and swift express businesses, that he wascharged.  Sickly in body, the testimony said:  but here always was amind that gave you the impression of peremptory alertness, cheeryswift decision,--of a _health_ which you might have called exuberant.I remember dialogues with him, of that year; one pleasant dialogueunder the trees of the Park (where now, in 1851, is the thing called"Crystal Palace"), with the June sunset flinging long shadows for us;the last of the Quality just vanishing for dinner, and the great nightbeginning to prophesy of itself.  Our talk (like that of the foregoingLetter) was of the faults of my style, of my way of thinking, of my&c. &c.; all which admonitions and remonstrances, so friendly andinnocent, from this young junior-senior, I was willing to listen to,though unable, as usual, to get almost any practical hold of them.  Asusual, the garments do not fit you, you are lost in the garments, oryou cannot get into them at all; this is not your suit of clothes, itmust be another's:--alas, these are not your dimensions, these areonly the optical angles you subtend; on the whole, you will never getmeasured in that way!--Another time, of date probably very contiguous, I remember hearingSterling preach.  It was in some new college-chapel in Somerset-house(I suppose, what is now called King's College); a very quiet smallplace, the audience student-looking youths, with a few elder people,perhaps mostly friends of the preacher's.  The discourse, deliveredwith a grave sonorous composure, and far surpassing in talent theusual run of sermons, had withal an air of human veracity as I stillrecollect, and bespoke dignity and piety of mind:  but gave me theimpression rather of artistic excellence than of unction orinspiration in that kind.  Sterling returned with us to Chelsea thatday;--and in the afternoon we went on the Thames Putney-ward together,we two with my Wife; under the sunny skies, on the quiet water, andwith copious cheery talk, the remembrance of which is still presentenough to me.This was properly my only specimen of Sterling's preaching.  Anothertime, late in the same autumn, I did indeed attend him one evening tosome Church in the City,--a big Church behind Cheapside, "built byWren" as he carefully informed me;--but there, in my wearied mood, thechief subject of reflection was the almost total vacancy of the place,and how an eloquent soul was preaching to mere lamps and prayer-books;and of the sermon I retain no image.  It came up in the way of banter,if he ever urged the duty of "Church extension," which already he veryseldom did and at length never, what a specimen we once had of brightlamps, gilt prayer-books, baize-lined pews, Wren-built architecture;and how, in almost all directions, you might have fired a musketthrough the church, and hit no Christian life.  A terrible outlookindeed for the Apostolic laborer in the brick-and-mortar line!--In the Autumn of this same 1835, he removed permanently to London,whither all summer he had been evidently tending; took a house inBayswater, an airy suburb, half town, half country, near his Father's,and within fair distance of his other friends and objects; and decidedto await there what the ultimate developments of his course might be.His house was in Orme Square, close by the corner of that little place(which has only _three_ sides of houses); its windows looking to theeast:  the Number was, and I believe still is, No. 5.  A sufficientlycommodious, by no means sumptuous, small mansion; where, with themeans sure to him, he could calculate on finding adequate shelter forhis family, his books and himself, and live in a decent manner, in noterror of debt, for one thing.  His income, I suppose, was not large;but he lived generally a safe distance within it; and showed himselfalways as a man bountiful in money matters, and taking no thought thatway.His study-room in this house was perhaps mainly the drawing-room;looking out safe, over the little dingy grassplot in front, and thequiet little row of houses opposite, with the huge dust-whirl ofOxford Street and London far enough ahead of you as background,--asback-curtain, blotting out only _half_ your blue hemisphere with dustand smoke.  On the right, you had the continuous growl of the UxbridgeRoad and its wheels, coming as lullaby not interruption.  Leftward andrearward, after some thin belt of houses, lay mere country; brightsweeping green expanses, crowned by pleasant Hampstead, pleasantHarrow, with their rustic steeples rising against the sky.  Here onwinter evenings, the bustle of removal being all well ended, andfamily and books got planted in their new places, friends could findSterling, as they often did, who was delighted to be found by them,and would give and take, vividly as few others, an hour's good talk atany time.His outlooks, it must be admitted, were sufficiently vague andovershadowed; neither the past nor the future of a too joyful kind.Public life, in any professional form, is quite forbidden; to workwith his fellows anywhere appears to be forbidden:  nor can thehumblest solitary endeavor to work worthily as yet find an arena.  Howunfold one's little bit of talent; and live, and not lie sleeping,while it is called To-day?  As Radical, as Reforming Politician in anypublic or private form,--not only has this, in Sterling's case,received tragical sentence and execution; but the opposite extreme,the Church whither he had fled, likewise proves abortive:  the Churchalso is not the haven for him at all.  What is to be done?  Somethingmust be done, and soon,--under penalties.  Whoever has received, onhim there is an inexorable behest to give.  "_Fais ton fait_, Do thylittle stroke of work:"  this is Nature's voice, and the sum of allthe commandments, to each man!A shepherd of the people, some small Agamemnon after his sort, doingwhat little sovereignty and guidance he can in his day and generation:such every gifted soul longs, and should long, to be.  But how, in anymeasure, is the small kingdom necessary for Sterling to be attained?Not through newspapers and parliaments, not by rubrics andreading-desks:  none of the sceptres offered in the world'smarket-place, nor none of the crosiers there, it seems, can be theshepherd's-crook for this man.  A most cheerful, hoping man; and fullof swift faculty, though much lamed,--considerably bewildered too; andtending rather towards the wastes and solitary places for a home; thepaved world not being friendly to him hitherto!  The paved world, infact, both on its practical and spiritual side, slams to its doorsagainst him; indicates that he cannot enter, and even must not,--thatit will prove a choke-vault, deadly to soul and to body, if he enter.Sceptre, crosier, sheep-crook is none there for him.There remains one other implement, the resource of all Adam'sposterity that are otherwise foiled,--the Pen.  It was evident fromthis point that Sterling, however otherwise beaten about, and setfluctuating, would gravitate steadily with all his real weight towardsLiterature.  That he would gradually try with consciousness to getinto Literature; and, on the whole, never quit Literature, which wasnow all the world for him.  Such is accordingly the sum of his historyhenceforth:  such small sum, so terribly obstructed and diminished bycircumstances, is all we have realized from him.Sterling had by no means as yet consciously quitted the clericalprofession, far less the Church as a creed.  We have seen, heoccasionally officiated still in these months, when a friend requestedor an opportunity invited.  Nay it turned out afterwards, he had,unknown even to his own family, during a good many weeks in thecoldest period of next spring, when it was really dangerous for hishealth and did prove hurtful to it,--been constantly performing themorning service in some Chapel in Bayswater for a young clericalneighbor, a slight acquaintance of his, who was sickly at the time.So far as I know, this of the Bayswater Chapel in the spring of 1836,a feat severely rebuked by his Doctor withal, was his last actualservice as a churchman.  But the conscious life ecclesiastical stillhung visibly about his inner unconscious and real life, for years tocome; and not till by slow degrees he had unwinded from him thewrappages of it, could he become clear about himself, and so much astry heartily what his now sole course was.  Alas, and he had to liveall the rest of his days, as in continual flight for his veryexistence; "ducking under like a poor unfledged partridge-bird," asone described it, "before the mower; darting continually from nook tonook, and there crouching, to escape the scythe of Death."  ForLiterature Proper there was but little left in such a life.  Only thesmallest broken fractions of his last and heaviest-laden years canpoor Sterling be said to have completely lived.  His purpose had risenbefore him slowly in noble clearness; clear at last,--and even thenthe inevitable hour was at hand.In those first London months, as always afterwards while it remainedphysically possible, I saw much of him; loved him, as was natural,more and more; found in him, many ways, a beautiful acquisition to myexistence here.  He was full of bright speech and argument; radiantwith arrowy vitalities, vivacities and ingenuities.  Less than any manhe gave you the idea of ill-health.  Hopeful, sanguine; nay he did noteven seem to need definite hope, or much to form any; projectinghimself in aerial pulses like an aurora borealis, like a summer dawn,and filling all the world with present brightness for himself andothers.  Ill-health?  Nay you found at last, it was the very excess of_life_ in him that brought on disease.  This restless play of being,fit to conquer the world, could it have been held and guided, couldnot be held.  It had worn _holes_ in the outer case of it, and therefound vent for itself,--there, since not otherwise.In our many promenades and colloquies, which were of the freest, mostcopious and pleasant nature, religion often formed a topic, andperhaps towards the beginning of our intercourse was the prevailingtopic.  Sterling seemed much engrossed in matters theological, and ledthe conversation towards such; talked often about Church, ChristianityAnglican and other, how essential the belief in it to man; then, onthe other side, about Pantheism and such like;--all in the Coleridgedialect, and with eloquence and volubility to all lengths.  I rememberhis insisting often and with emphasis on what he called a "personalGod," and other high topics, of which it was not always pleasant togive account in the argumentative form, in a loud hurried voice,walking and arguing through the fields or streets.  Though of warmquick feelings, very positive in his opinions, and vehemently eager toconvince and conquer in such discussions, I seldom or never saw theleast anger in him against me or any friend.  When the blows ofcontradiction came too thick, he could with consummate dexterity whiskaside out of their way; prick into his adversary on some new quarter;or gracefully flourishing his weapon, end the duel in some handsomemanner.  One angry glance I remember in him, and it was but a glance,and gone in a moment.  "Flat Pantheism!" urged he once (which he wouldoften enough do about this time), as if triumphantly, of something orother, in the fire of a debate, in my hearing:  "It is mere Pantheism,that!"--"And suppose it were Pot-theism?" cried the other: "If thething is true!"--Sterling did look hurt at such flippant heterodoxy,for a moment.  The soul of his own creed, in those days, was far otherthan this indifference to Pot or Pan in such departments of inquiry.To me his sentiments for most part were lovable and admirable, thoughin the logical outcome there was everywhere room for opposition.  Iadmired the temper, the longing towards antique heroism, in this youngman of the nineteenth century; but saw not how, except in someGerman-English empire of the air, he was ever to realize it on thoseterms.  In fact, it became clear to me more and more that here wasnobleness of heart striving towards all nobleness; here was ardentrecognition of the worth of Christianity, for one thing; but no beliefin it at all, in my sense of the word belief,--no belief but onedefinable as mere theoretic moonshine, which would never stand thewind and weather of fact.  Nay it struck me farther that Sterling'swas not intrinsically, nor had ever been in the highest or chiefdegree, a devotional mind.  Of course all excellence in man, andworship as the supreme excellence, was part of the inheritance of thisgifted man:  but if called to define him, I should say, Artist notSaint was the real bent of his being.  He had endless admiration, butintrinsically rather a deficiency of reverence in comparison.  Fear,with its corollaries, on the religious side, he appeared to have none,nor ever to have had any.In short, it was a strange enough symptom to me of the bewilderedcondition of the world, to behold a man of this temper, and of thisveracity and nobleness, self-consecrated here, by free volition anddeliberate selection, to be a Christian Priest; and zealouslystruggling to fancy himself such in very truth.  Undoubtedly asingular present fact;--from which, as from their point ofintersection, great perplexities and aberrations in the past, andconsiderable confusions in the future might be seen ominouslyradiating.  Happily our friend, as I said, needed little hope.  To-daywith its activities was always bright and rich to him.  Hisunmanageable, dislocated, devastated world, spiritual or economical,lay all illuminated in living sunshine, making it almost beautiful tohis eyes, and gave him no hypochondria.  A richer soul, in the way ofnatural outfit for felicity, for joyful activity in this world, so faras his strength would go, was nowhere to be met with.The Letters which Mr. Hare has printed, Letters addressed, I imagine,mostly to himself, in this and the following year or two, give recordof abundant changeful plannings and laborings, on the part ofSterling; still chiefly in the theological department.  Translationfrom Tholuck, from Schleiermacher; treatise on this thing, then onthat, are on the anvil:  it is a life of abstruse vague speculations,singularly cheerful and hopeful withal, about Will, Morals, JonathanEdwards, Jewhood, Manhood, and of Books to be written on these topics.Part of which adventurous vague plans, as the Translation fromTholuck, he actually performed; other greater part, merging alwaysinto wider undertakings, remained plan merely.  I remember he talkedoften about Tholuck, Schleiermacher, and others of that stamp; andlooked disappointed, though full of good nature, at my obstinateindifference to them and their affairs.His knowledge of German Literature, very slight at this time, limiteditself altogether to writers on Church matters,--Evidences,Counter-Evidences, Theologies and Rumors of Theologies; by theTholucks, Schleiermachers, Neanders, and I know not whom.  Of the truesovereign souls of that Literature, the Goethes, Richters, Schillers,Lessings, he had as good as no knowledge; and of Goethe in particularan obstinate misconception, with proper abhorrence appended,--whichdid not abate for several years, nor quite abolish itself till a verylate period.  Till, in a word, he got Goethe's works fairly read andstudied for himself!  This was often enough the course with Sterlingin such cases.  He had a most swift glance of recognition for theworthy and for the unworthy; and was prone, in his ardent decisiveway, to put much faith in it.  "Such a one is a worthless idol; notexcellent, only sham-excellent:"  here, on this negative sideespecially, you often had to admire how right he was;--often, but notquite always.  And he would maintain, with endless ingenuity,confidence and persistence, his fallacious spectrum to be a realimage.  However, it was sure to come all right in the end.  Whateverreal excellence he might misknow, you had but to let it stand beforehim, soliciting new examination from him:  none surer than he torecognize it at last, and to pay it all his dues, with the arrears andinterest on them.  Goethe, who figures as some absurd high-stalkinghollow play-actor, or empty ornamental clock-case of an "Artist"so-called, in the Tale of the _Onyx Ring_, was in the throne ofSterling's intellectual world before all was done; and the theory of"Goethe's want of feeling," want of &c. &c. appeared to him alsoabundantly contemptible and forgettable.Sterling's days, during this time as always, were full of occupation,cheerfully interesting to himself and others; though, the wrecks oftheology so encumbering him, little fruit on the positive side couldcome of these labors.  On the negative side they were productive; andthere also, so much of encumbrance requiring removal, before fruitcould grow, there was plenty of labor needed.  He looked happy as wellas busy; roamed extensively among his friends, and loved to have themabout him,--chiefly old Cambridge comrades now settling intooccupations in the world;--and was felt by all friends, by myself asby few, to be a welcome illumination in the dim whirl of things.  Aman of altogether social and human ways; his address everywherepleasant and enlivening.  A certain smile of thin but genuinelaughter, we might say, hung gracefully over all he said anddid;--expressing gracefully, according to the model of this epoch, thestoical pococurantism which is required of the cultivated Englishman.Such laughter in him was not deep, but neither was it false (aslamentably happens often); and the cheerfulness it went to symbolizewas hearty and beautiful,--visible in the silent unsymbolized state ina still gracefuler fashion.Of wit, so far as rapid lively intellect produces wit, he had plenty,and did not abuse his endowment that way, being always fundamentallyserious in the purport of his speech:  of what we call humor, he hadsome, though little; nay of real sense for the ludicrous, in any form,he had not much for a man of his vivacity; and you remarked that hislaugh was limited in compass, and of a clear but not rich quality.  Tothe like effect shone something, a kind of childlike half-embarrassedshimmer of expression, on his fine vivid countenance; curiouslymingling with its ardors and audacities.  A beautiful childlike soul!He was naturally a favorite in conversation, especially with all whohad any funds for conversing:  frank and direct, yet polite anddelicate withal,--though at times too he could crackle with hisdexterous petulancies, making the air all like needles round you; andthere was no end to his logic when you excited it; no end, unless insome form of silence on your part.  Elderly men of reputation I havesometimes known offended by him:  for he took a frank way in thematter of talk; spoke freely out of him, freely listening to whatothers spoke, with a kind of "hail fellow well met" feeling; andcarelessly measured a men much less by his reputed account in the bankof wit, or in any other bank, than by what the man had to show forhimself in the shape of real spiritual cash on the occasion.  Butwithal there was ever a fine element of natural courtesy in Sterling;his deliberate demeanor to acknowledged superiors was fine andgraceful; his apologies and the like, when in a fit of repentance hefelt commanded to apologize, were full of naivete, and very pretty andingenuous.His circle of friends was wide enough; chiefly men of his ownstanding, old College friends many of them; some of whom have nowbecome universally known.  Among whom the most important to him wasFrederic Maurice, who had not long before removed to the Chaplaincy ofGuy's Hospital here, and was still, as he had long been, his intimateand counsellor.  Their views and articulate opinions, I suppose, werenow fast beginning to diverge; and these went on diverging far enough:but in their kindly union, in their perfect trustful familiarity,precious to both parties, there never was the least break, but asteady, equable and duly increasing current to the end.  One ofSterling's commonest expeditions, in this time, was a sally to theother side of London Bridge:  "Going to Guy's to-day."  Maurice, in ayear or two, became Sterling's brother-in-law; wedded Mrs. Sterling'syounger sister,--a gentle excellent female soul; by whom the relationwas, in many ways, strengthened and beautified for Sterling and allfriends of the parties.  With the Literary notabilities I think he hadno acquaintance; his thoughts indeed still tended rather towards acertain class of the Clerical; but neither had he much to do withthese; for he was at no time the least of a tuft-hunter, but ratherhad a marked natural indifference to _tufts_.The Rev. Mr. Dunn, a venerable and amiable Irish gentleman,"distinguished," we were told, "by having refused a bishopric:"  andwho was now living, in an opulent enough retirement, amid his booksand philosophies and friends, in London,--is memorable to me amongthis clerical class:  one of the mildest, beautifulest old men I haveever seen,--"like Fenelon," Sterling said:  his very face, with itskind true smile, with its look of suffering cheerfulness and piouswisdom, was a sort of benediction.  It is of him that Sterling writes,in the Extract which Mr. Hare, modestly reducing the name to aninitial "Mr. D.," has given us:[13]  "Mr. Dunn, for instance; thedefect of whose Theology, compounded as it is of the doctrine of theGreek Fathers, of the Mystics and of Ethical Philosophers,consists,--if I may hint a fault in one whose holiness, meekness andfervor would have made him the beloved disciple of him whom Jesusloved,--in an insufficient apprehension of the reality and depth ofSin."  A characteristic "defect" of this fine gentle soul.  On Mr.Dunn's death, which occurred two or three years later, Stirling gave,in some veiled yet transparent form, in _Blackwood's Magazine_, anaffectionate and eloquent notice of him; which, stript of the veil,was excerpted into the Newspapers also.[14]Of Coleridge there was little said.  Coleridge was now dead, not longsince; nor was his name henceforth much heard in Sterling's circle;though on occasion, for a year or two to come, he would still asserthis transcendent admiration, especially if Maurice were by to help.But he was getting into German, into various inquiries and sources ofknowledge new to him, and his admirations and notions on many thingswere silently and rapidly modifying themselves.So, amid interesting human realities, and wide cloud-canopies ofuncertain speculation, which also had their interests and theirrainbow-colors to him, and could not fail in his life just now, didSterling pass his year and half at Bayswater.  Such vaporousspeculations were inevitable for him at present; but it was to behoped they would subside by and by, and leave the sky clear.  All thiswas but the preliminary to whatever work might lie in him:--and, alas,much other interruption lay between him and that.CHAPTER V.TO MADEIRA.Sterling's dubieties as to continuing at Bordeaux were quicklydecided.  The cholera in France, the cholera in Nice, the--  In facthis moorings were now loose; and having been fairly at sea, he nevercould anchor himself here again.  Very shortly after this Letter, heleft Belsito again (for good, as it proved); and returned to Englandwith his household, there to consider what should next be done.On my return from Scotland, that year, perhaps late in September, Iremember finding him lodged straitly but cheerfully, and in happyhumor, in a little cottage on Blackheath; whither his Father one daypersuaded me to drive out with him for dinner.  Our welcome, I canstill recollect, was conspicuously cordial; the place of dinner a kindof upper room, half garret and full of books, which seemed to beJohn's place of study.  From a shelf, I remember also, the good soultook down a book modestly enough bound in three volumes, lettered onthe back Carlyle's _French Revolution_, which had been publishedlately; this he with friendly banter bade me look at as a firstsymptom, small but significant, that the book was not to die all atonce.  "One copy of it at least might hope to last the date ofsheep-leather," I admitted,--and in my then mood the little fact waswelcome.  Our dinner, frank and happy on the part of Sterling, waspeppered with abundant jolly satire from his Father:  before tea, Itook myself away; towards Woolwich, I remember, where probably therewas another call to make, and passage homeward by steamer:  Sterlingstrode along with me a good bit of road in the bright sunny evening,full of lively friendly talk, and altogether kind and amiable; andbeautifully sympathetic with the loads he thought he saw on _me_,forgetful of his own.  We shook hands on the road near the foot ofShooter's Hill:--at which point dim oblivious clouds rush down; and ofsmall or great I remember nothing more in my history or his for sometime.Besides running much about among friends, and holding counsels for themanagement of the coming winter, Sterling was now considerablyoccupied with Literature again; and indeed may be said to have alreadydefinitely taken it up as the one practical pursuit left for him.Some correspondence with _Blackwood's Magazine_ was opening itself,under promising omens:  now, and more and more henceforth, he began tolook on Literature as his real employment, after all; and wasprosecuting it with his accustomed loyalty and ardor.  And hecontinued ever afterwards, in spite of such fitful circumstances anduncertain outward fluctuations as his were sure of being, to prosecuteit steadily with all the strength he had.One evening about this time, he came down to us, to Chelsea, mostlikely by appointment and with stipulation for privacy; and read, forour opinion, his Poem of the _Sexton's Daughter_, which we now firstheard of.  The judgment in this house was friendly, but not the mostencouraging.  We found the piece monotonous, cast in the mould ofWordsworth, deficient in real human fervor or depth of melody,dallying on the borders of the infantile and "goody-good;"--in fact,involved still in the shadows of the surplice, and inculcating (onhearsay mainly) a weak morality, which he would one day find not to bemoral at all, but in good part maudlin-hypocritical and immoral.  Asindeed was to be said still of most of his performances, especiallythe poetical; a sickly _shadow_ of the parish-church still hangingover them, which he could by no means recognize for sickly._Imprimatur_ nevertheless was the concluding word,--with these graveabatements, and rhadamanthine admonitions.  To all which Sterlinglistened seriously and in the mildest humor.  His reading, it mighthave been added, had much hurt the effect of the piece:  a drearypulpit or even conventicle manner; that flattest moaning hoo-hoo ofpredetermined pathos, with a kind of rocking canter introduced by wayof intonation, each stanza the exact fellow Of the other, and the dullswing of the rocking-horse duly in each;--no reading could be moreunfavorable to Sterling's poetry than his own.  Such a mode ofreading, and indeed generally in a man of such vivacity the totalabsence of all gifts for play-acting or artistic mimicry in any kind,was a noticeable point.After much consultation, it was settled at last that Sterling shouldgo to Madeira for the winter.  One gray dull autumn afternoon, towardsthe middle of October, I remember walking with him to the eastern Dockregion, to see his ship, and how the final preparations in his ownlittle cabin were proceeding there.  A dingy little ship, the deckcrowded with packages, and bustling sailors within eight-and-fortyhours of lifting anchor; a dingy chill smoky day, as I have saidwithal, and a chaotic element and outlook, enough to make a friend'sheart sad.  I admired the cheerful careless humor and brisk activityof Sterling, who took the matter all on the sunny side, as he was wontin such cases.  We came home together in manifold talk:  he acceptedwith the due smile my last contribution to his sea-equipment, asixpenny box of German lucifers purchased on the sudden in St. James'sStreet, fit to be offered with laughter or with tears or with both; hewas to leave for Portsmouth almost immediately, and there go on board.Our next news was of his safe arrival in the temperate Isle.  Mrs.Sterling and the children were left at Knightsbridge; to pass thiswinter with his Father and Mother.At Madeira Sterling did well:  improved in health; was busy with muchLiterature; and fell in with society which he could reckon pleasant.He was much delighted with the scenery of the place; found the climatewholesome to him in a marked degree; and, with good news from home,and kindly interests here abroad, passed no disagreeable winter inthat exile.  There was talking, there was writing, there was hope ofbetter health; he rode almost daily, in cheerful busy humor, alongthose fringed shore-roads:--beautiful leafy roads and horse-paths;with here and there a wild cataract and bridge to look at; and alwayswith the soft sky overhead, the dead volcanic mountain on one hand,and broad illimitable sea spread out on the other.  Here are twoLetters which give reasonably good account of him:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                               "FUNCHAL, MADEIRA, 16th November, 1837."MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I have been writing a good many letters all in abatch, to go by the same opportunity; and I am thoroughly weary ofwriting the same things over and over again to different people.  Myletter to you therefore, I fear, must have much of the character ofremainder-biscuit.  But you will receive it as a proof that I do notwish you to forget me, though it may be useless for any other purpose."I reached this on the 2d, after a tolerably prosperous voyage,deformed by some days of sea-sickness, but otherwise not to becomplained of.  I liked my twenty fellow-passengers far better than Iexpected;--three or four of them I like much, and continue to seefrequently.  The Island too is better than I expected:  so that myBarataria at least does not disappoint me.  The bold rough mountains,with mist about their summits, verdure below, and a bright sun overall, please me much; and I ride daily on the steep and narrow pavedroads, which no wheels ever journeyed on.  The Town is clean, andthere its merits end:  but I am comfortably lodged; with a large andpleasant sitting-room to myself.  I have met with much kindness; andsee all the society I want,--though it is not quite equal to that ofLondon, even excluding Chelsea."I have got about me what Books I brought out; and have read a little,and done some writing for _Blackwood_,--all, I have the pleasure toinform you, prose, nay extremely prose.  I shall now be more atleisure; and hope to get more steadily to work; though I do not knowwhat I shall begin upon.  As to reading, I have been looking at_Goethe_, especially the _Life_,--much as a shying horse looks at apost.  In truth, I am afraid of him.  I enjoy and admire him so much,and feel I could so easily be tempted to go along with him.  And yet Ihave a deeply rooted and old persuasion that he was the most splendidof anachronisms.  A thoroughly, nay intensely Pagan Life, in an agewhen it is men's duty to be Christian.  I therefore never take him upwithout a kind of inward check, as if I were trying some forbiddenspell; while, on the other hand, there is so infinitely much to belearnt from him, and it is so needful to understand the world we livein, and our own age, and especially its greatest minds, that I cannotbring myself to burn my books as the converted Magicians did, or sinkthem as did Prospero.  There must, as I think, have been someprodigious defect in his mind, to let him hold such views as his aboutwomen and some other things; and in another respect, I find so muchcoldness and hollowness as to the highest truths, and feel so stronglythat the Heaven he looks up to is but a vault of ice,--that these twoindications, leading to the same conclusion, go far to convince me hewas a profoundly immoral and irreligious spirit, with as rarefaculties of intelligence as ever belonged to any one.  All this maybe mere _goody_ weakness and twaddle, on my part:  but it is apersuasion that I cannot escape from; though I should feel the doingso to be a deliverance from a most painful load.  If you could helpme, I heartily wish you would.  I never take him up without highadmiration, or lay him down without real sorrow for what he chose tobe."I have been reading nothing else that you would much care for.Southey's _Amadis_ has amused me; and Lyell's _Geology_ interested me.The latter gives one the same sort of bewildering view of the abysmalextent of Time that Astronomy does of Space.  I do not think I shalltake your advice as to learning Portuguese.  It is said to be very illspoken here; and assuredly it is the most direful series of nasaltwangs I ever heard.  One gets on quite well with English."The people here are, I believe, in a very low condition; but they donot appear miserable.  I am told that the influence of the priestsmakes the peasantry all Miguelites; but it is said that nobody wantsany more revolutions.  There is no appearance of riot or crime; andthey are all extremely civil.  I was much interested by learning thatColumbus once lived here, before he found America and fame.  I havebeen to see a deserted _quinta_ (country-house), where there is agreat deal of curious old sculpture, in relief, upon the masonry; manyof the figures, which are nearly as large as life, representingsoldiers clad and armed much as I should suppose those of Cortez were.There are no buildings about the Town, of the smallest pretensions tobeauty or charm of any kind.  On the whole, if Madeira were one'sworld, life would certainly rather tend to stagnate; but as atemporary refuge, a niche in an old ruin where one is sheltered fromthe shower, it has great merit.  I am more comfortable and contentedthan I expected to be, so far from home and from everybody I amclosely connected with:  but, of course, it is at best a tolerableexile."Tell Mrs. Carlyle that I have written, since I have been here, and amgoing to send to _Blackwood_, a humble imitation of her _Watch andCanary-Bird_, entitled _The Suit of Armor and the Skeleton_.[15]  I amconscious that I am far from having reached the depth and fulness ofdespair and mockery which distinguish the original!  But in truththere is a lightness of tone about her style, which I hold to beinvaluable:  where she makes hairstrokes, I make blotches.  I have avehement suspicion that my Dialogue is an entire failure; but I cannotbe plagued with it any longer.  Tell her I will not send her messages,but will write to her soon.--Meanwhile I am affectionately hers andyours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."The next is to his Brother-in-law; and in a still hopefuler tone:--                    "_To Charles Barton, Esq._[16]                                     FUNCHAL, MADEIRA, 3d March, 1838."MY DEAR CHARLES,--I have often been thinking of you and yourwhereabouts in Germany, and wishing I knew more about you; and at lastit occurred to me that you might perhaps have the same wish about me,and that therefore I should do well to write to you."I have been here exactly four months, having arrived on the 2d ofNovember,--my wedding-day; and though you perhaps may not think it acompliment to Susan, I have seldom passed four months more cheerfullyand agreeably.  I have of course felt my absence from my family, andmissed the society of my friends; for there is not a person here whomI knew before I left England.  But, on the whole, I have been in goodhealth, and actively employed.  I have a good many agreeable andvaluable acquaintances, one or two of whom I hope I may hereafterreckon as friends.  The weather has generally been fine, and nevercold; and the scenery of the Island is of a beauty which you unhappyNorthern people can have little conception of."It consists of a great mass of volcanic mountains, covered in theirlower parts with cottages, vines and patches of vegetables.  When youpass through, or over the central ridge, and get towards the North,there are woods of trees, of the laurel kind, covering the wild steepslopes, and forming some of the strangest and most beautiful prospectsI have ever seen.  Towards the interior, the forms of the hills becomemore abrupt, and loftier; and give the notion of very recent volcanicdisturbances, though in fact there has been nothing of the kind sincethe discovery of the Island by Europeans.  Among these mountains, thedark deep precipices, and narrow ravines with small streams at thebottom; the basaltic knobs and ridges on the summits; and theperpetual play of mist and cloud around them, under this bright sunand clear sky,--form landscapes which you would thoroughly enjoy, andwhich I much wish I could give you a notion of.  The Town is on thesouth, and of course the sheltered side of the Island; perfectlyprotected from the North and East; although we have seen sometimespatches of bright snow on the dark peaks in the distance.  It is aneat cheerful place; all built of gray stone, but having many of thehouses colored white or red.  There is not a really handsome buildingin it, but there is a general aspect of comfort and solidity.  Theshops are very poor.  The English do not mix at all with thePortuguese.  The Bay is a very bad anchorage; but is wide, bright andcheerful; and there are some picturesque points--one a small blackisland--scattered about it."I lived till a fortnight ago in lodgings, having two rooms, one avery good one; and paying for everything fifty-six dollars a month,the dollar being four shillings and twopence.  This you will see isdear; but I could make no better arrangement, for there is an unusualaffluence of strangers this year.  I have now come to live with afriend, a Dr. Calvert, in a small house of our own, where I am muchmore comfortable, and live greatly cheaper.  He is a friend of Mrs.Percival's; about my age, an Oriel man, and a very superior person.  Ithink the chances are, we shall go home together....  I cannot tellyou of all the other people I have become familiar with; and shallonly mention in addition Bingham Baring, eldest son of Lord Ashburton,who was here for some weeks on account of a dying brother, and whom Isaw a great deal of.  He is a pleasant, very good-natured and ratherclever man; Conservative Member for North Staffordshire."During the first two months I was here, I rode a great deal about theIsland, having a horse regularly; and was much in agreeable company,seeing a great deal of beautiful scenery.  Since then, the weather hasbeen much more unsettled, though not cold; and I have gone about less,as I cannot risk the being wet.  But I have spent my time pleasantly,reading and writing.  I have written a good many things for_Blackwood_; one of which, the _Armor and the Skeleton_, I see isprinted in the February Number.  I have just sent them a long Tale,called the _Onyx Ring_, which cost me a good deal of trouble; and theextravagance of which, I think, would amuse you; but its length mayprevent its appearance in _Blackwood_.  If so, I think I should make avolume of it.  I have also written some poems, and shall probablypublish the _Sexton's Daughter_ when I return."My health goes on most favorably.  I have had no attack of the chestthis spring; which has not happened to me since the spring before wewent to Bonn; and I am told, if I take care, I may roll along foryears.  But I have little hope of being allowed to spend the fourfirst months of any year in England; and the question will be, Whetherto go at once to Italy, by way of Germany and Switzerland, with myfamily, or to settle with them in England, perhaps at Hastings, and goabroad myself when it may be necessary.  I cannot decide till Ireturn; but I think the latter the most probable."To my dear Charles I do not like to use the ordinary forms of endinga letter, for they are very inadequate to express my sense of yourlong and most unvarying kindness; but be assured no one living couldsay with more sincerity that he is ever affectionately yours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."Other Letters give occasionally views of the shadier side of things:dark broken weather, in the sky and in the mind; ugly clouds coveringone's poor fitful transitory prospect, for a time, as they might welldo in Sterling's case.  Meanwhile we perceive his literary business isfast developing itself; amid all his confusions, he is never idlelong.  Some of his best Pieces--the Onyx _Ring_, for one, as weperceive--were written here this winter.  Out of the turbid whirlpoolof the days he strives assiduously to snatch what he can.Sterling's communications with _Blackwood's Magazine_ had now issuedin some open sanction of him by Professor Wilson, the distinguishedpresiding spirit of that Periodical; a fact naturally of highimportance to him under the literary point of view.  For Wilson, withhis clear flashing eye and great genial heart, had at once recognizedSterling; and lavished stormily, in his wild generous way, torrents ofpraise on him in the editorial comments:  which undoubtedly was one ofthe gratefulest literary baptisms, by fire or by water, that couldbefall a soul like Sterling's.  He bore it very gently, being indeedpast the age to have his head turned by anybody's praises:  nor do Ithink the exaggeration that was in these eulogies did him any illwhatever; while surely their generous encouragement did him much good,in his solitary struggle towards new activity under such impedimentsas his.  _Laudari a laudato_; to be called noble by one whom you andthe world recognize as noble:  this great satisfaction, never perhapsin such a degree before or after had now been vouchsafed to Sterling;and was, as I compute, an important fact for him.  He proceeded on hispilgrimage with new energy, and felt more and more as if authenticallyconsecrated to the same.The _Onyx Ring_, a curious Tale, with wild improbable basis, but witha noble glow of coloring and with other high merits in it, a Talestill worth reading, in which, among the imaginary characters, variousfriends of Sterling's are shadowed forth, not always in the truestmanner, came out in _Blackwood_ in the winter of this year.  Surely avery high talent for painting, both of scenery and persons, is visiblein this Fiction; the promise of a Novel such as we have few.  Butthere wants maturing, wants purifying of clear from unclear;--properlythere want patience and steady depth.  The basis, as we said, is wildand loose; and in the details, lucent often with fine color, and diptin beautiful sunshine, there are several things mis_seen_, untrue,which is the worst species of mispainting.  Witness, as Sterlinghimself would have by and by admitted, the "empty clockcase" (so wecalled it) which he has labelled Goethe,--which puts all otheruntruths in the Piece to silence.One of the great alleviations of his exile at Madeira he has alreadycelebrated to us:  the pleasant circle of society he fell into there.Great luck, thinks Sterling in this voyage; as indeed there was:  buthe himself, moreover, was readier than most men to fall into pleasantcircles everywhere, being singularly prompt to make the most of anycircle.  Some of his Madeira acquaintanceships were really good; andone of them, if not more, ripened into comradeship and friendship forhim.  He says, as we saw, "The chances are, Calvert and I will comehome together."Among the English in pursuit of health, or in flight from fataldisease, that winter, was this Dr. Calvert; an excellent ingeniouscheery Cumberland gentleman, about Sterling's age, and in a deeperstage of ailment, this not being his first visit to Madeira:  he,warmly joining himself to Sterling, as we have seen, was warmlyreceived by him; so that there soon grew a close and free intimacybetween them; which for the next three years, till poor Calvert endedhis course, was a leading element in the history of both.Companionship in incurable malady, a touching bond of union, was by nomeans purely or chiefly a companionship in misery in their case.  Thesunniest inextinguishable cheerfulness shone, through all manner ofclouds, in both.  Calvert had been travelling physician in some familyof rank, who had rewarded him with a pension, shielding his ownill-health from one sad evil.  Being hopelessly gone in pulmonarydisorder, he now moved about among friendly climates and places,seeking what alleviation there might be; often spending his summers inthe house of a sister in the environs of London; an insatiable rideron his little brown pony; always, wherever you might meet him, one ofthe cheeriest of men.  He had plenty of speculation too, clear glancesof all kinds into religious, social, moral concerns; and pleasantlyincited Sterling's outpourings on such subjects.  He could report offashionable persons and manners, in a fine human Cumberland manner;loved art, a great collector of drawings; he had endless help andingenuity; and was in short every way a very human, lovable, good andnimble man,--the laughing blue eyes of him, the clear cheery soul ofhim, still redolent of the fresh Northern breezes and transparentMountain streams.  With this Calvert, Sterling formed a naturalintimacy; and they were to each other a great possession, mutuallyenlivening many a dark day during the next three years.  They did comehome together this spring; and subsequently made several of thesehealth-journeys in partnership.CHAPTER VI.LITERATURE:  THE STERLING CLUB.In spite of these wanderings, Sterling's course in life, so far as hispoor life could have any course or aim beyond that of screening itselffrom swift death, was getting more and more clear to him; and hepursued it diligently, in the only way permitted him, by hastysnatches, in the intervals of continual fluctuation, change of placeand other interruption.Such, once for all, were the conditions appointed him.  And it must beowned he had, with a most kindly temper, adjusted himself to these;nay you would have said, he loved them; it was almost as if he wouldhave chosen them as the suitablest.  Such an adaptation was there inhim of volition to necessity:--for indeed they both, if well seeninto, proceeded from one source.  Sterling's bodily disease was theexpression, under physical conditions, of the too vehement life which,under the moral, the intellectual and other aspects, incessantlystruggled within him.  Too vehement;--which would have required aframe of oak and iron to contain it:  in a thin though most wiry bodyof flesh and bone, it incessantly "wore holes," and so found outletfor itself.  He could take no rest, he had never learned that art; hewas, as we often reproached him, fatally incapable of sitting still.Rapidity, as of pulsing auroras, as of dancing lightnings:  rapidityin all forms characterized him.  This, which was his bane, in manysenses, being the real origin of his disorder, and of such continualnecessity to move and change,--was also his antidote, so far asantidote there might be; enabling him to love change, and to snatch,as few others could have done, from the waste chaotic years, alltumbled into ruin by incessant change, what hours and minutes ofavailable turned up.  He had an incredible facility of labor. Heflashed with most piercing glance into a subject; gathered it up intoorganic utterability, with truly wonderful despatch, considering thesuccess and truth attained; and threw it on paper with a swiftfelicity, ingenuity, brilliancy and general excellence, of which,under such conditions of swiftness, I have never seen a parallel.Essentially an _improviser_ genius; as his Father too was, and ofadmirable completeness he too, though under a very different form.If Sterling has done little in Literature, we may ask, What other manthan he, in such circumstances, could have done anything?  In virtueof these rapid faculties, which otherwise cost him so dear, he hasbuilt together, out of those wavering boiling quicksands of his fewlater years, a result which may justly surprise us.  There is actuallysome result in those poor Two Volumes gathered from him, such as theyare; he that reads there will not wholly lose his time, nor rise witha malison instead of a blessing on the writer.  Here actually is areal seer-glance, of some compass, into the world of our day; blessedglance, once more, of an eye that is human; truer than one of athousand, and beautifully capable of making others see with it.  Ihave known considerable temporary reputations gained, considerablepiles of temporary guineas, with loud reviewing and the like to match,on a far less basis than lies in those two volumes.  Those also, Iexpect, will be held in memory by the world, one way or other, tillthe world has extracted all its benefit from them.  Graceful,ingenious and illuminative reading, of their sort, for all manner ofinquiring souls.  A little verdant flowery island of poetic intellect,of melodious human verity; sunlit island founded on the rocks;--whichthe enormous circumambient continents of mown reed-grass and floatinglumber, with _their_ mountain-ranges of ejected stable-litter howeveralpine, cannot by any means or chance submerge:  nay, I expect, theywill not even quite hide it, this modest little island, from thewell-discerning; but will float past it towards the place appointedfor them, and leave said island standing.  _Allah kereem_, say theArabs!  And of the English also some still know that there is a,difference in the material of mountains!--As it is this last little result, the amount of his poor andever-interrupted literary labor, that henceforth forms the essentialhistory of Sterling, we need not dwell at too much length on theforeign journeys, disanchorings, and nomadic vicissitudes ofhousehold, which occupy his few remaining years, and which are onlythe disastrous and accidental arena of this.  He had now, excludinghis early and more deliberate residence in the West Indies, made twoflights abroad, once with his family, once without, in search ofhealth.  He had two more, in rapid succession, to make, and many moreto meditate; and in the whole from Bayswater to the end, his familymade no fewer than five complete changes of abode, for his sake.  Butthese cannot be accepted as in any sense epochs in his life:  the onelast epoch of his life was that of his internal change towardsLiterature as his work in the world; and we need not linger much onthese, which are the mere outer accidents of that, and had nodistinguished influence in modifying that.Friends still hoped the unrest of that brilliant too rapid soul wouldabate with years.  Nay the doctors sometimes promised, on the physicalside, a like result; prophesying that, at forty-five or some matureage, the stress of disease might quit the lungs, and direct itself toother quarters of the system.  But no such result was appointed forus; neither forty-five itself, nor the ameliorations promised then,were ever to be reached.  Four voyages abroad, three of them withouthis family, in flight from death; and at home, for a like reason, fivecomplete shiftings of abode:  in such wandering manner, and nototherwise, had Sterling to continue his pilgrimage till it ended.Once more I must say, his cheerfulness throughout was wonderful.  Acertain grimmer shade, coming gradually over him, might perhaps benoticed in the concluding years; not impatience properly, yet theconsciousness how much he needed patience; something more caustic inhis tone of wit, more trenchant and indignant occasionally in his toneof speech:  but at no moment was his activity bewildered or abated,nor did his composure ever give way.  No; both his activity and hiscomposure he bore with him, through all weathers, to the final close;and on the whole, right manfully he walked his wild stern way towardsthe goal, and like a Roman wrapt his mantle round him when hefell.--Let us glance, with brevity, at what he saw and suffered in hisremaining pilgrimings and chargings; and count up what fractions ofspiritual fruit he realized to us from them.Calvert and he returned from Madeira in the spring of 1838.  Mrs.Sterling and the family had lived in Knightsbridge with his Father'speople through the winter:  they now changed to Blackheath, orultimately Hastings, and he with them, coming up to London prettyoften; uncertain what was to be done for next winter.  Literature wenton briskly here:  _Blackwood_ had from him, besides the _Onyx Ring_which soon came out with due honor, assiduous almost monthlycontributions in prose and verse.  The series called _Hymns of aHermit_ was now going on; eloquent melodies, tainted to me withsomething of the same disease as the _Sexton's Daughter_, thoughperhaps in a less degree, considering that the strain was in a so muchhigher pitch.  Still better, in clear eloquent prose, the series ofdetached thoughts, entitled _Crystals from a Cavern_; of which the setof fragments, generally a little larger in compass, called _Thoughtsand Images_, and again those called _Sayings and Essayings_,[17] areproperly continuations.  Add to which, his friend John Mill had nowcharge of a Review, _The London and Westminster_ its name; whereinSterling's assistance, ardently desired, was freely afforded, withsatisfaction to both parties, in this and the following years.  AnEssay on _Montaigne_, with the notes and reminiscences already spokenof, was Sterling's first contribution here; then one on_Simonides_:[18]   both of the present season.On these and other businesses, slight or important, he was oftenrunning up to London; and gave us almost the feeling of his beingresident among us.  In order to meet the most or a good many of hisfriends at once on such occasions, he now furthermore contrived thescheme of a little Club, where monthly over a frugal dinner somereunion might take place; that is, where friends of his, and withalsuch friends of theirs as suited,--and in fine, where a small selectcompany definable as persons to whom it was pleasant to talktogether,--might have a little opportunity of talking.  The scheme wasapproved by the persons concerned:  I have a copy of the OriginalRegulations, probably drawn up by Sterling, a very solid lucid pieceof economics; and the List of the proposed Members, signed "JamesSpedding, Secretary," and dated "8th August, 1838."[19]  The Club grew;was at first called the _Anonymous Club_; then, after some months ofsuccess, in compliment to the founder who had now left us again, the_Sterling Club_;--under which latter name, it once lately, for a time,owing to the Religious Newspapers, became rather famous in the world!In which strange circumstances the name was again altered, to suitweak brethren; and the Club still subsists, in a sufficientlyflourishing though happily once more a private condition.  That is theorigin and genesis of poor Sterling's Club; which, having honestlypaid the shot for itself at Will's Coffee-house or elsewhere, rashlyfancied its bits of affairs were quite settled; and once littlethought of getting into Books of History with them!--But now, Autumn approaching, Sterling had to quit Clubs, for mattersof sadder consideration.  A new removal, what we call "his thirdperegrinity," had to be decided on; and it was resolved that Romeshould be the goal of it, the journey to be done in company withCalvert, whom also the Italian climate might be made to serve insteadof Madeira.  One of the liveliest recollections I have, connected withthe _Anonymous Club_, is that of once escorting Sterling, after acertain meeting there, which I had seen only towards the end, and nowremember nothing of,--except that, on breaking up, he proved to beencumbered with a carpet-bag, and could not at once find a cab forKnightsbridge.  Some small bantering hereupon, during the instants ofembargo.  But we carried his carpet-bag, slinging it on my stick, twoor three of us alternately, through dusty vacant streets, under thegaslights and the stars, towards the surest cab-stand; still jesting,or pretending to jest, he and we, not in the mirthfulest manner; andhad (I suppose) our own feelings about the poor Pilgrim, who was to goon the morrow, and had hurried to meet us in this way, as the lastthing before leaving England.CHAPTER VII.ITALY.The journey to Italy was undertaken by advice of Sir James Clark,reckoned the chief authority in pulmonary therapeutics; who prophesiedimportant improvements from it, and perhaps even the possibilityhenceforth of living all the year in some English home.  Mrs. Sterlingand the children continued in a house avowedly temporary, a furnishedhouse at Hastings, through the winter.  The two friends had set offfor Belgium, while the due warmth was still in the air.  Theytraversed Belgium, looking well at pictures and such objects; ascendedthe Rhine; rapidly traversed Switzerland and the Alps; issuing uponItaly and Milan, with immense appetite for pictures, and time still togratify themselves in that pursuit, and be deliberate in theirapproach to Rome.  We will take this free-flowing sketch of theirpassage over the Alps; written amid "the rocks of Arona,"--SantoBorromeo's country, and poor little Mignon's!  The "elder Perdonnets"are opulent Lausanne people, to whose late son Sterling had been verykind in Madeira the year before:--              "_To Mrs. Sterling, Knightsbridge, London_.                          "ARONA on the LAGO MAGGIORE, 8th Oct., 1838."MY DEAR MOTHER,--I bring down the story of my proceedings to thepresent time since the 29th of September.  I think it must have beenafter that day that I was at a great breakfast at the elderPerdonnets', with whom I had declined to dine, not choosing to go outat night....  I was taken by my hostess to see several prettypleasure-grounds and points of view in the neighborhood; and latterlyCalvert was better, and able to go with us.  He was in force again,and our passports were all settled so as to enable us to start on themorning of the 2d, after taking leave of our kind entertainer withthanks for her infinite kindness."We reached St. Maurice early that evening; having had the Dent duMidi close to us for several hours; glittering like the top of asilver teapot, far up in the sky.  Our course lay along the Valley ofthe Rhone; which is considered one of the least beautiful parts ofSwitzerland, and perhaps for this reason pleased us, as we had notbeen prepared to expect much.  We saw, before reaching the foot of theAlpine pass at Brieg, two rather celebrated Waterfalls; the one thePissevache, which has no more beauty than any waterfall one hundred ortwo hundred feet high must necessarily have:  the other, nearTourtemagne, is much more pleasing, having foliage round it, and beingin a secluded dell.  If you buy a Swiss Waterfall, choose this one."Our second day took us through Martigny to Sion, celebrated for itspicturesque towers upon detached hills, for its strong Romanism andits population of _cretins_,--that is, maimed idiots having the_goitre_.  It looked to us a more thriving place than we expected.They are building a great deal; among other things, a new Bishop'sPalace and a new Nunnery,--to inhabit either of which _ex officio_ Ifeel myself very unsuitable.  From Sion we came to Brieg; a littlevillage in a nook, close under an enormous mountain and glacier, whereit lies like a molehill, or something smaller, at the foot of ahaystack.  Here also we slept; and the next day our voiturier, who hadbrought us from Lausanne, started with us up the Simplon Pass; helpedon by two extra horses."The beginning of the road was rather cheerful; having a good deal ofgreen pasturage, and some mountain villages; but it soon becomesdreary and savage in aspect, and but for our bright sky and warm air,would have been truly dismal.  However, we gained gradually a distinctand near view of several large glaciers; and reached at last the highand melancholy valleys of the Upper Alps; where even the pines becomescanty, and no sound is heard but the wheels of one's carriage, exceptwhen there happens to be a storm or an avalanche, neither of whichentertained us.  There is, here and there, a small stream of waterpouring from the snow; but this is rather a monotonous accompanimentto the general desolation than an interruption of it.  The road itselfis certainly very good, and impresses one with a strong notion ofhuman power.  But the common descriptions are much exaggerated; andmany of what the Guide-Books call 'galleries' are merely parts of theroad supported by a wall built against the rock, and have nothing likea roof above them.  The 'stupendous bridges,' as they are called,might be packed, a dozen together, into one arch of London Bridge; andthey are seldom even very striking from the depth below.  The roadwayis excellent, and kept in the best order.  On the whole, I am veryglad to have travelled the most famous road in Europe, and to have haddelightful weather for doing so, as indeed we have had ever since weleft Lausanne.  The Italian descent is greatly more remarkable thanthe other side."We slept near the top, at the Village of Simplon, in a very fair andwell-warmed inn, close to a mountain stream, which is one of the greatornaments of this side of the road.  We have here passed into a regionof granite, from that of limestone, and what is called gneiss.  Thevalleys are sharper and closer,--like cracks in a hard and solidmass;--and there is much more of the startling contrast of light andshade, as well as more angular boldness of outline; to all which themore abundant waters add a fresh and vivacious interest.  Looking backthrough one of these abysmal gorges, one sees two torrents dashingtogether, the precipice and ridge on one side, pitch-black with shade;and that on the other all flaming gold; while behind rises, in a hugecone, one of the glacier summits of the chain.  The stream at one'sfeet rushes at a leap some two hundred feet down, and is bordered withpines and beeches, struggling through a ruined world of clefts andboulders.  I never saw anything so much resembling some of the_Circles_ described by Dante.  From Simplon we made for Duomod'Ossola; having broken out, as through the mouth of a mine, intogreen and fertile valleys full of vines and chestnuts, and whitevillages,--in short, into sunshine and Italy."At this place we dismissed our Swiss voiturier, and took an Italianone; who conveyed us to Omegna on the Lake of Orta; a place littlevisited by English travellers, but which fully repaid us the troubleof going there.  We were lodged in a simple and even rude Italian inn;where they cannot speak a word of French; where we occupied abarn-like room, with a huge chimney fit to lodge a hundred ghosts,whom we expelled by dint of a hot woodfire.  There were two beds, andas it happened good ones, in this strange old apartment; which wasadorned by pictures of Architecture, and by Heads of Saints, betterthan many at the Royal Academy Exhibition, and which one paid nothingfor looking at.  The thorough Italian character of the whole sceneamused us, much more than Meurice's at Paris would have done; for wehad voluble, commonplace good-humor, with the aspect and accessoriesof a den of banditti."To-day we have seen the Lake of Orta, have walked for some milesamong its vineyards and chestnuts; and thence have come, by Baveno, tothis place;--having seen by the way, I believe, the most beautifulpart of the Lago Maggiore, and certainly the most cheerful, completeand extended example of fine scenery I have ever fallen in with.  Herewe are, much to my wonder,--for it seems too good to be true,--fairlyin Italy; and as yet my journey has been a pleasanter and moreinstructive, and in point of health a more successful one, than I atall imagined possible.  Calvert and I go on as well as can be.  I lethim have his way about natural science, and he only laughs benignlywhen he thinks me absurd in my moral speculations.  My only regretsare caused by my separation from my family and friends, and by thehurry I have been living in, which has prevented me doing anywork,--and compelled me to write to you at a good deal faster ratethan the _vapore_ moves on the Lago Maggiore.  It will take meto-morrow to Sesto Calende, whence we go to Varese.  We shall not beat Milan for some days.  Write thither, if you are kind enough towrite at all, till I give you another address.  Love to my Father.                        "Your affectionate son,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."Omitting Milan, Florence nearly all, and much about "Art," MichaelAngelo, and other aerial matters, here are some select terrestrialglimpses, the fittest I can find, of his progress towards Rome:--                           _To his Mother_."_Lucca, Nov.  27th_, 1838.--I had dreams, like other people, before Icame here, of what the Lombard Lakes must be; and the week I spentamong them has left me an image, not only more distinct, but far morewarm, shining and various, and more deeply attractive in innumerablerespects, than all I had before conceived of them.  And so also it hasbeen with Florence; where I spent three weeks:  enough for the firsthazy radiant dawn of sympathy to pass away; yet constantly adding anincrease of knowledge and of love, while I examined, and tried tounderstand, the wonderful minds that have left behind them there suchabundant traces of their presence....  On Sunday, the day before Ileft Florence, I went to the highest part of the Grand Duke's Gardenof Boboli, which commands a view of most of the City, and of the valeof the Arno to the westward; where, as we had been visited by severalrainy days, and now at last had a very fine one, the whole prospectwas in its highest beauty.  The mass of buildings, chiefly on theother side of the River, is sufficient to fill the eye, withoutperplexing the mind by vastness like that of London; and its name andhistory, its outline and large and picturesque buildings, give itgrandeur of a higher order than that of mere multitudinous extent.The Hills that border the Valley of the Arno are also very pleasingand striking to look upon; and the view of the rich Plain, glimmeringaway into blue distance, covered with an endless web of villages andcountry-houses, is one of the most delightful images of humanwell-being I have ever seen...."Very shortly before leaving Florence, I went through the house ofMichael Angelo; which is still possessed by persons of the samefamily, descendants, I believe, of his Nephew.  There is in it his'first work in marble,' as it is called; and a few drawings,--all withthe stamp of his enginery upon them, which was more powerful than allthe steam in London....  On the whole, though I have done no work inFlorence that can be of any use or pleasure to others, except myLetters to my Wife,--I leave it with the certainty of much valuableknowledge gained there, and with a most pleasant remembrance of thebusy and thoughtful days I owe to it."We left Florence before seven yesterday morning [26th November] forthis place; travelling on the northern side of the Arno, by Prato,Pistoia, Pescia.  We tried to see some old frescos in a Church atPrato; but found the Priests all about, saying mass; and of course didnot venture to put our hands into a hive where the bees were buzzingand on the wing.  Pistoia we only coasted.  A little on one side ofit, there is a Hill, the first on the road from Florence; which wewalked up, and had a very lively and brilliant prospect over the roadwe had just travelled, and the town of Pistoia.  Thence to this placethe whole land is beautiful, and in the highest degree prosperous,--inshort, to speak metaphorically, all dotted with Leghorn bonnets, andstreaming with olive-oil.  The girls here are said to employthemselves chiefly in platting straw, which is a profitableemployment; and the slightness and quiet of the work are said to bemuch more favorable to beauty than the coarser kinds of laborperformed by the country-women elsewhere.  Certain it is that I sawmore pretty women in Pescia, in the hour I spent there, than I everbefore met with among the same numbers of the 'phare sect.'Wherefore, as a memorial of them, I bought there several Legends ofFemale Saints and Martyrs, and of other Ladies quite the reverse, andheld up as warnings; all of which are written in _ottava rima_, andsold for three halfpence apiece.  But unhappily I have not yet hadtime to read them.  This Town has 30,000 inhabitants, and issurrounded by Walls, laid out as walks, and evidently not at presentintended to be besieged,--for which reason, this morning, I merelywalked on them round the Town, and did not besiege them...."The Cathedral [of Lucca] contains some Relics; which have undoubtedlyworked miracles on the imagination of the people hereabouts.  TheGrandfather of all Relics (as the Arabs would say) in the place is the_Volto Santo_, which is a Face of the Saviour appertaining to a woodenCrucifix.  Now you must know that, after the ascension of Christ,Nicodemus was ordered by an Angel to carve an image of him; and wentaccordingly with a hatchet, and cut down a cedar for that purpose.  Hethen proceeded to carve the figure; and being tired, fell asleepbefore he had done the face; which however, on awaking, he foundcompleted by celestial aid.  This image was brought to Lucca, fromLeghorn, I think, where it had arrived in a ship, 'more than athousand years ago,' and has ever since been kept, in purple and finelinen and gold and diamonds, quietly working miracles.  I saw the giltShrine of it; and also a Hatchet which refused to cut off the head ofan innocent man, who had been condemned to death, and who prayed tothe _Volto Santo_.  I suppose it is by way of economy (they being afrugal people) that the Italians have their Book of Common Prayer andtheir Arabian Nights' Entertainments condensed into one."                            _To the Same_."_Pisa, December 2d_, 1838.--Pisa is very unfairly treated in all theBooks I have read.  It seems to me a quiet, but very agreeable place;with wide clean streets, and a look of stability and comfort; and Iadmire the Cathedral and its appendages more, the more I see them.The leaning of the Tower is to my eye decidedly unpleasant; but it isa beautiful building nevertheless, and the view from the top is, undera bright sky, remarkably lively and satisfactory.  The Lucchese Hillsform a fine mass, and the sea must in clear weather be very distinct.There was some haze over it when I was up, though the land was allclear.  I could just see the Leghorn Light-house.  Leghorn itself Ishall not be able to visit...."The quiet gracefulness of Italian life, and the mental maturity andvigor of Germany, have a great charm when compared with the restlesswhirl of England, and the chorus of mingled yells and groans sent upby our parties and sects, and by the suffering and bewildered crowdsof the laboring people.  Our politics make my heart ache, whenever Ithink of them.  The base selfish frenzies of factions seem to me, atthis distance, half diabolic; and I am out of the way of knowinganything that may be quietly a-doing to elevate the standard of wiseand temperate manhood in the country, and to diffuse the means ofphysical and moral well-being among all the people....  I will writeto my Father as soon as I can after reaching the capital of his friendthe Pope,--who, if he had happened to be born an English gentleman,would no doubt by this time be a respectable old-gentlemanly goutymember of the Carlton.  I have often amused myself by thinking what amere accident it is that Phillpotts is not Archbishop of Tuam, andM'Hale Bishop of Exeter; and how slight a change of dress, and of afew catchwords, would even now enable them to fill those respectiveposts with all the propriety and discretion they display in theirpresent positions."At Rome he found the Crawfords, known to him long since; and atdifferent dates other English friends old and new; and was altogetherin the liveliest humor, no end to his activities and speculations.  Ofall which, during the next four months, the Letters now before me giveabundant record,--far too abundant for our objects here.  His grandpursuit, as natural at Rome, was Art; into which metaphysical domainwe shall not follow him; preferring to pick out, here and there,something of concrete and human.  Of his interests, researches,speculations and descriptions on this subject of Art, there is alwaysrather a superabundance, especially in the Italian Tour.Unfortunately, in the hard weather, poor Calvert fell ill; andSterling, along with his Art-studies, distinguished himself as asick-nurse till his poor comrade got afoot again.  His generalimpressions of the scene and what it held for him may be read in thefollowing excerpts.  The Letters are all dated _Rome_, and addressedto his Father or Mother:--"_December 21st_, 1838.--Of Rome itself, as a whole, there areinfinite things to be said, well worth saying; but I shall confinemyself to two remarks:  first, that while the Monuments and works ofArt gain in wondrousness and significance by familiarity with them,the actual life of Rome, the Papacy and its pride, lose; and thoughone gets accustomed to Cardinals and Friars and Swiss Guards, andragged beggars and the finery of London and Paris, all rolling ontogether, and sees how it is that they subsist in a sort of spuriousunity, one loses all tendency to idealize the Metropolis and System ofthe Hierarchy into anything higher than a piece of showystage-declamation, at bottom, in our day, thoroughly mean and prosaic.My other remark is, that Rome, seen from the tower of the Capitol,from the Pincian or the Janiculum, is at this day one of the mostbeautiful spectacles which eyes ever beheld.  The company of greatdomes rising from a mass of large and solid buildings, with a fewstone-pines and scattered edifices on the outskirts; the broken bareCampagna all around; the Alban Hills not far, and the purple range ofSabine Mountains in the distance with a cope of snow;--this seen inthe clear air, and the whole spiritualized by endless recollections,and a sense of the grave and lofty reality of human existence whichhas had this place for a main theatre, fills at once the eyes andheart more forcibly, and to me delightfully, than I can find words tosay.""_January 22d_, 1839.--The Modern Rome, Pope and all inclusive, are ashabby attempt at something adequate to fill the place of the oldCommonwealth.  It is easy enough to live among them, and there is muchto amuse and even interest a spectator; but the native existence ofthe place is now thin and hollow, and there is a stamp of littleness,and childish poverty of taste, upon all the great Christian buildingsI have seen here,--not excepting St. Peter's; which is crammed withbits of colored marble and gilding, and Gog-and-Magog colossal statuesof saints (looking prodigiously small), and mosaics from the worstpictures in Rome; and has altogether, with most imposing size andlavish splendor, a tang of Guildhall finery about it that contrastsoddly with the melancholy vastness and simplicity of the AncientMonuments, though these have not the Athenian elegance.  I recurperpetually to the galleries of Sculpture in the Vatican, and to theFrescos of Raffael and Michael Angelo, of inexhaustible beauty andgreatness, and to the general aspect of the City and the Country roundit, as the most impressive scene on earth.  But the Modern City, withits churches, palaces, priests and beggars, is far from sublime."Of about the same date, here is another paragraph worth inserting:"Gladstone has three little agate crosses which he will give you formy little girls.  Calvert bought them, as a present, for 'the bodies,'at Martigny in Switzerland, and I have had no earlier opportunity ofsending them.  Will you despatch them to Hastings when you have anopportunity?  I have not yet seen Gladstone's _Church and State_; butas there is a copy in Rome, I hope soon to lay hands on it.  I sawyesterday in the _Times_ a furious, and I am sorry to say, most absurdattack on him and it, and the new Oxonian school.""_February 28th, 1839_.--There is among the people plenty of squalidmisery; though not nearly so much as, they say, exists in Ireland; andhere there is a certain freedom and freshness of manners, a dash ofSouthern enjoyment in the condition of the meanest and most miserable.There is, I suppose, as little as well can be of conscience orartificial cultivation of any kind; but there is not the affectationof a virtue which they do not possess, nor any feeling of beingdespised for the want of it; and where life generally is so inert,except as to its passions and material wants, there is not the bitterconsciousness of having been beaten by the more prosperous, in a racewhich the greater number have never thought of running.  Among thelaboring poor of Rome, a bribe will buy a crime; but if common workprocures enough for a day's food or idleness, ten times the sum willnot induce them to toil on, as an English workman would, for the sakeof rising in the world.  Sixpence any day will put any of them at thetop of the only tree they care for,--that on which grows the fruit ofidleness.  It is striking to see the way in which, in magnificentchurches, the most ragged beggars kneel on the pavement before somefavorite altar in the midst of well-dressed women and of gazingforeigners.  Or sometimes you will see one with a child come in fromthe street where she has been begging, put herself in a corner, say aprayer (probably for the success of her petitions), and then return tobeg again.  There is wonderfully little of any moral strengthconnected with this devotion; but still it is better than nothing, andmore than is often found among the men of the upper classes in Rome.I believe the Clergy to be generally profligate, and the state ofdomestic morals as bad as it has ever been represented."--Or, in sudden contrast, take this other glance homeward; a Letter tohis eldest child; in which kind of Letters, more than in any other,Sterling seems to me to excel.  Readers recollect the hurricane in St.Vincent; the hasty removal to a neighbor's house, and the birth of ason there, soon after.  The boy has grown to some articulation, duringthese seven years; and his Father, from the new foreign scene ofPriests and Dilettanti, thus addresses him:--              "_To Master Edward C. Sterling, Hastings_.                                            "ROME, 21st January, 1839."MY DEAR EDWARD,--I was very glad to receive your Letter, which showedme that you have learned something since I left home.  If you knew howmuch pleasure it gave me to see your handwriting, I am sure you wouldtake pains to be able to write well, that you might often send meletters, and tell me a great many things which I should like to knowabout Mamma and your Sisters as well as yourself."If I go to Vesuvius, I will try to carry away a bit of the lava,which you wish for.  There has lately been a great eruption, as it iscalled, of that Mountain; which means a great breaking-out of hotashes and fire, and of melted stones which is called lava."Miss Clark is very kind to take so much pains with you; and I trustyou will show that you are obliged to her, by paying attention to allshe tells you.  When you see how much more grown people know than you,you ought to be anxious to learn all you can from those who teach you;and as there are so many wise and good things written in Books, youought to try to read early and carefully; that you may learn somethingof what God has made you able to know.  There are Libraries containingvery many thousands of Volumes; and all that is written in theseis,--accounts of some part or other of the World which God has made,or of the Thoughts which he has enabled men to have in their minds.Some Books are descriptions of the earth itself, with its rocks andground and water, and of the air and clouds, and the stars and moonand sun, which shine so beautifully in the sky.  Some tell you aboutthe things that grow upon the ground; the many millions of plants,from little mosses and threads of grass up to great trees and forests.Some also contain accounts of living things:  flies, worms, fishes,birds and four-legged beasts.  And some, which are the most, are aboutmen and their thoughts and doings.  These are the most important ofall; for men are the best and most wonderful creatures of God in theworld; being the only ones able to know him and love him, and to tryof their own accord to do his will."These Books about men are also the most important to us, because weourselves are human beings, and may learn from such Books what weought to think and to do and to try to be.  Some of them describe whatsort of people have lived in old times and in other countries.  Byreading them, we know what is the difference between ourselves inEngland now, and the famous nations which lived in former days.  Suchwere the Egyptians who built the Pyramids, which are the greatestheaps of stone upon the face of the earth: and the Babylonians, whohad a city with huge walls, built of bricks, having writing on themthat no one in our time has been able to make out.  There were alsothe Jews, who were the only ancient people that knew how wonderful andhow good God is:  and the Greeks, who were the wisest of all inthinking about men's lives and hearts, and who knew best how to makefine statues and buildings, and to write wise books.  By Books also wemay learn what sort of people the old Romans were, whose chief citywas Rome, where I am now; and how brave and skilful they were in war;and how well they could govern and teach many nations which they hadconquered.  It is from Books, too, that you must learn what kind ofmen were our Ancestors in the Northern part of Europe, who belonged tothe tribes that did the most towards pulling down the power of theRomans: and you will see in the same way how Christianity was sentamong them by God, to make them wiser and more peaceful, and morenoble in their minds; and how all the nations that now are in Europe,and especially the Italians and the Germans, and the French and theEnglish, came to be what they now are.--It is well worth knowing (andit can be known only by reading) how the Germans found out thePrinting of Books, and what great changes this has made in the world.And everybody in England ought to try to understand how the Englishcame to have their Parliaments and Laws; and to have fleets that sailover all seas of the world."Besides learning all these things, and a great many more aboutdifferent times and countries, you may learn from Books, what is thetruth of God's will, and what are the best and wisest thoughts, andthe most beautiful words; and how men are able to lead very rightlives, and to do a great deal to better the world.  I have spent agreat part of my life in reading; and I hope you will come to like itas much as I do, and to learn in this way all that I know."But it is a still more serious matter that you should try to beobedient and gentle; and to command your temper; and to think of otherpeople's pleasure rather than your own, and of what you _ought_ to dorather than what you _like_.  If you try to be better for all youread, as well as wiser, you will find Books a great help towardsgoodness as well as knowledge, and above all other Books, the Bible;which tells us of the will of God, and of the love of Jesus Christtowards God and men."I had a Letter from Mamma to-day, which left Hastings on the 10th ofthis month.  I was very glad to find in it that you were all well andhappy; but I know Mamma is not well, and is likely to be moreuncomfortable every day for some time.  So I hope you will all takecare to give her as little trouble as possible.  After sending you somuch advice, I shall write a little Story to divert you.--I am, mydear Boy,                      "Your affectionate Father,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."The "Story" is lost, destroyed, as are many such which Sterling wrote,with great felicity, I am told, and much to the satisfaction of theyoung folk, when the humor took him.Besides these plentiful communications still left, I remember longLetters, not now extant, principally addressed to his Wife, of whichwe and the circle at Knightsbridge had due perusal, treating withanimated copiousness about all manner of picture-galleries, pictures,statues and objects of Art at Rome, and on the road to Rome and fromit, wheresoever his course led him into neighborhood of such objects.That was Sterling's habit.  It is expected in this Nineteenth Centurythat a man of culture shall understand and worship Art:  among thewindy gospels addressed to our poor Century there are few louder thanthis of Art;--and if the Century expects that every man shall do hisduty, surely Sterling was not the man to balk it!  Various extractsfrom these picture-surveys are given in Hare; the others, I suppose,Sterling himself subsequently destroyed, not valuing them much.Certainly no stranger could address himself more eagerly to reap whatartistic harvest Rome offers, which is reckoned the peculiar produceof Rome among cities under the sun; to all galleries, churches,sistine chapels, ruins, coliseums, and artistic or dilettante shrineshe zealously pilgrimed; and had much to say then and afterwards, andwith real technical and historical knowledge I believe, about theobjects of devotion there.  But it often struck me as a question,Whether all this even to himself was not, more or less, a nebulouskind of element; prescribed not by Nature and her verities, but by theCentury expecting every man to do his duty?  Whether not perhaps, ingood part, temporary dilettante cloudland of our poor Century;--or canit be the real diviner Pisgah height, and everlasting mount of vision,for man's soul in any Century?  And I think Sterling himself benttowards a negative conclusion, in the course of years.  Certainly, ofall subjects this was the one I cared least to hear even Sterling talkof:  indeed it is a subject on which earnest men, abhorrent ofhypocrisy and speech that has no meaning, are admonished to silence inthis sad time, and had better, in such a Babel as we have got into forthe present, "perambulate their picture-gallery with little or nospeech."Here is another and to me much more earnest kind of "Art," whichrenders Rome unique among the cities of the world; of this we will, inpreference; take a glance through Sterling's eyes:--"January 22d, 1839.--On Friday last there was a great Festival at St.Peter's; the only one I have seen.  The Church was decorated withcrimson hangings, and the choir fitted up with seats and galleries,and a throne for the Pope.  There were perhaps a couple of hundredguards of different kinds; and three or four hundred English ladies,and not so many foreign male spectators; so that the place lookedempty.  The Cardinals in scarlet, and Monsignori in purple, werethere; and a body of officiating Clergy.  The Pope was carried in inhis chair on men's shoulders, wearing the Triple Crown; which I havethus actually seen:  it is something like a gigantic Egg, and of thesame color, with three little bands of gold,--very large Egg-shellwith three streaks of the yolk smeared round it.  He was dressed inwhite silk robes, with gold trimmings."It was a fine piece of state-show; though, as there are three or foursuch Festivals yearly, of course there is none of the eager interestwhich breaks out at coronations and similar rare events; no explosionof unwonted velvets, jewels, carriages and footmen, such as London andMilan have lately enjoyed.  I guessed all the people in St. Peter's,including performers and spectators, at 2,000; where 20,000 wouldhardly have been a crushing crowd.  Mass was performed, and a stupidbut short Latin sermon delivered by a lad, in honor of St. Peter, whowould have been much astonished if he could have heard it.  Thegenuflections, and train-bearings, and folding up the tails of silkpetticoats while the Pontiff knelt, and the train of Cardinals goingup to kiss his Ring, and so forth,--made on me the impression ofsomething immeasurably old and sepulchral, such as might suit theGrand Lama's court, or the inside of an Egyptian Pyramid; or as if theHieroglyphics on one of the Obelisks here should begin to pace andgesticulate, and nod their bestial heads upon the granite tablets.The careless bystanders, the London ladies with their eye-glasses andlook of an Opera-box, the yawning young gentlemen of the _GuardaNobile_, and the laugh of one of the file of vermilion Priests roundthe steps of the altar at the whispered good thing of his neighbor,brought one back to nothing indeed of a very lofty kind, but still tothe Nineteenth Century."--"At the great Benediction of the City and the World on Easter Sundayby the Pope," he writes afterwards, "there was a large crowd bothnative and foreign, hundreds of carriages, and thousands of the lowerorders of people from the country; but even of the poor hardly one intwenty took off his hat, and a still smaller number knelt down.  A fewyears ago, not a head was covered, nor was there a knee which did notbow."--A very decadent "Holiness of our Lord the Pope," it wouldappear!--Sterling's view of the Pope, as seen in these his gala days, doing hisbig play-actorism under God's earnest sky, was much more substantialto me than his studies in the picture-galleries.  To Mr. Hare also hewrites:  "I have seen the Pope in all his pomp at St. Peter's; and helooked to me a mere lie in livery.  The Romish Controversy isdoubtless a much more difficult one than the managers of theReligious-Tract Society fancy, because it is a theoretical dispute;and in dealing with notions and authorities, I can quite understandhow a mere student in a library, with no eye for facts, should takeeither one side or other.  But how any man with clear head and honestheart, and capable of seeing realities, and distinguishing them fromscenic falsehoods, should, after living in a Romanist country, andespecially at Rome, be inclined to side with Leo against Luther, Icannot understand."[20]It is fit surely to recognize with admiring joy any glimpse of theBeautiful and the Eternal that is hung out for us, in color, in formor tone, in canvas, stone, or atmospheric air, and made accessible byany sense, in this world:  but it is greatly fitter still (little aswe are used that way) to shudder in pity and abhorrence over thescandalous tragedy, transcendent nadir of human ugliness andcontemptibility, which under the daring title of religious worship,and practical recognition of the Highest God, daily and hourlyeverywhere transacts itself there.  And, alas, not there only, butelsewhere, everywhere more or less; whereby our sense is so blunted toit;--whence, in all provinces of human life, these tears!--But let us take a glance at the Carnival, since we are here. TheLetters, as before, are addressed to Knightsbridge; the date _Rome_:--"_February 5th_, 1839.--The Carnival began yesterday.  It is a curiousexample of the trifling things which will heartily amuse tens ofthousands of grown people, precisely because they are trifling, andtherefore a relief from serious business, cares and labors.  The Corsois a street about a mile long, and about as broad as Jermyn Street;but bordered by much loftier houses, with many palaces and churches,and has two or three small squares opening into it.  Carriages, mostlyopen, drove up and down it for two or three hours; and the contentswere shot at with handfuls of comfits from the windows,--in the hopeof making them as non-content as possible,--while they returned thefire to the best of their inferior ability.  The populace, among whomwas I, walked about; perhaps one in fifty were masked in character;but there was little in the masquerade either of splendor of costumeor liveliness of mimicry.  However, the whole scene was very gay;there were a good many troops about, and some of them heavy dragoons,who flourished their swords with the magnanimity of our Life-Guards,to repel the encroachments of too ambitious little boys.  Most of thewindows and balconies were hung with colored drapery; and there wereflags, trumpets, nosegays and flirtations of all shapes and sizes.The best of all was, that there was laughter enough to have frightenedCassius out of his thin carcass, could the lean old homicide have beenpresent, otherwise than as a fleshless ghost;--in which capacity Ithought I had a glimpse of him looking over the shoulder of aparticolored clown, in a carriage full of London Cockneys drivingtowards the Capitol.  This good-humored foolery will go on for severaldays to come, ending always with the celebrated Horse-race, of horseswithout riders.  The long street is cleared in the centre by troops,and half a dozen quadrupeds, ornamented like Grimaldi in a Londonpantomime, scamper away, with the mob closing and roaring at theirheels.""_February_ 9th, 1839.--The usual state of Rome is quiet and sober.One could almost fancy the actual generation held their breath, andstole by on tiptoe, in presence of so memorable a past.  But duringthe Carnival all mankind, womankind and childkind think it unbecomingnot to play the fool.  The modern donkey pokes its head out of thelion's skin of old Rome, and brays out the absurdest of asinineroundelays.  Conceive twenty thousand grown people in a long street,at the windows, on the footways, and in carriages, amused day afterday for several hours in pelting and being pelted with handfuls ofmock or real sugar-plums; and this no name or presence, but realdownright showers of plaster comfits, from which people guard theireyes with meshes of wire.  As sure as a carriage passes under a windowor balcony where are acquaintances of theirs, down comes a shower ofhail, ineffectually returned from below.  The parties in two crossingcarriages similarly assault each other; and there are long balconieshung the whole way with a deep canvas pocket full of this mortal shot.One Russian Grand Duke goes with a troop of youngsters in a wagon, alldressed in brown linen frocks and masked, and pelts among the mostfurious, also being pelted.  The children are of course preeminentlyvigorous, and there is a considerable circulation of real sugar-plums,which supply consolation for all disappointments."The whole to conclude, as is proper, with a display, with twodisplays, of fireworks; in which art, as in some others, Rome isunrivalled:--"_February 9th_, 1839.--It seems to be the ambition of all the lowerclasses to wear a mask and showy grotesque disguise of some kind; andI believe many of the upper ranks do the same.  They even put St.Peter's into masquerade; and make it a Cathedral of Lamplight insteadof a stone one.  Two evenings ago this feat was performed; and I wasable to see it from the rooms of a friend near this, which command anexcellent view of it.  I never saw so beautiful an effect ofartificial light.  The evening was perfectly serene and clear; theprincipal lines of the building, the columns, architrave and pedimentof the front, the two inferior cupolas, the curves of the dome fromwhich the dome rises, the ribs of the dome itself, the small orielwindows between them, and the lantern and ball and cross,--all weredelineated in the clear vault of air by lines of pale yellow fire.The dome of another great Church, much nearer to the eye, stood up asa great black mass,--a funereal contrast to the luminous tabernacle."While I was looking at this latter, a red blaze burst from thesummit, and at the same moment seemed to flash over the wholebuilding, filling up the pale outline with a simultaneous burst offire.  This is a celebrated display; and is done, I believe, by theemployment of a very great number of men to light, at the sameinstant, the torches which are fixed for the purpose all over thebuilding.  After the first glare of fire, I did not think the secondaspect of the building so beautiful as the first; it wanted bothsoftness and distinctness.  The two most animated days of the Carnivalare still to come.""_April 4th_, 1839.--We have just come to the termination of all theEaster spectacles here.  On Sunday evening St. Peter's was a secondtime illuminated; I was in the Piazza, and admired the sight from anearer point than when I had seen it before at the time of theCarnival."On Monday evening the celebrated fire-works were let off from theCastle of St. Angelo; they were said to be, in some respects morebrilliant than usual.  I certainly never saw any fireworks comparableto them for beauty.  The Girandola is a discharge of many thousands ofrockets at once, which of course fall back, like the leaves of a lily,and form for a minute a very beautiful picture.  There was also insilvery light a very long Facade of a Palace, which looked a residencefor Oberon and Titania, and beat Aladdin's into darkness.  Afterwardsa series of cascades of red fire poured down the faces of the Castleand of the scaffoldings round it, and seemed a burning Niagara.  Ofcourse there were abundance of serpents, wheels and cannon-shot; therewas also a display of dazzling white light, which made a strangeappearance on the houses, the river, the bridge, and the faces of themultitude.  The whole ended with a second and a more splendidGirandola."Take finally, to people the scene a little for us, if our imaginationbe at all lively, these three small entries, of different dates, andso wind up:--"_December 30th_, 1838.--I received on Christmas-day a packet from Dr.Carlyle, containing Letters from the Maurices; which were a verypleasant arrival.  The Dr. wrote a few lines with them, mentioningthat he was only at Civita Vecchia while the steamer baited on its wayto Naples.  I have written to thank him for his despatches.""_March 16th_, 1839.--I have seen a good deal of John Mill, whosesociety I like much.  He enters heartily into the interest of thethings which I most care for here, and I have seldom had more pleasurethan in taking him to see Raffael's Loggie, where are the Frescoscalled his Bible, and to the Sixtine Chapel, which I admire and lovemore and more.  He is in very weak health, but as fresh and clear inmind as possible....  English politics seem in a queer state, theConservatives creeping on, the Whigs losing ground; like combatants onthe top of a breach, while there is a social mine below which willprobably blow both parties into the air.""_April 4th_, 1839.--I walked out on Tuesday on the Ancona Road, andabout noon met a travelling carriage, which from a distance lookedvery suspicious, and on nearer approach was found really to containCaptain Sterling and an Albanian manservant on the front, and behindunder the hood Mrs. A. Sterling and the she portion of the tail.  Theyseemed very well; and, having turned the Albanian back to the rear ofthe whole machine, I sat by Anthony, and entered Rome intriumph."--Here is indeed a conquest!  Captain A. Sterling, now on hisreturn from service in Corfu, meets his Brother in this manner; andthe remaining Roman days are of a brighter complexion.  As thesesuddenly ended, I believe he turned southward, and found at Naples theDr. Carlyle above mentioned (an extremely intimate acquaintance ofmine), who was still there.  For we are a most travelling people, weof this Island in this time; and, as the Prophet threatened, seeourselves, in so many senses, made "like unto a wheel!"--Sterling returned from Italy filled with much cheerful imagery andreminiscence, and great store of artistic, serious, dilettante andother speculation for the time; improved in health, too; but probablylittle enriched in real culture or spiritual strength; and indeed notpermanently altered by his tour in any respect to a sensible extent,that one could notice.  He returned rather in haste, and before theexpected time; summoned, about the middle of April, by his Wife'sdomestic situation at Hastings; who, poor lady, had been brought tobed before her calculation, and had in few days lost her infant; andnow saw a household round her much needing the master's presence.  Hehurried off to Malta, dreading the Alps at that season; and came home,by steamer, with all speed, early in May, 1839.PART III.CHAPTER I.CLIFTON.Matters once readjusted at Hastings, it was thought Sterling's healthhad so improved, and his activities towards Literature so developedthemselves into congruity, that a permanent English place of abodemight now again be selected,--on the Southwest coast somewhere,--andthe family once more have the blessing of a home, and see its _lares_and _penates_ and household furniture unlocked from the Pantechniconrepositories, where they had so long been lying.Clifton, by Bristol, with its soft Southern winds and high cheerfulsituation, recommended too by the presence of one or more valuableacquaintances there, was found to be the eligible place; and thitherin this summer of 1839, having found a tolerable lodging, with theprospect by and by of an agreeable house, he and his removed.  Thiswas the end of what I call his "third peregrinity;"--or reckoning theWest Indies one, his fourth.  This also is, since Bayswater, thefourth time his family has had to shift on his account.  Bayswater;then to Bordeaux, to Blackheath and Knightsbridge (during the Madeiratime), to Hastings (Roman time); and now to Clifton, not to stay thereeither:  a sadly nomadic life to be prescribed to a civilized man!At Clifton his habitation was speedily enough set up; householdconveniences, methods of work, daily promenades on foot or horseback,and before long even a circle of friends, or of kindly neighborhoodsripening into intimacy, were established round him.  In all this noman could be more expert or expeditious, in such cases.  It was withsingular facility, in a loving, hoping manner, that he threw himselfopen to the new interests and capabilities of the new place; snatchedout of it whatsoever of human or material would suit him; and inbrief, in all senses had pitched his tent-habitation, and grew to lookon it as a house.  It was beautiful too, as well as pathetic.  Thisman saw himself reduced to be a dweller in tents, his house is but astone tent; and he can so kindly accommodate himself to thatarrangement;--healthy faculty and diseased necessity, nature andhabit, and all manner of things primary and secondary, original andincidental, conspiring now to make it easy for him.  With the evils ofnomadism, he participated to the full in whatever benefits lie in itfor a man.He had friends enough, old and new, at Clifton, whose intercourse madethe place human for him.  Perhaps among the most valued of the formersort may be mentioned Mrs. Edward Strachey, Widow of the late IndianJudge, who now resided here; a cultivated, graceful, most devout andhigh-minded lady; whom he had known in old years, first probably asCharles Buller's Aunt, and whose esteem was constant for him, andalways precious to him.  She was some ten or twelve years older thanhe; she survived him some years, but is now also gone from us.  Of newfriends acquired here, besides a skilful and ingenious Dr. Symonds,physician as well as friend, the principal was Francis Newman, thenand still an ardently inquiring soul, of fine University and otherattainments, of sharp-cutting, restlessly advancing intellect, and themildest pious enthusiasm; whose worth, since better known to all theworld, Sterling highly estimated;--and indeed practically testifiedthe same; having by will appointed him, some years hence, guardian tohis eldest Son; which pious function Mr. Newman now successfullydischarges.Sterling was not long in certainty as to his abode at Clifton:  alas,where could he long be so?  Hardly six months were gone when his oldenemy again overtook him; again admonished him how frail his hopes ofpermanency were.  Each winter, it turned out, he had to fly; and afterthe second of these, he quitted the place altogether.  Here,meanwhile, in a Letter to myself, and in Excerpts from others, aresome glimpses of his advent and first summer there:--                           _To his Mother_."_Clifton, June 11th_, 1839.--As yet I am personally veryuncomfortable from the general confusion of this house, which deprivesme of my room to sit and read and write in; all being more or lesslumbered by boxes, and invaded by servile domesticities aproned,handled, bristled, and of nondescript varieties.  We have very finewarm weather, with occasional showers; and the verdure of the woodsand fields is very beautiful.  Bristol seems as busy as need be; andthe shops and all kinds of practical conveniences are excellent; butthose of Clifton have the usual sentimental, not to say meretriciousfraudulence of commercial establishments in Watering-places."The bag which Hannah forgot reached us safely at Bath on Fridaymorning; but I cannot quite unriddle the mystery of the change ofpadlocks, for I left the right one in care of the Head Steam-engine atPaddington, which seemed a very decent person with a good black coaton, and a pen behind its ear.  I have been meditating much on thestory of Palarea's 'box of papers;' which does not appear to be in mypossession, and I have a strong impression that I gave it to youngFlorez Calderon.  I will write to say so to Madam Torrijos speedily."Palarea, Dr. Palarea, I understand, was "an old guerilla leader whomthey called _El Medico_."  Of him and of the vanished shadows, nowgone to Paris, to Madrid, or out of the world, let us say nothing!                           _To Mr. Carlyle_."_June 15th_, 1839.--We have a room now occupied by Robert Barton [abrother-in-law]; to which Anthony may perhaps succeed; but which afterhim, or in lieu of him, would expand itself to receive you.  Is thereno hope of your coming?  I would undertake to ride with you at allpossible paces, and in all existing directions."As yet my books are lying as ghost books, in a limbo on the banks ofa certain Bristolian Styx, humanly speaking, a _Canal_; but the otherapparatus of life is gathered about me, and performs its diurnalfunctions.  The place pleases me better than I expected:  a farlookout on all sides, over green country; a sufficient old City lyingin the hollow near; and civilization, in no tumultuous state, ratherindeed stagnant, visible in the Rows of Houses and Gardens which callthemselves Clifton.  I hope soon to take a lease of a house, where Imay arrange myself more methodically; keep myself equably boiling inmy own kitchen; and spread myself over a series of book-shelves....  Ihave just been interrupted by a visit from Mrs. Strachey; with whom Idined yesterday.  She seems a very good and thoroughly kind-heartedwoman; and it is pleasant to have her for a neighbor....  I have readEmerson's Pamphlets.  I should find it more difficult than ever towrite to him."                           _To his Father_."_June 30th_, 1839.--Of Books I shall have no lack, though noplethora; and the Reading-room supplies all one can want in the way ofPapers and Reviews.  I go there three or four times a week, andinquire how the human race goes on.  I suppose this Turco-Egyptian Warwill throw several diplomatists into a state of great excitement, andmassacre a good many thousands of Africans and Asiatics?--For thepresent, it appears, the English Education Question is settled.  Iwish the Government had said that, in their inspection andsuperintendence, they would look only to secular matters, and leavereligious ones to the persons who set up the schools, whoever thesemight be.  It seems to me monstrous that the State should be preventedtaking any efficient measures for teaching Roman Catholic children toread, write and cipher, merely because they believe in the Pope, andthe Pope is an impostor,--which I candidly confess he is!  There is noquestion which I can so ill endure to see made a party one as that ofEducation."--The following is of the same day:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                                 "MANOR HOUSE, CLIFTON PLACE, CLIFTON,                                                     "30th June, 1839."MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I have heard, this morning, from my Father, thatyou are to set out on Tuesday for Scotland:  so I have determined tofillip away some spurt of ink in your direction, which may reach youbefore you move towards Thule."Writing to you, in fact, is considerably easier than writing aboutyou; which has been my employment of late, at leisure moments,--thatis, moments of leisure from idleness, not work.  As you partlyguessed, I took in hand a Review of _Teufelsdrockh_--for want of abetter Heuschrecke to do the work; and when I have been well enough,and alert enough, during the last fortnight, have tried to set downsome notions about Tobacco, Radicalism, Christianity, Assafoetida andso forth.  But a few abortive pages are all the result as yet.  If myspeculations should ever see daylight, they may chance to get you intoscrapes, but will certainly get me into worse....  But one must work;_sic itur ad astra_,--and the _astra_ are always there to befriendone, at least as asterisks, filling up the gaps which yawn in vain forwords."Except my unsuccessful efforts to discuss you and your offences, Ihave done nothing that leaves a trace behind;--unless the endeavor toteach my little boy the Latin declensions shall be found, at some timeshort of the Last Day, to have done so.  I have--rather I think fromdyspepsia than dyspneumony--been often and for days disabled fromdoing anything but read.  In this way I have gone through a good dealof Strauss's Book; which is exceedingly clever and clearheaded; withmore of insight, and less of destructive rage than I expected.  Itwill work deep and far, in such a time as ours.  When so many mindsare distracted about the history, or rather genesis of the Gospel, itis a great thing for partisans on the one side to have, what the othernever have wanted, a Book of which they can say, This is our Creed andCode,--or rather Anti-creed and Anti-code.  And Strauss seemsperfectly secure against the sort of answer to which Voltaire'scritical and historical shallowness perpetually exposed him.  I meanto read the Book through.  It seems admitted that the orthodoxtheologians have failed to give any sufficient answer.--I have alsolooked through Michelet's _Luther_, with great delight; and have readthe fourth volume of Coleridge's _Literary Remains_, in which thereare things that would interest you.  He has a great hankering afterCromwell, and explicitly defends the execution of Charles."Of Mrs. Strachey we have seen a great deal; and might have seen more,had I had time and spirits for it.  She is a warm-hearted,enthusiastic creature, whom one cannot but like.  She seems alwaysexcited by the wish for more excitement than her life affords.  Andsuch a person is always in danger of doing something less wise thanhis best knowledge and aspirations; because he must do something, andcircumstances do not allow him to do what he desires.  Thence, afterthe first glow of novelty, endless self-tormenting comes from thecontrast between aims and acts.  She sets out, with her daughter andtwo boys, for a Tour in Wales to-morrow morning.  Her talk of you isalways most affectionate; and few, I guess, will read _Sartor_ withmore interest than she."I am still in a very extempore condition as to house, books, &c.  Onewhich I have hired for three years will be given up to me in themiddle of August; and then I may hope to have something like ahouse,--so far as that is possible for any one to whom Time itself isoften but a worse or a better kind of cave in the desert.  We have hadrainy and cheerless weather almost since the day of our arrival.  Butthe sun now shines more lovingly, and the skies seem less disdainfulof man and his perplexities.  The earth is green, abundant andbeautiful.  But human life, so far as I can learn, is mean and meagreenough in its purposes, however striking to the speculative orsentimental bystander.  Pray be assured that whatever you may say ofthe 'landlord at Clifton,'[21] the more I know of him, the less I shalllike him.  Well with me if I can put up with him for the present, andmake use of him, till at last I can joyfully turn him off forever!"Love to you Wife and self.  My little Charlotte desires me to tellyou that she has new shoes for her Doll, which she will show you whenyou come.                                "Yours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."The visit to Clifton never took effect; nor to any of Sterling'ssubsequent homes; which now is matter of regret to me.  Concerning the"Review of _Teufelsdrockh_" there will be more to say anon.  As to"little Charlotte and her Doll," I remember well enough and was morethan once reminded, this bright little creature, on one of my firstvisits to Bayswater, had earnestly applied to me to put her Doll'sshoes on for her; which feat was performed.--The next fragmentindicates a household settled, fallen into wholesome routine again;and may close the series here:--                           _To his Mother_."_July 22d_, 1839.--A few evenings ago we went to Mr. Griffin's, andmet there Dr. Prichard, the author of a well-known Book on the _Racesof Mankind_, to which it stands in the same relation among Englishbooks as the Racing Calendar does to those of Horsekind.  He is a veryintelligent, accomplished person.  We had also there the Dean; acertain Dr. ---- of Corpus College, Cambridge (a booby); and a cleverfellow, a Mr. Fisher, one of the Tutors of Trinity in my days.  We hada very pleasant evening."--At London we were in the habit of expecting Sterling pretty often; hispresence, in this house as in others, was looked for, once in themonth or two, and came always as sunshine in the gray weather to meand mine.  My daily walks with him had long since been cut shortwithout renewal; that walk to Eltham and Edgeworth's perhaps the lastof the kind he and I had:  but our intimacy, deepening and wideningyear after year, knew no interruption or abatement of increase; anhonest, frank and truly human mutual relation, valuable or eveninvaluable to both parties, and a lasting loss, hardly to be replacedin this world, to the survivor of the two.His visits, which were usually of two or three days, were always fullof business, rapid in movement as all his life was.  To me, ifpossible, he would come in the evening; a whole cornucopia of talk andspeculation was to be discharged.  If the evening would not do, and myaffairs otherwise permitted, I had to mount into cabs with him; flyfar and wide, shuttling athwart the big Babel, wherever his calls andpauses had to be.  This was his way to husband time!  Our talk, insuch straitened circumstances, was loud or low as the circumambientgroaning rage of wheels and sound prescribed,--very loud it had to bein such thoroughfares as London Bridge and Cheapside; but except whilehe was absent, off for minutes into some banker's office, lawyer's,stationer's, haberdasher's or what office there might be, it neverpaused.  In this way extensive strange dialogues were carried on:  tome also very strange,--private friendly colloquies, on all manner ofrich subjects, held thus amid the chaotic roar of things.  Sterlingwas full of speculations, observations and bright sallies; vividlyawake to what was passing in the world; glanced pertinently withvictorious clearness, without spleen, though often enough with a dashof mockery, into its Puseyisms, Liberalisms, literary Lionisms, orwhat else the mad hour might be producing,--always prompt to recognizewhat grain of sanity might be in the same.  He was opulent in talk,and the rapid movement and vicissitude on such occasions seemed togive him new excitement.Once, I still remember,--it was some years before, probably in May, onhis return from Madeira,--he undertook a day's riding with me; onceand never again.  We coursed extensively, over the Hampstead andHighgate regions, and the country beyond, sauntering or gallopingthrough many leafy lanes and pleasant places, in ever-flowing,ever-changing talk; and returned down Regent Street at nightfall:  oneof the cheerfulest days I ever had;--not to be repeated, said theFates.  Sterling was charming on such occasions:  at once a child anda gifted man.  A serious fund of thought he always had, a seriousdrift you never missed in him:  nor indeed had he much depth of reallaughter or sense of the ludicrous, as I have elsewhere said; but whathe had was genuine, free and continual:  his sparkling sallies bubbledup as from aerated natural fountains; a mild dash of gayety was nativeto the man, and had moulded his physiognomy in a very graceful way.We got once into a cab, about Charing Cross; I know not now whence orwell whitherward, nor that our haste was at all special; however, thecabman, sensible that his pace was slowish, took to whipping, with asteady, passionless, businesslike assiduity which, though the horseseemed lazy rather than weak, became afflictive; and I urgedremonstrance with the savage fellow:  "Let him alone," answeredSterling; "he is kindling the enthusiasm of his horse, you perceive;that is the first thing, then we shall do very well!"--as accordinglywe did.At Clifton, though his thoughts began to turn more on poetic forms ofcomposition, he was diligent in prose elaborations too,--doingCriticism, for one thing, as we incidentally observed.  He wrotethere, and sent forth in this autumn of 1839, his most importantcontribution to John Mill's Review, the article on _Carlyle_, whichstands also in Mr. Hare's collection.[22]  What its effect on thepublic was I knew not, and know not; but remember well, and may herebe permitted to acknowledge, the deep silent joy, not of a weak orignoble nature, which it gave to myself in my then mood and situation;as it well might.  The first generous human recognition, expressedwith heroic emphasis, and clear conviction visible amid its fieryexaggeration, that one's poor battle in this world is not quite a madand futile, that it is perhaps a worthy and manful one, which willcome to something yet:  this fact is a memorable one in every history;and for me Sterling, often enough the stiff gainsayer in our privatecommunings, was the doer of this.  The thought burnt in me like alamp, for several days; lighting up into a kind of heroic splendor thesad volcanic wrecks, abysses, and convulsions of said poor battle, andsecretly I was very grateful to my daring friend, and am still, andought to be.  What the public might be thinking about him and hisaudacities, and me in consequence, or whether it thought at all, Inever learned, or much heeded to learn.Sterling's gainsaying had given way on many points; but on others itcontinued stiff as ever, as may be seen in that article; indeed hefought Parthian-like in such cases, holding out his last position asdoggedly as the first:  and to some of my notions he seemed to grow instubbornness of opposition, with the growing inevitability, and neverwould surrender.  Especially that doctrine of the "greatness andfruitfulness of Silence," remained afflictive and incomprehensible:"Silence?" he would say:  "Yes, truly; if they give you leave toproclaim silence by cannon-salvos!  My Harpocrates-Stentor!"  In likemanner, "Intellect and Virtue," how they are proportional, or areindeed one gift in us, the same great summary of gifts; and again,"Might and Right," the identity of these two, if a man will understandthis God's-Universe, and that only he who conforms to the law of itcan in the long-run have any "might:"  all this, at the first blush,often awakened Sterling's musketry upon me, and many volleys I havehad to stand,--the thing not being decidable by that kind of weapon orstrategy.In such cases your one method was to leave our friend in peace.  Bysmall-arms practice no mortal could dislodge him:  but if you were inthe right, the silent hours would work continually for you; andSterling, more certainly than any man, would and must at length swearfealty to the right, and passionately adopt it, burying allhostilities under foot.  A more candid soul, once let the stormfulvelocities of it expend themselves, was nowhere to be met with.  A sonof light, if I have ever seen one; recognizing the truth, if truththere were; hurling overboard his vanities, petulances, big and smallinterests, in ready loyalty to truth:  very beautiful; at once a loyalchild, as I said, and a gifted man!--Here is a very pertinent passagefrom one of his Letters, which, though the name continues blank, Iwill insert:--                           _To his Father_."_October 15th_, 1839.--As to my 'over-estimate of ----,' yourexpressions rather puzzle me.  I suppose there may be, at the outside,a hundred persons in England whose opinions on such a matter are worthas much as mine.  If by 'the public' you and my Mother mean the otherninety-nine, I submit.  I have no doubt that, on any matter notrelating peculiarly to myself, the judgment of the ninety-nine mostphilosophical heads in the country, if unanimous, would be right, andmine, if opposed to them, wrong.  But then I am at a loss to make out,How the decision of the very few really competent persons has beenascertained to be thus in contradiction to me?  And on the other hand,I conceive myself, from my opportunities, knowledge and attention tothe subject, to be alone quite entitled to outvote tens of thousandsof gentlemen, however much my superiors as men of business, men of theworld, or men of merely dry or merely frivolous literature."I do not remember ever before to have heard the saying, whether ofTalleyrand or of any one else, That _all_ the world is a wiser manthan any man in the world.  Had it been said even by the Devil, itwould nevertheless be false.  I have often indeed heard the saying,_On peut etre plus FIN qu'un autre, mais pas plus FIN que tous lesautres_.  But observe that '_fin_' means _cunning_, not _wise_.  Thedifference between this assertion and the one you refer to is curiousand worth examining.  It is quite certain, there is always some oneman in the world wiser than all the rest; as Socrates was declared bythe oracle to be; and as, I suppose, Bacon was in his day, and perhapsBurke in his.  There is also some one, whose opinion would be probablytrue, if opposed to that of all around him; and it is alwaysindubitable that the wise men are the scores, and the unwise themillions.  The millions indeed come round, in the course of ageneration or two, to the opinions of the wise; but by that time a newrace of wise men have again shot ahead of their contemporaries:  so ithas always been, and so, in the nature of things, it always must be.But with cunning, the matter is quite different.  Cunning is not_dishonest wisdom_, which would be a contradiction in terms; it is_dishonest prudence_, acuteness in practice, not in thought:  andthough there must always be some one the most cunning in the world, aswell as some one the most wise, these two superlatives will fare verydifferently in the world.  In the case of cunning, the shrewdness of awhole people, of a whole generation, may doubtless be combined againstthat of the one, and so triumph over it; which was pretty much thecase with Napoleon.  But although a man of the greatest cunning canhardly conceal his designs and true character from millions ofunfriendly eyes, it is quite impossible thus to club the eyes of themind, and to constitute by the union of ten thousand follies anequivalent for a single wisdom.  A hundred school-boys can easilyunite and thrash their one master; but a hundred thousand school-boyswould not be nearer than a score to knowing as much Greek among themas Bentley or Scaliger.  To all which, I believe, you will assent asreadily as I;--and I have written it down only because I have nothingmore important to say."--Besides his prose labors, Sterling had by this time written,publishing chiefly in _Blackwood_, a large assortment of verses,_Sexton's Daughter_, _Hymns of a Hermit_, and I know not what otherextensive stock of pieces; concerning which he was now somewhat at aloss as to his true course.  He could write verses with astonishingfacility, in any given form of metre; and to various readers theyseemed excellent, and high judges had freely called them so, but hehimself had grave misgivings on that latter essential point.  In facthere once more was a parting of the ways, "Write in Poetry; write inProse?" upon which, before all else, it much concerned him to come toa settlement.My own advice was, as it had always been, steady against Poetry; andwe had colloquies upon it, which must have tried his patience, for inhim there was a strong leaning the other way.  But, as I remarked andurged:  Had he not already gained superior excellence in delivering,by way of _speech_ or prose, what thoughts were in him, which is thegrand and only intrinsic function of a writing man, call him by whattitle you will?  Cultivate that superior excellence till it become aperfect and superlative one.  Why _sing_ your bits of thoughts, if you_can_ contrive to speak them?  By your thought, not by your mode ofdelivering it, you must live or die.--Besides I had to observe therewas in Sterling intrinsically no depth of _tune_; which surely is thereal test of a Poet or Singer, as distinguished from a Speaker?  Inmusic proper he had not the slightest ear; all music was mereimpertinent noise to him, nothing in it perceptible but the mere marchor time.  Nor in his way of conception and utterance, in the verses hewrote, was there any contradiction, but a constant confirmation to me,of that fatal prognostic;--as indeed the whole man, in ear and heartand tongue, is one; and he whose soul does not sing, need not try todo it with his throat.  Sterling's verses had a monotonous rub-a-dub,instead of tune; no trace of music deeper than that of a well-beatendrum; to which limited range of excellence the substance alsocorresponded; being intrinsically always a rhymed and slightlyrhythmical _speech_, not a _song_.In short, all seemed to me to say, in his case:  "You can speak withsupreme excellence; sing with considerable excellence you never can.And the Age itself, does it not, beyond most ages, demand and requireclear speech; an Age incapable of being sung to, in any but a trivialmanner, till these convulsive agonies and wild revolutionaryoverturnings readjust themselves?  Intelligible word of command, notmusical psalmody and fiddling, is possible in this fell storm ofbattle.  Beyond all ages, our Age admonishes whatsoever thinking orwriting man it has:  Oh, speak to me some wise intelligible speech;your wise meaning in the shortest and clearest way; behold I am dyingfor want of wise meaning, and insight into the devouring fact:  speak,if you have any wisdom!  As to song so called, and your fiddlingtalent,--even if you have one, much more if you have none,--we willtalk of that a couple of centuries hence, when things are calmeragain.  Homer shall be thrice welcome; but only when Troy is _taken_:alas, while the siege lasts, and battle's fury rages everywhere, whatcan I do with the Homer?  I want Achilleus and Odysseus, and amenraged to see them trying to be Homers!"--Sterling, who respected my sincerity, and always was amenable enoughto counsel, was doubtless much confused by such contradictorydiagnosis of his case.  The question, Poetry or Prose?  became moreand more pressing, more and more insoluble.  He decided, at last, toappeal to the public upon it;--got ready, in the late autumn, a smallselect Volume of his verses; and was now busy pushing it through thepress.  Unfortunately, in the mean while, a grave illness, of the oldpulmonary sort, overtook him, which at one time threatened to bedangerous.  This is a glance again into his interior household inthese circumstances:--                           _To his Mother_."_December 21st_, 1839.--The Tin box came quite safe, with all itsmiscellaneous contents.  I suppose we are to thank you for the _ComicAlmanac_, which, as usual, is very amusing; and for the Book on_Watt_, which disappointed me.  The scientific part is no doubt verygood, and particularly clear and simple; but there is nothingremarkable in the account of Watt's character; and it is an absurdpiece of French impertinence in Arago to say, that England has not yetlearnt to appreciate men like Watt, because he was not made a peer;which, were our peerage an institution like that of France, would havebeen very proper."I have now finished correcting the proofs of my little Volume ofPoems.  It has been a great plague to me, and one that I would nothave incurred, had I expected to be laid up as I have been; but thematter was begun before I had any notion of being disabled by such anillness,--the severest I have suffered since I went to the WestIndies.  The Book will, after all, be a botched business in manyrespects; and I much doubt whether it will pay its expenses:  but Itry to consider it as out of my hands, and not to fret myself aboutit.  I shall be very curious to see Carlyle's Tractate on _Chartism_;which"--But we need not enter upon that.Sterling's little Book was printed at his own expense;[23] published byMoxon in the very end of this year.  It carries an appropriate andpretty Epigraph:--     "Feeling, Thought, and Fancy be     Gentle sister Graces three:     If these prove averse to me,     They will punish,--pardon Ye!"He had dedicated the little Volume to Mr. Hare;--and he submitted verypatiently to the discouraging neglect with which it was received bythe world; for indeed the "Ye" said nothing audible, in the way ofpardon or other doom; so that whether the "sister Graces" were averseor not, remained as doubtful as ever.CHAPTER II.TWO WINTERS.As we said above, it had been hoped by Sterling's friends, not veryconfidently by himself, that in the gentler air of Clifton his healthmight so far recover as to enable him to dispense with autumnalvoyages, and to spend the year all round in a house of his own.  Thesehopes, favorable while the warm season lasted, broke down when wintercame.  In November of this same year, while his little Volume waspassing through the press, bad and worse symptoms, spitting of bloodto crown the sad list, reappeared; and Sterling had to equip himselfagain, at this late season, for a new flight to Madeira; wherein thegood Calvert, himself suffering, and ready on all grounds for such anadventure, offered to accompany him.  Sterling went by land toFalmouth, meaning there to wait for Calvert, who was to come by theMadeira Packet, and there take him on board.Calvert and the Packet did arrive, in stormy January weather; whichcontinued wildly blowing for weeks; forbidding all egress Westward,especially for invalids.  These elemental tumults, and blustering warsof sea and sky, with nothing but the misty solitude of Madeira in thedistance, formed a very discouraging outlook.  In the mean whileFalmouth itself had offered so many resources, and seemed so tolerablein climate and otherwise, while this wintry ocean looked soinhospitable for invalids, it was resolved our voyagers should staywhere they were till spring returned.  Which accordingly was done;with good effect for that season, and also with results for the comingseasons.  Here again, from Letters to Knightsbridge, are some glimpsesof his winter-life:--"_Falmouth, February 5th_, 1840.--I have been to-day to see a newtin-mine, two or three miles off, which is expected to turn into acopper-mine by and by, so they will have the two constituents ofbronze close together.  This, by the way, was the 'brass' of Homer andthe Ancients generally, who do not seem to have known our brass madeof copper and zinc.  Achilles in his armor must have looked like abronze statue.--I took Sheridan's advice, and did not go down themine.""_February 15th_.--To some iron-works the other day; where I saw halfthe beam of a great steam-engine, a piece of iron forty feet long andseven broad, cast in about five minutes.  It was a very strikingspectacle.  I hope to go to Penzance before I leave this country, andwill not fail to tell you about it."  He did make trial of Penzance,among other places, next year; but only of Falmouth this."_February 20th_.--I am going on _asy_ here, in spite of a greatchange of weather.  The East-winds are come at last, bringing withthem snow, which has been driving about for the last twenty-fourhours; not falling heavily, nor lying long when fallen.  Neither is itas yet very cold, but I suppose there will be some six weeks ofunpleasant temperature.  The marine climate of this part of Englandwill, no doubt, modify and mollify the air into a happier sort ofsubstance than that you breathe in London."The large vessels that had been lying here for weeks, waiting for awind, have now sailed; two of them for the East Indies, and havingthree hundred soldiers on board.  It is a curious thing that thelong-continued westerly winds had so prevented the coasters arriving,that the Town was almost on the point of a famine as to bread.  Thechange has brought in abundance of flour.--The people in general seemextremely comfortable; their houses are excellent, almost all ofstone.  Their habits are very little agricultural, but mining andfishing seem to prosper with them.  There are hardly any gentry here;I have not seen more than two gentlemen's carriages in the Town;indeed I think the nearest one comes from five miles off...."I have been obliged to try to occupy myself with Natural Science, inorder to give some interest to my walks; and have begun to feel my wayin Geology.  I have now learnt to recognize three or four of thecommon kinds of stone about here, when I see them; but I find itstupid work compared with Poetry and Philosophy.  In the mornings,however, for an hour or so before I get up, I generally light mycandle, and try to write some verses; and since I have been here, Ihave put together short poems, almost enough for another small volume.In the evenings I have gone on translating some of Goethe.  But six orseven hours spent on my legs, in the open air, do not leave my brainmuch energy for thinking.  Thus my life is a dull and unprofitableone, but still better than it would have been in Madeira or on boardship.  I hear from Susan every day, and write to her by return ofpost."At Falmouth Sterling had been warmly welcomed by the well-known Quakerfamily of the Foxes, principal people in that place, persons ofcultivated opulent habits, and joining to the fine purities andpieties of their sect a reverence for human intelligence in all kinds;to whom such a visitor as Sterling was naturally a welcome windfall.The family had grave elders, bright cheery younger branches, men andwomen; truly amiable all, after their sort:  they made a pleasantimage of home for Sterling in his winter exile.  "Most worthy,respectable and highly cultivated people, with a great deal of moneyamong them," writes Sterling in the end of February; "who make theplace pleasant to me.  They are connected with all the large Quakercircle, the Gurneys, Frys, &c., and also with Buxton the Abolitionist.It is droll to hear them talking of all the common topics of science,literature, and life, and in the midst of it:  'Does thou knowWordsworth?' or, 'Did thou see the Coronation?' or 'Will thou takesome refreshment?'  They are very kind and pleasant people to know.""Calvert," continues our Diarist, "is better than he lately was,though he has not been at all laid up.  He shoots little birds, anddissects and stuffs them; while I carry a hammer, and break flints andslates, to look for diamonds and rubies inside; and admire my successin the evening, when I empty my great-coat pocket of its specimens.On the whole, I doubt whether my physical proceedings will set theThames on fire.  Give my love to Anthony's Charlotte; also remember meaffectionately to the Carlyles."--At this time, too, John Mill, probably encouraged by Sterling, arrivedin Falmouth, seeking refuge of climate for a sickly younger Brother,to whom also, while he continued there, and to his poor patient, thedoors and hearts of this kind family were thrown wide open.  Falmouth,during these winter weeks, especially while Mill continued, was anunexpectedly engaging place to Sterling; and he left it in spring, forClifton, with a very kindly image of it in his thoughts.  So ended,better than it might have done, his first year's flight from theClifton winter.In April, 1840, he was at his own hearth again; cheerily pursuing hisold labors,--struggling to redeem, as he did with a gallant constancy,the available months and days, out of the wreck of so many that wereunavailable, for the business allotted him in this world.  His swift,decisive energy of character; the valiant rally he made again and everagain, starting up fresh from amid the wounded, and cheerily stormingin anew, was admirable, and showed a noble fund of natural health amidsuch an element of disease.  Somehow one could never rightly fancythat he was diseased; that those fatal ever-recurring downbreaks werenot almost rather the penalties paid for exuberance of health, and offaculty for living and working; criminal forfeitures, incurred byexcess of self-exertion and such irrepressible over-rapidity ofmovement:  and the vague hope was habitual with us, that increase ofyears, as it deadened this over-energy, would first make the mansecure of life, and a sober prosperous worker among his fellows.  Itwas always as if with a kind of blame that one heard of his being illagain!  Poor Sterling;--no man knows another's burden:  these thingswere not, and were not to be, in the way we had fancied them!Summer went along in its usual quiet tenor at Clifton; health good, asusual while the warm weather lasted, and activity abundant; the sceneas still as the busiest could wish.  "You metropolitan signors,"writes Sterling to his Father, "cannot conceive the dulness andscantiness of our provincial chronicle."  Here is a little excursionto the seaside; the lady of the family being again,--for goodreasons,--in a weakly state:--          "_To Edward Sterling, Esq., Knightsbridge, London_.                                 "PORTSHEAD, BRISTOL, 1st Sept., 1840."MY DEAR FATHER,--This place is a southern headland at the mouth ofthe Avon.  Susan, and the Children too, were all suffering fromlanguor; and as she is quite unfit to travel in a carriage, we wereobliged to move, if at all, to some place accessible by water; andthis is the nearest where we could get the fresher air of the BristolChannel.  We sent to take a house, for a week; and came down here in asteamer yesterday morning.  It seems likely to do every one good.  Wehave a comfortable house, with eight rather small bedrooms, for whichwe pay four guineas and a half for the week.  We have brought three ofour own maids, and leave one to take care of the house at Clifton."A week ago my horse fell with me, but did not hurt seriously eitherhimself or me:  it was, however, rather hard that, as there were sixlegs to be damaged, the one that did scratch itself should belong tothe part of the machine possessing only two, instead of thequadrupedal portion.  I grazed about the size of a halfpenny on myleft knee; and for a couple of days walked about as if nothing hadhappened.  I found, however, that the skin was not returningcorrectly; and so sent for a doctor:  he treated the thing as quiteinsignificant, but said I must keep my leg quiet for a few days.  Itis still not quite healed; and I lie all day on a sofa, much to mydiscomposure; but the thing is now rapidly disappearing; and I hope,in a day or two more, I shall be free again.  I find I can do no work,while thus crippled in my leg.  The man in Horace who made verses_stans pede in uno_ had the advantage of me."The Great Western came in last night about eleven, and has just beenmaking a flourish past our windows; looking very grand, with fourstreamers of bunting, and one of smoke.  Of course I do not yet knowwhether I have Letters by her, as if so they will have gone to Cliftonfirst.  This place is quiet, green and pleasant; and will suit us verywell, if we have good weather, of which there seems every appearance."Milnes spent last Sunday with me at Clifton; and was very amusing andcordial.  It is impossible for those who know him well not to likehim.--I send this to Knightsbridge, not knowing where else to hit you.Love to my Mother.                          "Your affectionate,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."The expected "Letters by the Great Western" are from Anthony, now inCanada, doing military duties there.  The "Milnes" is our excellentRichard, whom all men know, and truly whom none can know well withouteven doing as Sterling says.--In a week the family had returned toClifton; and Sterling was at his poetizings and equitations again.His grand business was now Poetry; all effort, outlook and aimexclusively directed thither, this good while.Of the published Volume Moxon gave the worst tidings; no man hadhailed it with welcome; unsold it lay, under the leaden seal ofgeneral neglect; the public when asked what it thought, had answeredhitherto by a lazy stare.  It shall answer otherwise, thoughtSterling; by no means taking that as the final response.  It was inthis same September that he announced to me and other friends, underseal of secrecy as usual, the completion, or complete first-draught,of "a new Poem reaching to two thousand verses."  By working "threehours every morning" he had brought it so far.  This Piece, entitled_The Election_, of which in due time we obtained perusal, and had togive some judgment, proved to be in a new vein,--what might be calledthe mock-heroic, or sentimental Hudibrastic, reminding one a little,too, of Wieland's _Oberon_;--it had touches of true drollery combinednot ill with grave clear insight; showed spirit everywhere, and aplainly improved power of execution.  Our stingy verdict was to theeffect, "Better, but still not good enough:--why follow that sad'metrical' course, climbing the loose sandhills, when you have a firmpath along the plain?"  To Sterling himself it remained dubiouswhether so slight a strain, new though it were, would suffice toawaken the sleeping public; and the Piece was thrown away and taken upagain, at intervals; and the question, Publish or not publish? laymany months undecided.Meanwhile his own feeling was now set more and more towards Poetry;and in spite of symptoms and dissuasions, and perverse prognostics ofoutward wind and weather, he was rallying all his force for adownright struggle with it; resolute to see which _was_ the stronger.It must be owned, he takes his failures in the kindliest manner; andgoes along, bating no jot of heart or hope.  Perhaps I should havemore admired this than I did!  My dissuasions, in that case, mighthave been fainter.  But then my sincerity, which was all the use of mypoor counsel in assent or dissent, would have been less.  He was nowfurthermore busy with a _Tragedy of Strafford_, the theme of manyfailures in Tragedy; planning it industriously in his head; eagerlyreading in _Whitlocke, Rushworth_ and the Puritan Books, to attain avesture and local habitation for it.  Faithful assiduous studies I dobelieve;--of which, knowing my stubborn realism, and savage humortowards singing by the Thespian or other methods, he told me little,during his visits that summer.The advance of the dark weather sent him adrift again; to Torquay, forthis winter:  there, in his old Falmouth climate, he hoped to dowell;--and did, so far as well-doing was readily possible, in that sadwandering way of life.  However, be where he may, he tries to work"two or three hours in the morning," were it even "with a lamp," inbed, before the fires are lit; and so makes something of it.  Fromabundant Letters of his now before me, I glean these two or threesmall glimpses; sufficient for our purpose at present.  The generaldate is "Tor, near Torquay:"--                   _To Mrs. Charles Fox, Falmouth_._Tor, November 30th_, 1840.--I reached this place on Thursday; having,after much hesitation, resolved to come here, at least for the nextthree weeks,--with some obscure purpose of embarking, at the New Year,from Falmouth for Malta, and so reaching Naples, which I have notseen.  There was also a doubt whether I should not, after Christmas,bring my family here for the first four months of the year.  All this,however, is still doubtful.  But for certain inhabitants of Falmouthand its neighborhood, this place would be far more attractive than it.But I have here also friends, whose kindness, like much that I metwith last winter, perpetually makes me wonder at the stock ofbenignity in human nature.  A brother of my friend Julius Hare, Marcusby name, a Naval man, and though not a man of letters, full of senseand knowledge, lives here in a beautiful place, with a most agreeableand excellent wife, a daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley.  I hadhardly seen them before; but they are fraternizing with me, in a muchbetter than the Jacobin fashion; and one only feels ashamed at theenormity of some people's good-nature.  I am in a little rural sort oflodging; and as comfortable as a solitary oyster can expect to be."--                            _To C. Barton_."_December 5th_.--This place is extremely small, much more so thanFalmouth even; but pretty, cheerful, and very mild in climate.  Thereare a great many villas in and about the little Town, having three orfour reception-rooms, eight or ten bedrooms; and costing about fifteenhundred or two thousand pounds each, and occupied by persons spendinga thousand or more pounds a year.  If the Country would acknowledge mymerits by the gift of one of these, I could prevail on myself to comeand live here; which would be the best move for my health I could makein England; but, in the absence of any such expression of publicfeeling, it would come rather dear."--                         _To Mrs. Fox again_."_December 22d_.--By the way, did you ever read a Novel?  If you evermean to do so hereafter, let it be Miss Martineau's _Deerbrook_.  Itis really very striking; and parts of it are very true and verybeautiful.  It is not so true, or so thoroughly clear and harmonious,among delineations of English middle-class gentility, as Miss Austen'sbooks, especially as _Pride and Prejudice_, which I think exquisite;but it is worth reading.  _The hour and the Man_ is eloquent, but anabsurd exaggeration.--I hold out so valorously against thisScandinavian weather, that I deserve to be ranked with Odin and Thor;and fancy I may go to live at Clifton or Drontheim.  Have you had thesame icy desolation as prevails here?"                        _To W. Coningham, Esq_."_December 28th_.--Looking back to him [a deceased Uncle, father ofhis correspondent], as I now very often do, I feel strongly, what theloss of other friends has also impressed on me, how much Death deepensour affection; and sharpens our regret for whatever has been evenslightly amiss in our conduct towards those who are gone.  Whattrifles then swell into painful importance; how we believe that, couldthe past be recalled, life would present no worthier, happier task,than that of so bearing ourselves towards those we love, that we mightever after find nothing but melodious tranquillity breathing abouttheir graves!  Yet, too often, I feel the difficulty of alwayspracticing such mild wisdom towards those who are still left me.--Youwill wonder less at my rambling off in this way, when I tell you thatmy little lodging is close to a picturesque old Church and Churchyard,where, every day, I brush past a tombstone, recording that an Italian,of Manferrato, has buried there a girl of sixteen, his only daughter:_'L' unica speranza di mia vita_.'--No doubt, as you say, ourMechanical Age is necessary as a passage to something better; but, atleast, do not let us go back."--At the New-year time, feeling unusually well, he returns to Clifton.His plans, of course, were ever fluctuating; his movements were swiftand uncertain.  Alas, his whole life, especially his winter-life, hadto be built as if on wavering drift-sand; nothing certain in it,except if possible the "two or three hours of work" snatched from thegeneral whirlpool of the dubious four-and-twenty!                           _To Dr. Carlyle_."_Clifton, January 10th_, 1841.--I stood the sharp frost at Torquaywith such entire impunity, that at last I took courage, and resolvedto return home.  I have been here a week, in extreme cold; and havesuffered not at all; so that I hope, with care I may prosper in spiteof medical prognostics,--if you permit such profane language.  I ameven able to work a good deal; and write for some hours every morning,by dint of getting up early, which an Arnott stove in my study enablesme to do."--But at Clifton he cannot continue.  Again, before long,the rude weather has driven him Southward; the spring finds him in hisformer haunts; doubtful as ever what to decide upon for the future;but tending evidently towards a new change of residence for householdand self:--                        _To W. Coningham, Esq_."_Penzance, April 19th_, 1841.--My little Boy and I have beenwandering about between Torquay and this place; and latterly have hadmy Father for a few days with us,--he left us yesterday.  In allprobability I shall endeavor to settle either at Torquay, at Falmouth,or here; as it is pretty clear that I cannot stand the sharp air ofClifton, and still less the London east-winds.  Penzance is, on thewhole, a pleasant-looking, cheerful place; with a delightful mildnessof air, and a great appearance of comfort among the people:  the viewof Mount's Bay is certainly a very noble one.  Torquay would suit thehealth of my Wife and Children better; or else I should be glad tolive here always, London and its neighborhood beingimpracticable."--Such was his second wandering winter; enough torender the prospect of a third at Clifton very uninviting.With the Falmouth friends, young and old, his intercourse hadmeanwhile continued cordial and frequent.  The omens were pointingtowards that region at his next place of abode.  Accordingly, in fewweeks hence, in the June of this Summer, 1841, his dubitations andinquirings are again ended for a time; he has fixed upon a house inFalmouth, and removed thither; bidding Clifton, and the regretfulClifton friends, a kind farewell.  This was the _fifth_ change ofplace for his family since Bayswater; the fifth, and to one chiefmember of it the last.  Mrs. Sterling had brought him a new child inOctober last; and went hopefully to Falmouth, dreading _other_ thanwhat befell there.CHAPTER III.FALMOUTH:  POEMS.At Falmouth, as usual, he was soon at home in his new environment;resumed his labors; had his new small circle of acquaintance, theready and constant centre of which was the Fox family, with whom helived on an altogether intimate, honored and beloved footing;realizing his best anticipations in that respect, which doubtless wereamong his first inducements to settle in this new place.  Open cheeryheights, rather bare of wood:  fresh southwestern breezes; a brisklaughing sea, swept by industrious sails, and the nets of a moststalwart, wholesome, frank and interesting population:  the cleanlittle fishing, trading and packet Town; hanging on its slope towardsthe Eastern sun, close on the waters of its basin and intricatebay,--with the miniature Pendennis Castle seaward on the right, theminiature St. Mawes landward to left, and the mining world and thefarming world open boundlessly to the rear:--all this made a pleasantoutlook and environment.  And in all this, as in the other newelements of his position, Sterling, open beyond most men to the worthof things about him, took his frank share.  From the first, he hadliked the general aspect of the population, and their healthy, livelyways; not to speak of the special friendships he had formed there,which shed a charm over them all.  "Men of strong character, clearheads and genuine goodness," writes he, "are by no means wanting."And long after:  "The common people here dress better than in mostparts of England; and on Sundays, if the weather be at all fine, theirappearance is very pleasant.  One sees them all round the Town,especially towards Pendennis Castle, streaming in a succession oflittle groups, and seeming for the most part really and quietlyhappy."  On the whole he reckoned himself lucky; and, so far aslocality went, found this a handsome shelter for the next two years ofhis life.  Two years, and not without an interruption; that was all.Here we have no continuing city; he less than any of us!  One otherflight for shelter; and then it is ended, and he has found aninexpugnable refuge.  Let us trace his remote footsteps, as we haveopportunity:--                      _To Dr. Symonds, Clifton_."_Falmouth, June 28th_, 1841.--Newman writes to me that he is gone tothe Rhine.  I wish I were!  And yet the only 'wish' at the bottom ofmy heart, is to be able to work vigorously in my own way anywhere,were it in some Circle of Dante's Inferno.  This, however, is thesecret of my soul, which I disclose only to a few."                           _To his Mother_."_Falmouth, July 6th_, 1841.--I have at last my own study madecomfortable; the carpet being now laid down, and most of myappurtenances in tolerable order.  By and by I shall, unless stoppedby illness, get myself together, and begin living an orderly life anddoing my daily task.  I have swung a cot in my dressing-room; partlyas a convenience for myself, partly as a sort of memorial of my poorUncle, in whose cot in his dressing-room at Lisworney I remember tohave slept when a child.  I have put a good large bookcase in mydrawing-room, and all the rest of my books fit very well into thestudy."                           _To Mr. Carlyle_."_July 6th_.--No books have come in my way but Emerson's, which Ivalue full as much as you, though as yet I have read only some cornersof it.  We have had an Election here, of the usual stamp; to me adroll 'realized Ideal,' after my late metrical adventures in thatline.  But the oddest sign of the Times I know, is a cheap Translationof Strauss's _Leben Jesu_, now publishing in numbers, and said to becirculating far and wide.  What does--or rather, what does not--thisportend?"--With the Poem called _The Election_, here alluded to, which had beenmore than once revised and reconsidered, he was still under somehesitations; but at last had well-nigh resolved, as from the first itwas clear he would do, on publishing it.  This occupied someoccasional portion of his thoughts.  But his grand private affair, Ibelieve, was now _Strafford_; to which, or to its adjuncts, allworking hours were devoted.  Sterling's notions of Tragedy are highenough.  This is what he writes once, in reference to his own task inthese weeks:  "Few, I fancy, know how much harder it is to write aTragedy than to realize or be one.  Every man has in his heart andlot, if he pleases, and too many whether they please or no, all thewoes of OEdipus and Antigone.  But it takes the One, the Sophocles ofa thousand years, to utter these in the full depth and harmony ofcreative song.  Curious, by the way, how that Dramatic Form of the oldGreek, with only some superficial changes, remains a law not only forthe stage, but for the thoughts of all Poets; and what a charm it haseven for the reader who never saw a theatre.  The Greek Plays andShakspeare have interested a hundred as books, for one who has seentheir writings acted.  How lightly does the mere clown, the idleschool-girl, build a private theatre in the fancy, and laugh or weepwith Falstaff and Macbeth:  with how entire an oblivion of theartificial nature of the whole contrivance, which thus compels them tobe their own architects, machinists, scene-painters, and actors!  Infact, the artifice succeeds,--becomes grounded in the substance of thesoul:  and every one loves to feel how he is thus brought face to facewith the brave, the fair, the woful and the great of all past ages;looks into their eyes, and feels the beatings of their hearts; andreads, over the shoulder, the secret written tablets of the busiestand the largest brains; while the Juggler, by whose cunning the wholestrange beautiful absurdity is set in motion, keeps himself hidden;sings loud with a mouth unmoving as that of a statue, and makes thehuman race cheat itself unanimously and delightfully by the illusionthat he preordains; while as an obscure Fate, he sits invisible, andhardly lets his being be divined by those who cannot flee him.  TheLyric Art is childish, and the Epic barbarous, compared to this.  Butof the true and perfect Drama it may be said, as of even highermysteries, Who is sufficient for these things?"--On this _Tragedy ofStrafford_, writing it and again writing it, studying for it, andbending himself with his whole strength to do his best on it, heexpended many strenuous months,--"above a year of his life," hecomputes, in all.For the rest, what Falmouth has to give him he is willing to take, andmingles freely in it.  In Hare's Collection there is given a _Lecture_which he read in Autumn, 1841 (Mr. Hare says "1842," by mistake), to acertain Public Institution in the place,--of which more anon;--a pieceinteresting in this, if not much in any other respect.  Doubtless hisfriends the Foxes were at the heart of that lecturing enterprise, andhad urged and solicited him.  Something like proficiency in certainbranches of science, as I have understood, characterized one or moreof this estimable family; love of knowledge, taste for art, wish toconsort with wisdom and wise men, were the tendencies of all; toopulent means superadd the Quaker beneficence, Quaker purity andreverence, there is a circle in which wise men also may love to be.Sterling made acquaintance here with whatever of notable in worthypersons or things might be afoot in those parts; and was led thereby,now and then, into pleasant reunions, in new circles of activity,which might otherwise have continued foreign to him.  The goodCalvert, too, was now here; and intended to remain;--which he mostlydid henceforth, lodging in Sterling's neighborhood, so long as lodgingin this world was permitted him.  Still good and clear and cheerful;still a lively comrade, within doors or without,--a diligent rideralways,--though now wearing visibly weaker, and less able to exerthimself.Among those accidental Falmouth reunions, perhaps the notablest forSterling occurred in this his first season.  There is in Falmouth anAssociation called the _Cornwall Polytechnic Society_, establishedabout twenty years ago, and supported by the wealthy people of theTown and neighborhood, for the encouragement of the arts in thatregion; it has its Library, its Museum, some kind of Annual Exhibitionwithal; gives prizes, publishes reports:  the main patrons, I believe,are Sir Charles Lemon, a well-known country gentleman of those parts,and the Messrs. Fox.  To this, so far as he liked to go in it,Sterling was sure to be introduced and solicited.  The Polytechnicmeeting of 1841 was unusually distinguished; and Sterling's part in itformed one of the pleasant occurrences for him in Falmouth.  It washere that, among other profitable as well as pleasant things, he madeacquaintance with Professor Owen (an event of which I too had mybenefit in due time, and still have):  the bigger assemblage called_British Association_, which met at Plymouth this year, having nowjust finished its affairs there, Owen and other distinguished personshad taken Falmouth in their route from it.  Sterling's account of thisPolytechnic gala still remains,--in three Letters to his Father,which, omitting the extraneous portions, I will give in one,--as apiece worth reading among those still-life pictures:--          "To Edward Sterling, Esq., Knightsbridge, London_.                                         "FALMOUTH, 10th August, 1841."MY DEAR FATHER,--I was not well for a day or two after you went; andsince, I have been busy about an annual show of the PolytechnicSociety here, in which my friends take much interest, and for which Ihave been acting as one of the judges in the department of the FineArts, and have written a little Report for them.  As I have not saidthat Falmouth is as eminent as Athens or Florence, perhaps theCommittee will not adopt my statement.  But if they do, it will be ofsome use; for I have hinted, as delicately as possible, that peopleshould not paint historical pictures before they have the power ofdrawing a decent outline of a pig or a cabbage.  I saw Sir CharlesLemon yesterday, who was kind as well as civil in his manner; andpromises to be a pleasant neighbor.  There are several of the BritishAssociation heroes here; but not Whewell, or any one whom I know.""_August 17th_.--At the Polytechnic Meeting here we had several veryeminent men; among others, Professor Owen, said to be the first ofcomparative anatomists, and Conybeare the geologist.  Both of thesegave evening Lectures; and after Conybeare's, at which I happened tobe present, I said I would, if they chose, make some remarks on theBusts which happened to be standing there, intended for prizes in thedepartment of the Fine Arts.  They agreed gladly.  The heads wereHomer, Pericles, Augustus, Dante and Michael Angelo.  I got into thebox-like platform, with these on a shelf before me; and began a talkwhich must have lasted some three quarters of an hour; describingpartly the characters and circumstances of the men, illustrated byanecdotes and compared with their physiognomies, and partly theseveral styles of sculpture exhibited in the Casts, referring these towhat I considered the true principles of the Art.  The subject was onethat interests me, and I got on in famous style; and had both pit andgalleries all applauding, in a way that had had no precedent duringany other part of the meeting.  Conybeare paid me high compliments;Owen looked much pleased,--an honor well purchased by a year's hardwork;--and everybody, in short, seemed delighted.  Susan was notthere, and I had nothing to make me nervous; so that I worked awayfreely, and got vigorously over the ground.  After so many years'disuse of rhetoric, it was a pleasant surprise to myself to find thatI could still handle the old weapons without awkwardness.  More bygood luck than good guidance, it has done my health no harm.  I havebeen at Sir Charles Lemon's, though only to pay a morning visit,having declined to stay there or dine, the hours not suiting me.  Theywere very civil.  The person I saw most of was his sister, LadyDunstanville; a pleasant, well-informed and well-bred woman.  He seemsa most amiable, kindly man, of fair good sense and cultivatedtastes.--I had a letter to-day from my Mother [in Scotland]; who saysshe sent you one which you were to forward me; which I hope soon tohave.""_August 29th_.--I returned yesterday from Carclew, Sir C. Lemon'sfine place about five miles off; where I had been staying a couple ofdays, with apparently the heartiest welcome.  Susan was asked; butwanting a Governess, could not leave home."Sir Charles is a widower (his Wife was sister to Lord Ilchester)without children; but had a niece staying with him, and his sisterLady Dunstanville, a pleasant and very civil woman.  There were alsoMr. Bunbury, eldest son of Sir Henry Bunbury, a man of muchcultivation and strong talents; Mr. Fox Talbot, son, I think, ofanother Ilchester lady, and brother of _the_ Talbot of Wales, buthimself a man of large fortune, and known for photogenic and otherscientific plans of extracting sunbeams from cucumbers.  He also is aman of known ability, but chiefly employed in that peculiardepartment.  _Item_ Professors Lloyd and Owen:  the former, of Dublin,son of the late Provost, I had seen before and knew; a greatmathematician and optician, and a discoverer in those matters; with aclever little Wife, who has a great deal of knowledge, quite free frompretension.  Owen is a first-rate comparative anatomist, they say thegreatest since Cuvier; lives in London, and lectures there.  On thewhole, he interested me more than any of them,--by an apparent forceand downrightness of mind, combined with much simplicity andfrankness."Nothing could be pleasanter and easier than the habits of life, withwhat to me was a very unusual degree of luxury, though probablynothing but what is common among people of large fortune.  The libraryand pictures are nothing extraordinary.  The general tone of goodnature, good sense and quiet freedom, was what struck me most; and Ithink besides this there was a disposition to be cordially courteoustowards me...."I took Edward a ride of two hours yesterday on Calvert's pony, and heis improving fast in horsemanship.  The school appears to answer verywell.  We shall have the Governess in a day or two, which will be agreat satisfaction.  Will you send my Mother this scribble with mylove; and believe me,                        "Your affectionate son,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."One other little event dwells with me, out of those Falmouth times,exact date now forgotten; a pleasant little matter, in which Sterling,and principally the Misses Fox, bright cheery young creatures, wereconcerned; which, for the sake of its human interest, is worthmention.  In a certain Cornish mine, said the Newspapers dulyspecifying it, two miners deep down in the shaft were engaged puttingin a shot for blasting:  they had completed their affair, and wereabout to give the signal for being hoisted up,--one at a time was alltheir coadjutor at the top could manage, and the second was to kindlethe match, and then mount with all speed.  Now it chanced while theywere both still below, one of them thought the match too long; triedto break it shorter, took a couple of stones, a flat and a sharp, tocut it shorter; did cut it of the due length, but, horrible to relate,kindled it at the same time, and both were still below!  Both shoutedvehemently to the coadjutor at the windlass, both sprang at thebasket; the windlass man could not move it with them both.  Here was amoment for poor miner Jack and miner Will!  Instant horrible deathhangs over both,--when Will generously resigns himself:  "Go aloft,Jack," and sits down; "away; in one minute I shall be in Heaven!"Jack bounds aloft, the explosion instantly follows, bruises his faceas he looks over; he is safe above ground:  and poor Will?  Descendingeagerly they find Will too, as if by miracle, buried under rocks whichhad arched themselves over him, and little injured:  he too is broughtup safe, and all ends joyfully, say the Newspapers.Such a piece of manful promptitude, and salutary human heroism, wasworth investigating.  It was investigated; found to be accurate to theletter,--with this addition and explanation, that Will, an honest,ignorant good man, entirely given up to Methodism, had been perfect inthe "faith of assurance," certain that _he_ should get to Heaven if hedied, certain that Jack would not, which had been the ground of hisdecision in that great moment;--for the rest, that he much wished tolearn reading and writing, and find some way of life above groundinstead of below.  By aid of the Misses Fox and the rest of thatfamily, a subscription (modest _Anti_-Hudson testimonial) was raisedto this Methodist hero:  he emerged into daylight with fifty pounds inhis pocket; did strenuously try, for certain months, to learn readingand writing; found he could not learn those arts or either of them;took his money and bought cows with it, wedding at the same time somereligious likely milkmaid; and is, last time I heard of him, aprosperous modest dairyman, thankful for the upper light and safetyfrom the wrath to come.  Sterling had some hand in this affair:  but,as I said, it was the two young ladies of the family that mainly didit.In the end of 1841, after many hesitations and revisals, _TheElection_ came out; a tiny Duodecimo without name attached;[24] againinquiring of the public what its suffrage was; again to littlepurpose.  My vote had never been loud for this step, but neither wasit quite adverse; and now, in reading the poor little Poem over again,after ten years' space, I find it, with a touching mixture of pleasureand repentance, considerably better than it then seemed to me.  Myencouragement, if not to print this poem, yet to proceed with Poetry,since there was such a resolution for it, might have been a littlemore decided!This is a small Piece, but aims at containing great things; a _multumin parvo_ after its sort; and is executed here and there withundeniable success.  The style is free and flowing, the rhyme dancesalong with a certain joyful triumph; everything of due brevity withal.That mixture of mockery on the surface, which finely relieves the realearnestness within, and flavors even what is not very earnest andmight even be insipid otherwise, is not ill managed:  an amalgamdifficult to effect well in writing; nay, impossible inwriting,--unless it stand already done and effected, as a generalfact, in the writer's mind and character; which will betoken a certainripeness there.As I said, great things are intended in this little Piece; the mottoitself foreshadowing them:--     "_Fluellen_.   Ancient Pistol, I do partly understand your                    meaning.     _Pistol_.      Why, then, rejoice therefor."A stupid commonplace English Borough has lost its Member suddenly, byapoplexy or otherwise; resolves, in the usual explosive temper ofmind, to replace him by one of two others; whereupon strangestirring-up of rival-attorney and other human interests andcatastrophes.  "Frank Vane" (Sterling himself), and "Peter Mogg," thepattern English blockhead of elections:  these are the candidates.There are, of course, fierce rival attorneys; electors of all creedsand complexions to be canvassed:  a poor stupid Borough thrown allinto red or white heat; into blazing paroxysms of activity andenthusiasm, which render the inner life of it (and of England and theworld through it) luminously transparent, so to speak;--of whichopportunity our friend and his "Muse" take dexterous advantage, todelineate the same.  His pictures are uncommonly good; brief, joyous,sometimes conclusively true:  in rigorously compressed shape; all ismerry freshness and exuberance:  we have leafy summer embowering redbricks and small human interests, presented as in glowing miniature; amock-heroic action fitly interwoven;--and many a clear glance iscarelessly given into the deepest things by the way.  Very happy alsois the little love-episode; and the absorption of all the interestinto that, on the part of Frank Vane and of us, when once this gallantFrank,--having fairly from his barrel-head stated his own (and JohnSterling's) views on the aspects of the world, and of course havingquite broken down with his attorney and his public,--handsomely, bystratagem, gallops off with the fair Anne; and leaves free field toMogg, free field to the Hippopotamus if it like.  This portrait ofMogg may be considered to have merit:--     "Though short of days, how large the mind of man;     A godlike force enclosed within a span!     To climb the skies we spurn our nature's clog,     And toil as Titans to elect a Mogg.          "And who was Mogg?  O Muse! the man declare,     How excellent his worth, his parts how rare.     A younger son, he learnt in Oxford's halls     The spheral harmonies of billiard-balls,     Drank, hunted, drove, and hid from Virtue's frown     His venial follies in Decorum's gown.     Too wise to doubt on insufficient cause,     He signed old Cranmer's lore without a pause;     And knew that logic's cunning rules are taught     To guard our creed, and not invigorate thought,--     As those bronze steeds at Venice, kept for pride,     Adorn a Town where not one man can ride.          "From Isis sent with all her loud acclaims,     The Laws he studied on the banks of Thames.     Park, race and play, in his capacious plan,     Combined with Coke to form the finished man,     Until the wig's ambrosial influence shed     Its last full glories on the lawyer's head.          "But vain are mortal schemes.  The eldest son     At Harrier Hall had scarce his stud begun,     When Death's pale courser took the Squire away     To lands where never dawns a hunting day:     And so, while Thomas vanished 'mid the fog,     Bright rose the morning-star of Peter Mogg."[25]And this little picture, in a quite opposite way:--     "Now, in her chamber all alone, the maid     Her polished limbs and shoulders disarrayed;     One little taper gave the only light,     One little mirror caught so dear a sight;     'Mid hangings dusk and shadows wide she stood,     Like some pale Nymph in dark-leafed solitude     Of rocks and gloomy waters all alone,     Where sunshine scarcely breaks on stump or stone     To scare the dreamy vision.  Thus did she,     A star in deepest night, intent but free,     Gleam through the eyeless darkness, heeding not     Her beauty's praise, but musing o'er her lot.          "Her garments one by one she laid aside,     And then her knotted hair's long locks untied     With careless hand, and down her cheeks they fell,     And o'er her maiden bosom's blue-veined swell.     The right-hand fingers played amidst her hair,     And with her reverie wandered here and there:     The other hand sustained the only dress     That now but half concealed her loveliness;     And pausing, aimlessly she stood and thought,     In virgin beauty by no fear distraught."Manifold, and beautiful of their sort, are Anne's musings, in thisinteresting attitude, in the summer midnight, in the crisis of herdestiny now near;--at last:--     "But Anne, at last her mute devotions o'er,     Perceived the feet she had forgot before     Of her too shocking nudity; and shame     Flushed from her heart o'er all the snowy frame:     And, struck from top to toe with burning dread,     She blew the light out, and escaped to bed."[26]--which also is a very pretty movement.It must be owned withal, the Piece is crude in parts, and far enoughfrom perfect.  Our good painter has yet several things to learn, andto unlearn.  His brush is not always of the finest; and dashes about,sometimes, in a recognizably sprawling way:  but it hits many afeature with decisive accuracy and felicity; and on the palette, asusual, lie the richest colors.  A grand merit, too, is the brevity ofeverything; by no means a spontaneous, or quite common merit withSterling.This new poetic Duodecimo, as the last had done and as the next alsodid, met with little or no recognition from the world:  which was notvery inexcusable on the world's part; though many a poem with far lessproof of merit than this offers, has run, when the accidents favoredit, through its tens of editions, and raised the writer to thedemigods for a year or two, if not longer.  Such as it is, we may takeit as marking, in its small way, in a noticed or unnoticed manner, anew height arrived at by Sterling in his Poetic course; and almost asvindicating the determination he had formed to keep climbing by thatmethod.  Poor Poem, or rather Promise of a Poem!  In Sterling's bravestruggle, this little _Election_ is the highest point he fairly livedto see attained, and openly demonstrated in print.  His next publicadventure in this kind was of inferior worth; and a third, which hadperhaps intrinsically gone much higher than any of its antecessors,was cut off as a fragment, and has not hitherto been published.Steady courage is needed on the Poetic course, as on all courses!--Shortly after this Publication, in the beginning of 1842, poorCalvert, long a hopeless sufferer, was delivered by death:  Sterling'sfaithful fellow-pilgrim could no more attend him in his wayfaringsthrough this world.  The weary and heavy-laden man had borne hisburden well.  Sterling says of him to Hare:  "Since I wrote last, Ihave lost Calvert; the man with whom, of all others, I have beenduring late years the most intimate.  Simplicity, benevolence,practical good sense and moral earnestness were his great unfailingcharacteristics; and no man, I believe, ever possessed them moreentirely.  His illness had latterly so prostrated him, both in mindand body, that those who most loved him were most anxious for hisdeparture."  There was something touching in this exit; in thequenching of so kind and bright a little life under the dark billowsof death.  To me he left a curious old Print of James Nayler theQuaker, which I still affectionately preserve.Sterling, from this greater distance, came perhaps rather seldomer toLondon; but we saw him still at moderate intervals; and, through hisfamily here and other direct and indirect channels, were kept inlively communication with him.  Literature was still his constantpursuit; and, with encouragement or without, Poetic composition hischosen department therein.  On the ill success of _The Election_, orany ill success with the world, nobody ever heard him utter the leastmurmur; condolence upon that or any such subject might have been aquestionable operation, by no means called for!  Nay, my own approval,higher than this of the world, had been languid, by no meansenthusiastic.  But our valiant friend took all quietly; and was not tobe repulsed from his Poetics either by the world's coldness or bymine; he labored at his _Strafford_;--determined to labor, in allways, till he felt the end of his tether in this direction.He sometimes spoke, with a certain zeal, of my starting a Periodical:Why not lift up some kind of war-flag against the obese platitudes,and sickly superstitious aperies and impostures of the time?  But Ihad to answer, "Who will join it, my friend?"  He seemed to say, "I,for one;" and there was occasionally a transient temptation in thethought, but transient only.  No fighting regiment, with the smallestattempt towards drill, co-operation, commissariat, or the likeunspeakable advantages, could be raised in Sterling's time or mine;which truly, to honest fighters, is a rather grievous want.  Agrievous, but not quite a fatal one.  For, failing this, failing allthings and all men, there remains the solitary battle (and were it bythe poorest weapon, the tongue only, or were it even by wiseabstinence and silence and without any weapon), such as each man forhimself can wage while he has life:  an indubitable and infinitelycomfortable fact for every man!  Said battle shaped itself forSterling, as we have long since seen, chiefly in the poetic form, inthe singing or hymning rather than the speaking form; and in that hewas cheerfully assiduous according to his light.  The unfortunate_Strafford_ is far on towards completion; a _Coeur-de-Lion_, of whichwe shall hear farther, "_Coeur-de-Lion_, greatly the best of all hisPoems," unluckily not completed, and still unpublished, already hangsin the wind.His Letters to friends continue copious; and he has, as always, aloyally interested eye on whatsoever of notable is passing in theworld.  Especially on whatsoever indicates to him the spiritualcondition of the world.  Of "Strauss," in English or in German, we nowhear nothing more; of Church matters, and that only to specialcorrespondents, less and less.  Strauss, whom he used to mention, hadinterested him only as a sign of the times; in which sense alone do wefind, for a year or two back, any notice of the Church, or its affairsby Sterling; and at last even this as good as ceases:  "Adieu, OChurch; thy road is that way, mine is this:  in God's name, adieu!""What we are going _to_," says he once, "is abundantly obscure; butwhat all men are going _from_, is very plain."--Sifted out of manypages, not of sufficient interest, here are one or two miscellaneoussentences, about the date we are now arrived at:--                           _To Dr. Symonds_."_Falmouth, 3d November_, 1841.--Yesterday was my Wedding-day:  elevenyears of marriage; and on the whole my verdict is clear for matrimony.I solemnized the day by reading _John Gilpin_ to the children, whowith their Mother are all pretty well....  There is a trick of shamElizabethan writing now prevalent, that looks plausible, but in mostcases means nothing at all.  Darley has real (lyrical) genius; Taylor,wonderful sense, clearness and weight of purpose; Tennyson, a rich andexquisite fancy.  All the other men of our tiny generation that I knowof are, in Poetry, either feeble or fraudulent.  I know nothing of theReviewer you ask about."                            _To his Mother_"_December 11th_.--I have seen no new books; but am reading your last.I got hold of the two first Numbers of the _Hoggarty Diamond_; andread them with extreme delight.  What is there better in Fielding orGoldsmith?  The man is a true genius; and, with quiet and comfort,might produce masterpieces that would last as long as any we have, anddelight millions of unborn readers.  There is more truth and nature inone of these papers than in all ----'s Novels together."--Thackeray,always a close friend of the Sterling house, will observe that this isdated 1841, not 1851, and have his own reflections on the matter!                            _To the Same_."_December 17th_.--I am not much surprised at Lady ----'s views ofColeridge's little Book on _Inspiration_.--Great part of the obscurityof the Letters arises from his anxiety to avoid the difficulties andabsurdities of the common views, and his panic terror of sayinganything that bishops and good people would disapprove.  He paid aheavy price, viz. all his own candor and simplicity, in hope ofgaining the favor of persons like Lady ----; and you see what hisreward is!  A good lesson for us all."                            _To the Same_."_February 1st_, 1842.--English Toryism has, even in my eyes, about asmuch to say for itself as any other form of doctrine; but IrishToryism is the downright proclamation of brutal injustice, and all inthe name of God and the Bible!  It is almost enough to make one turnMahometan, but for the fear of the four wives."                           _To his Father_."_March 12th_, 1842.--... Important to me as these matters are, italmost seems as if there were something unfeeling in writing of them,under the pressure of such news as ours from India.  If the CaboolTroops have perished, England has not received such a blow from anenemy, nor anything approaching it, since Buckingham's Expedition tothe Isle of Rhe.  Walcheren destroyed us by climate; and Corunna, withall its losses, had much of glory.  But here we are dismally injuredby mere Barbarians, in a War on our part shamefully unjust as well asfoolish:  a combination of disgrace and calamity that would haveshocked Augustus even more than the defeat of Varus.  One of the fourofficers with Macnaghten was George Lawrence, a brother-in-law of NatBarton; a distinguished man, and the father of five totally unprovidedchildren.  He is a prisoner, if not since murdered.  Macnaghten I donot pity; he was the prime author of the whole mad War.  But Burnes;and the women; and our regiments!  India, however, I feel sure, issafe."So roll the months at Falmouth; such is the ticking of the greatWorld-Horologe as heard there by a good ear.  "I willingly add," soends he, once, "that I lately found somewhere this fragment of anArab's love-song:  'O Ghalia!  If my father were a jackass, I wouldsell him to purchase Ghalia!'  A beautiful parallel to the French_'Avec cette sauce on mangerait son pere_.'"CHAPTER IV.NAPLES:  POEMS.In the bleak weather of this spring, 1842, he was again abroad for alittle while; partly from necessity, or at least utility; and partly,as I guess, because these circumstances favored, and he could with agood countenance indulge a little wish he had long had.  In theItalian Tour, which ended suddenly by Mrs. Sterling's illnessrecalling him, he had missed Naples; a loss which he always thought tobe considerable; and which, from time to time, he had formed littleprojects, failures hitherto, for supplying.  The rigors of spring werealways dangerous to him in England, and it was always of advantage toget out of them:  and then the sight of Naples, too; this, always athing to be done some day, was now possible.  Enough, with the real orimaginary hope of bettering himself in health, and the certain one ofseeing Naples, and catching a glance of Italy again, he now made a runthither.  It was not long after Calvert's death.  The Tragedy of_Strafford_ lay finished in his desk.  Several things, sad and bright,were finished.  A little intermezzo of ramble was not unadvisable.His tour by water and by land was brief and rapid enough; hardly abovetwo months in all.  Of which the following Letters will, with someabridgment, give us what details are needful:--                "_To Charles Barton, Esq., Leamington_.                                          "FALMOUTH, 25th March, 1842."MY DEAR CHARLES,--My attempts to shoot you flying with my paperpellets turned out very ill.  I hope young ladies succeed better whenthey happen to make appointments with you.  Even now, I hardly knowwhether you have received a Letter I wrote on Sunday last, andaddressed to The Cavendish.  I sent it thither by Susan's advice."In this missive,--happily for us both, it did not contain ahundred-pound note or any trifle of that kind,--I informed you that Iwas compelled to plan an expedition towards the South Pole; stopping,however, in the Mediterranean; and that I designed leaving this onMonday next for Cadiz or Gibraltar, and then going on to Malta, whenceItaly and Sicily would be accessible.  Of course your company would bea great pleasure, if it were possible for you to join me.  The delayin hearing from you, through no fault of yours, has naturally put meout a little; but, on the whole, my plan still holds, and I shallleave this on Monday for Gibraltar, where the _Great Liverpool_ willcatch me, and carry me to Malta.  The _Great Liverpool_ leavesSouthampton on the 1st of April, and Falmouth on the 2d; and willreach Gibraltar in from four to five days."Now, if you _should_ be able and disposed to join me, you have onlyto embark in that sumptuous tea-kettle, and pick me up under the gunsof the Rock.  We could then cruise on to Malta, Sicily, Naples, Rome,&c., _a discretion_.  It is just _possible_, though extremelyimprobable, that my steamer of Monday (most likely the _Montrose_) maynot reach Gibraltar so soon as the _Liverpool_.  If so, and if youshould actually be on board, you must stop at Gibraltar.  But thereare ninety-nine chances to one against this.  Write at all events toSusan, to let her know what you propose."I do not wait till the _Great Liverpool_ goes, because the object forme is to get into a warm climate as soon as possible.  I am decidedlybetter.

"MALTA, 14th April, 1842."DEAREST MOTHER,--I am writing to Susan through France, by to-morrow'smail; and will also send you a line, instead of waiting for the longerEnglish conveyance."We reached this the day before yesterday, in the evening; having hada strong breeze against us for a day or two before; which made meextremely uncomfortable,--and indeed my headache is hardly gone yet.From about the 4th to the 9th of the month, we had beautiful weather,and I was happy enough.  You will see by the map that the straightestline from Gibraltar to this place goes close along the African coast;which accordingly we saw with the utmost clearness; and found itgenerally a line of mountains, the higher peaks and ridges coveredwith snow.  We went close in to Algiers; which looks strong, butentirely from art.  The town lies on the slope of a straight coast;and is not at all embayed, though there is some little shelter forshipping within the mole.  It is a square patch of white buildingshuddled together; fringed with batteries; and commanded by large fortson the ridge above:  a most uncomfortable-looking place; though, nodoubt, there are _cafes_ and billiard-rooms and a theatre within,--forthe French like to have their Houris, &c., on _this_ side of Paradise,if possible."Our party of fifty people (we had taken some on board at Gibraltar)broke up, on reaching this; never, of course, to meet again.  Thegreater part do not proceed to Alexandria.  Considering that there wasa bundle of midshipmen, ensigns, &c., we had as much reason among usas could perhaps be looked for; and from several I gained bits ofinformation and traits of character, though nothing veryremarkable...."I have established myself in an inn, rather than go to LadyLouis's;[27] I not feeling quite equal to company, except in moderate doses.  Ihave, however, seen her a good deal; and dine there to-day, veryprivately, for Sir John is not quite well, and they will have noguests.  The place, however, is full of official banqueting, forvarious unimportant reasons.  When here before, I was in much distressand anxiety, on my way from Rome; and I suppose this it was thatprevented its making the same impression on me as now, when it seemsreally the stateliest town I have ever seen.  The architecture isgenerally of a corrupt Roman kind; with something of the varied andpicturesque look, though much more massive, of our Elizabethanbuildings.  We have the finest English summer and a pellucid sky....Your affectionate                                                      "JOHN STERLING."At Naples next, for three weeks, was due admiration of the sceneriesand antiquities, Bay and Mountain, by no means forgetting Art and theMuseum:  "to Pozzuoli, to Baiae, round the Promontory ofSorrento;"--above all, "twice to Pompeii," where the elegance andclassic simplicity of Ancient Housekeeping strikes us much; and againto Paestum, where "the Temple of Neptune is far the noblest building Ihave ever seen; and makes both Greek and Revived Roman seem quitebarbaric....  Lord Ponsonby lodges in the same house with me;--but, ofcourse, I do not countenance an adherent of a beaten Party!"[28]--Orlet us take this more compendious account, which has much more ofhuman in it, from an onward stage, ten days later:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                                                "ROME, 13th May, 1842,"MY DEAR CARLYLE,--I hope I wrote to you before leaving England, totell you of the necessity for my doing so.  Though coming to Italy,there was little comfort in the prospect of being divided from myfamily, and pursuits which grew on me every day.  However, I tried tomake the best of it, and have gained both health and pleasure."In spite of scanty communications from England (owing to theuncertainty of my position), a word or two concerning you and yourdear Wife have reached me.  Lately it has often occurred to me, thatthe sight of the Bay of Naples, of the beautiful coast from that tothis place, and of Rome itself, all bathed in summer sunshine, andgreen with spring foliage, would be some consolation to her.[29]  Praygive her my love."I have been two days here; and almost the first thing I did was tovisit the Protestant burial-ground, and the graves of those I knewwhen here before.  But much as being now alone here, I feel thedifference, there is no scene where Death seems so little dreadful andmiserable as in the lonelier neighborhoods of this old place.  Allone's impressions, however, as to that and everything else, appear tome, on reflection, more affected than I had for a long time any notionof, by one's own isolation.  All the feelings and activities whichfamily, friends and occupation commonly engage, are turned, here inone's solitude, with strange force into the channels of mereobservation and contemplation; and the objects one is conversant withseem to gain a tenfold significance from the abundance of spareinterest one now has to bestow on them.  This explains to me a gooddeal of the peculiar effect that Italy has always had on me:  andsomething of that artistic enthusiasm which I remember you used tothink so singular in Goethe's _Travels_.  Darley, who is as much abrooding hermit in England as here, felt nothing but disappointmentfrom a country which fills me with childish wonder and delight."Of you I have received some slight notice from Mrs. Strachey; who ison her way hither; and will (she writes) be at Florence on the 15th,and here before the end of the month.  She notices having received aLetter of yours which had pleased her much.  She now proposes spendingthe summer at Sorrento, or thereabouts; and if mere delight oflandscape and climate were enough, Adam and Eve, had their couriertaken them to that region, might have done well enough withoutParadise,--and not been tempted, either, by any Tree of Knowledge; akind that does not flourish in the Two Sicilies."The ignorance of the Neapolitans, from the highest to the lowest, isvery eminent; and excites the admiration of all the rest of Italy.  Inthe great building containing all the Works of Art, and a Library of150,000 volumes, I asked for the best existing Book (a German onepublished ten years ago) on the Statues in that very Collection; and,after a rabble of clerks and custodes, got up to a dirty priest, whobowing to the ground regretted 'they did not possess it,' but at lastremembered that 'they _had_ entered into negotiations on the subject,which as yet had been unsuccessful.'--The favorite device on the wallsat Naples is a vermilion Picture of a Male and Female Soulrespectively up to the waist (the waist of a _soul_) in fire, and anAngel above each, watering the sufferers from a watering-pot.  This isintended to gain alms for Masses.  The same populace sit for hours onthe Mole, listening to rhapsodists who recite Ariosto.  I have seen Ithink five of them all within a hundred yards of each other, and somesets of fiddlers to boot.  Yet there are few parts of the world whereI have seen less laughter than there.  The Miracle of Januarius'sBlood is, on the whole, my most curious experience.  The furiousentreaties, shrieks and sobs, of a set of old women, yelling till theMiracle was successfully performed, are things never to be forgotten."I spent three weeks in this most glittering of countries, and sawmost of the usual wonders,--the Paestan Temples being to me much themost valuable.  But Pompeii and all that it has yielded, especiallythe Fresco Paintings, have also an infinite interest.  When oneconsiders that this prodigious series of beautiful designs suppliedthe place of our common room-papers,--the wealth of poetic imageryamong the Ancients, and the corresponding traditional variety andelegance of pictorial treatment, seem equally remarkable.  The Greekand Latin Books do not give one quite so fully this sort ofimpression; because they afford no direct measure of the extent oftheir own diffusion.  But these are ornaments from the smaller classof decent houses in a little Country Town; and the greater number ofthem, by the slightness of the execution, show very clearly that theywere adapted to ordinary taste, and done by mere artisans.  In generalclearness, symmetry and simplicity of feeling, I cannot say that, onthe whole, the works of Raffaelle equal them; though of course he hasendless beauties such as we could not find unless in the greatoriginal works from which these sketches at Pompeii were taken.  Yetwith all my much increased reverence for the Greeks, it seems moreplain than ever that they had hardly anything of the peculiardevotional feeling of Christianity."Rome, which I loved before above all the earth, now delights me morethan ever;--though at this moment there is rain falling that would notdiscredit Oxford Street.  The depth, sincerity and splendor that thereonce was in the semi-paganism of the old Catholics comes out in St.Peter's and its dependencies, almost as grandly as does Greek andRoman Art in the Forum and the Vatican Galleries.  I wish you werehere:  but, at all events, hope to see you and your Wife once moreduring this summer.                                "Yours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."At Paris, where he stopped a day and night, and generally through hiswhole journey from Marseilles to Havre, one thing attended him:  theprevailing epidemic of the place and year; now gone, and nighforgotten, as other influenzas are.  He writes to his Father:  "I havenot yet met a single Frenchman, who could give me any rationalexplanation _why_ they were all in such a confounded rage against us.Definite causes of quarrel a statesman may know how to deal with,inasmuch as the removal of them may help to settle the dispute.  Butit must be a puzzling task to negotiate about instincts; to whichclass, as it seems to me, we must have recourse for an understandingof the present abhorrence which everybody on the other side of theChannel not only feels, but makes a point to boast of, against thename of Britain.  France is slowly arming, especially with Steam, _enattendant_ a more than possible contest, in which they reckonconfidently on the eager co-operation of the Yankees; as, _viceversa_, an American told me that his countrymen do on that of France.One person at Paris (M. ---- whom you know) provoked me to tell himthat 'England did not want another battle of Trafalgar; but if Francedid, she might compel England to gratify her.'"--After a couple ofpleasant and profitable months, he was safe home again in the firstdays of June; and saw Falmouth not under gray iron skies, and whirlsof March dust, but bright with summer opulence and the roses comingout.It was what I call his "_fifth_ peregrinity;" his fifth and last.  Hesoon afterwards came up to London; spent a couple of weeks, with allhis old vivacity, among us here.  The AEsculapian oracles, it wouldappear, gave altogether cheerful prophecy; the highest medicalauthority "expresses the most decided opinion that I have graduallymended for some years; and in truth I have not, for six or seven, beenso free from serious symptoms of illness as at present."  So uncertainare all oracles, AEsculapian and other!During this visit, he made one new acquaintance which he much valued;drawn thither, as I guess, by the wish to take counsel about_Strafford_.  He writes to his Clifton friend, under date, 1st July1842:  "Lockhart, of the _Quarterly Review_, I made my first oralacquaintance with; and found him as neat, clear and cutting a brain asyou would expect; but with an amount of knowledge, good nature andliberal anti-bigotry, that would much surprise many.  The tone of hischildren towards him seemed to me decisive of his real kindness.  Hequite agreed with me as to the threatening seriousness of our presentsocial perplexities, and the necessity and difficulty of doingsomething effectual for so satisfying the manual multitude as not tooverthrow all legal security...."Of other persons whom I saw in London," continues he, "there areseveral that would much interest you,--though I missed Tennyson, by amere chance....  John Mill has completely finished, and sent to thebookseller, his great work on Logic; the labor of many years of asingularly subtle, patient and comprehensive mind.  It will be ourchief speculative monument of this age.  Mill and I could not meetabove two or three times; but it was with the openness and freshnessof school-boy friends, though our friendship only dates from themanhood of both."He himself was busier than ever; occupied continually with all mannerof Poetic interests.  _Coeur-de-Lion_, a new and more elaborateattempt in the mock-heroic or comico-didactic vein, had been on handfor some time, the scope of it greatly deepening and expanding itselfsince it first took hold of him; and now, soon after the Naplesjourney, it rose into shape on the wider plan; shaken up probably bythis new excitement, and indebted to Calabria, Palermo and theMediterranean scenes for much of the vesture it had.  With this, whichopened higher hopes for him than any of his previous efforts, he wasnow employing all his time and strength;--and continued to do so, thisbeing the last effort granted him among us.Already, for some months, _Strafford_ lay complete:  but how to get itfrom the stocks; in what method to launch it?  The step wasquestionable.  Before going to Italy he had sent me the Manuscript;still loyal and friendly; and willing to hear the worst that could besaid of his poetic enterprise.  I had to afflict him again, the goodbrave soul, with the deliberate report that I could _not_ accept thisDrama as his Picture of the Life of Strafford, or as any _Picture_ ofthat strange Fact.  To which he answered, with an honest manfulness,in a tone which is now pathetic enough to me, that he was much grievedyet much obliged, and uncertain how to decide.  On the other hand, Mr.Hare wrote, warmly eulogizing.  Lockhart too spoke kindly, thoughtaking some exceptions.  It was a questionable case.  On the whole,_Strafford_ remained, for the present, unlaunched; and _Coeur de-Lion_was getting its first timbers diligently laid down.  So passed, inpeaceable seclusion, in wholesome employment and endeavor, the autumnand winter of 1842-43.  On Christmas-day, he reports to his Mother:--"I wished to write to you yesterday; but was prevented by theimportant business of preparing a Tree, in the German fashion, for thechildren.  This project answered perfectly, as it did last year; andgave them the greatest pleasure.  I wish you and my Father could havebeen here to see their merry faces.  Johnny was in the thick of thefun, and much happier than Lord Anson on capturing the galleon.  Weare all going on well and quietly, but with nothing very new amongus....  The last book I have lighted on is Moffat's _Missionary Laborsin South Africa_; which is worth reading.  There is the bestcollection of lion stories in it that I have ever seen.  But the manis, also, really a very good fellow; and fit for something much betterthan most lions are.  He is very ignorant, and mistaken in somethings; but has strong sense and heart; and his Narrative adds anotherto the many proofs of the enormous power of Christianity on rudeminds.  Nothing can be more chaotic, that is human at all, than thenotions of these poor Blacks, even after what is called theirconversion; but the effect is produced.  They do adopt pantaloons, andabandon polygamy; and I suppose will soon have newspapers and literarysoirees."CHAPTER V.DISASTER ON DISASTER.DURING all these years of struggle and wayfaring, his Father'shousehold at Knightsbridge had stood healthful, happy, increasing inwealth, free diligence, solidity and honest prosperity:  a fixed sunnyislet, towards which, in all his voyagings and overclouded roamings,he could look with satisfaction, as to an ever-open port of refuge.The elder Sterling, after many battles, had reached his field ofconquest in these years; and was to be regarded as a victorious man.Wealth sufficient, increasing not diminishing, had rewarded his laborsin the _Times_, which were now in their full flower; he had influenceof a sort; went busily among busy public men; and enjoyed, in thequestionable form attached to journalism and anonymity, a socialconsideration and position which were abundantly gratifying to him.  Asingular figure of the epoch; and when you came to know him, which itwas easy to fail of doing if you had not eyes and candid insight, agallant, truly gifted, and manful figure, of his kind.  We saw much ofhim in this house; much of all his family; and had grown to love themall right well,--him too, though that was the difficult part of thefeat.  For in his Irish way he played the conjurer very much,--"threehundred and sixty-five opinions in the year upon every subject," as awag once said.  In fact his talk, ever ingenious, emphatic andspirited in detail, was much defective in earnestness, at least inclear earnestness, of purport and outcome; but went tumbling as if inmere welters of explosive unreason; a volcano heaving under vaguedeluges of scoriae, ashes and imponderous pumice-stones, you could notsay in what direction, nor well whether in any.  Not till after goodstudy did you see the deep molten lava-flood, which simmered steadilyenough, and showed very well by and by whither it was bound.  For Imust say of Edward Sterling, after all his daily explosivesophistries, and fallacies of talk, he had a stubborn instinctivesense of what was manful, strong and worthy; recognized, with quickfeeling, the charlatan under his solemnest wig; knew as clearly as anyman a pusillanimous tailor in buckram, an ass under the lion's skin,and did with his whole heart despise the same.The sudden changes of doctrine in the _Times_, which failed not toexcite loud censure and indignant amazement in those days, were firstintelligible to you when you came to interpret them as his changes.These sudden whirls from east to west on his part, and total changesof party and articulate opinion at a day's warning, lay in the natureof the man, and could not be helped; products of his fiery impatience,of the combined impetuosity and limitation of an intellect, which didnevertheless continually gravitate towards what was loyal, true andright on all manner of subjects.  These, as I define them, were themere scoriae and pumice wreck of a steady central lava-flood, whichtruly was volcanic and explosive to a strange degree, but did rest asfew others on the grand fire-depths of the world.  Thus, if he stormedalong, ten thousand strong, in the time of the Reform Bill,indignantly denouncing Toryism and its obsolete insane pretensions;and then if, after some experience of Whig management, he discernedthat Wellington and Peel, by whatever name entitled, were the men tobe depended on by England,--there lay in all this, visible enough, adeeper consistency far more important than the superficial one, somuch clamored after by the vulgar.  Which is the lion's-skin; which isthe real lion?  Let a man, if he is prudent, ascertain that beforespeaking;--but above and beyond all things, _let_ him ascertain it,and stand valiantly to it when ascertained!  In the latter essentialpart of the operation Edward Sterling was honorably successful to areally marked degree; in the former, or prudential part, very much thereverse, as his history in the Journalistic department at least, wascontinually teaching him.An amazingly impetuous, hasty, explosive man, this "CaptainWhirlwind," as I used to call him!  Great sensibility lay in him, too;a real sympathy, and affectionate pity and softness, which he had anover-tendency to express even by tears,--a singular sight in soleonine a man.  Enemies called them maudlin and hypocritical, thesetears; but that was nowise the complete account of them.  On thewhole, there did conspicuously lie a dash of ostentation, aself-consciousness apt to become loud and braggart, over all he saidand did and felt:  this was the alloy of the man, and you had to bethankful for the abundant gold along with it.Quizzing enough he got among us for all this, and for the singular_chiaroscuro_ manner of procedure, like that of an ArchimagusCagliostro, or Kaiser Joseph Incognito, which his anonymousknown-unknown thunderings in the _Times_ necessitated in him; and muchwe laughed,--not without explosive counter-banterings on hispart;--but, in fine, one could not do without him; one knew him atheart for a right brave man.  "By Jove, sir!" thus he would swear toyou, with radiant face; sometimes, not often, by a deeper oath.  Withpersons of dignity, especially with women, to whom he was always verygallant, he had courtly delicate manners, verging towards thewire-drawn and elaborate; on common occasions, he bloomed out at onceinto jolly familiarity of the gracefully boisterous kind, remindingyou of mess-rooms and old Dublin days.  His off-hand mode of speechwas always precise, emphatic, ingenious:  his laugh, which wasfrequent rather than otherwise, had a sincerity of banter, but no realdepth of sense for the ludicrous; and soon ended, if it grew too loud,in a mere dissonant scream.  He was broad, well-built, stout ofstature; had a long lowish head, sharp gray eyes, with large strongaquiline face to match; and walked, or sat, in an erect decisivemanner.  A remarkable man; and playing, especially in those years1830-40, a remarkable part in the world.For it may be said, the emphatic, big-voiced, always influential andoften strongly unreasonable _Times_ Newspaper was the express emblemof Edward Sterling; he, more than any other man or circumstance, _was_the _Times_ Newspaper, and thundered through it to the shaking of thespheres.  And let us assert withal that his and its influence, inthose days, was not ill grounded but rather well; that the loudmanifold unreason, often enough vituperated and groaned over, was ofthe surface mostly; that his conclusions, unreasonable, partial, hastyas they might at first be, gravitated irresistibly towards the right:in virtue of which grand quality indeed, the root of all good insightin man, his _Times_ oratory found acceptance and influential audience,amid the loud whirl of an England itself logically very stupid, andwise chiefly by instinct.England listened to this voice, as all might observe; and to one whoknew England and it, the result was not quite a strange one, and washonorable rather than otherwise to both parties.  A good judge ofmen's talents has been heard to say of Edward Sterling:  "There is nota _faculty of improvising_ equal to this in all my circle.  Sterlingrushes out into the clubs, into London society, rolls about all day,copiously talking modish nonsense or sense, and listening to the like,with the multifarious miscellany of men; comes home at night; redactsit into a _Times_ Leader,--and is found to have hit the essentialpurport of the world's immeasurable babblement that day, with anaccuracy beyond all other men.  This is what the multifarious Babelsound did mean to say in clear words; this, more nearly than anythingelse.  Let the most gifted intellect, capable of writing epics, try towrite such a Leader for the Morning Newspapers!  No intellect butEdward Sterling's can do it.  An improvising faculty without parallelin my experience."--In this "improvising faculty," much more noblydeveloped, as well as in other faculties and qualities withunexpectedly new and improved figure, John Sterling, to the accurateobserver, showed himself very much the son of Edward.Connected with this matter, a remarkable Note has come into my hands;honorable to the man I am writing of, and in some sort to anotherhigher man; which, as it may now (unhappily for us all) be publishedwithout scruple, I will not withhold here.  The support, by EdwardSterling and the _Times_, of Sir Robert Peel's first Ministry, andgenerally of Peel's statesmanship, was a conspicuous fact in its day;but the return it met with from the person chiefly interested may beconsidered well worth recording.  The following Letter, aftermeandering through I know not what intricate conduits, andconsultations of the Mysterious Entity whose address it bore, came toEdward Sterling as the real flesh-and-blood proprietor, and has beenfound among his papers.  It is marked _Private_:--               "(Private) _To the Editor of the Times_.                                         "WHITEHALL, 18th April, 1835."SIR,--Having this day delivered into the hands of the King the Sealsof Office, I can, without any imputation of an interested motive, orany impediment from scrupulous feelings of delicacy, express my deepsense of the powerful support which that Government over which I hadthe honor to preside received from the _Times_ Newspaper."If I do not offer the expressions of personal gratitude, it isbecause I feel that such expressions would do injustice to thecharacter of a support which was given exclusively on the highest andmost independent grounds of public principle.  I can say this withperfect truth, as I am addressing one whose person even is unknown tome, and who during my tenure of power studiously avoided every speciesof intercourse which could throw a suspicion upon the motives by whichhe was actuated.  I should, however, be doing injustice to my ownfeelings, if I were to retire from Office without one word ofacknowledgment; without at least assuring you of the admiration withwhich I witnessed, during the arduous contest in which I was engaged,the daily exhibition of that extraordinary ability to which I wasindebted for a support, the more valuable because it was an impartialand discriminating support.--I have the honor to be, Sir,            "Ever your most obedient and faithful servant,                                                        "ROBERT PEEL."To which, with due loftiness and diplomatic gravity and brevity, thereis Answer, Draught of Answer in Edward Sterling's hand, from theMysterious Entity so honored, in the following terms:--       "_To the Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel, Bart., &c. &c. &c_."SIR,--It gives me sincere satisfaction to learn from the Letter withwhich you have honored me, bearing yesterday's date, that you estimateso highly the efforts which have been made during the last five monthsby the _Times_ Newspaper to support the cause of rational andwholesome Government which his Majesty had intrusted to your guidance;and that you appreciate fairly the disinterested motive, of regard tothe public welfare, and to that alone, through which this Journal hasbeen prompted to pursue a policy in accordance with that of yourAdministration.  It is, permit me to say, by such motives only, thatthe _Times_, ever since I have known it, has been influenced, whetherin defence of the Government of the day, or in constitutionalresistance to it:  and indeed there exist no other motives of actionfor a Journalist, compatible either with the safety of the press, orwith the political morality of the great bulk of its readers.--Withmuch respect, I have the honor to be, Sir, &c. &c. &c.                                          "THE EDITOR OF THE 'TIMES.'"Of this Note I do not think there was the least whisper during EdwardSterling's lifetime; which fact also one likes to remember of him, soostentatious and little-reticent a man.  For the rest, his loyaladmiration of Sir Robert Peel,--sanctioned, and as it were almostconsecrated to his mind, by the great example of the Duke ofWellington, whom he reverenced always with true hero-worship,--was nota journalistic one, but a most intimate authentic feeling,sufficiently apparent in the very heart of his mind.  Among the manyopinions "liable to three hundred and sixty-five changes in the courseof the year," this in reference to Peel and Wellington was one whichever changed, but was the same all days and hours.  To which, equallygenuine, and coming still oftener to light in those times, there mightone other be added, one and hardly more:  fixed contempt, notunmingled with detestation, for Daniel O'Connell.  This latterfeeling, we used often laughingly to say, was his grand politicalprinciple, the one firm centre where all else went revolving.  Butinternally the other also was deep and constant; and indeed these wereproperly his _two_ centres,--poles of the same axis, negative andpositive, the one presupposing the other.O'Connell he had known in young Dublin days;--and surely no man couldwell venerate another less!  It was his deliberate, unalterableopinion of the then Great O, that good would never come of him; thatonly mischief, and this in huge measure, would come.  That howevershowy, and adroit in rhetoric and management, he was a man ofincurably commonplace intellect, and of no character but a hollow,blustery, pusillanimous and unsound one; great only in maudlinpatriotisms, in speciosities, astucities,--in the miserable gifts forbecoming Chief _Demagogos_, Leader of a deep-sunk Populace towards_its_ Lands of Promise; which trade, in any age or country, andespecially in the Ireland of this age, our indignant friend regarded(and with reason) as an extremely ugly one for a man.  He had himselfzealously advocated Catholic Emancipation, and was not without hisIrish patriotism, very different from the Orange sort; but the"Liberator" was not admirable to him, and grew daily less so to anextreme degree.  Truly, his scorn of the said Liberator, now riding insupreme dominion on the wings of _blarney_, devil-ward of a surety,with the Liberated all following and huzzaing; his fierce gusts ofwrath and abhorrence over him,--rose occasionally almost to thesublime.  We laughed often at these vehemences:--and they were notwholly laughable; there was something very serious, and very true, inthem!  This creed of Edward Sterling's would not now, in either poleof its axis, look so strange as it then did in many quarters.During those ten years which might be defined as the culminatingperiod of Edward Sterling's life, his house at South Place, Knightsbridge, had worn a gay and solid aspect, as if built at last on thehigh table-land of sunshine and success, the region of storms and darkweather now all victoriously traversed and lying safe below.  Health,work, wages, whatever is needful to a man, he had, in rich measure;and a frank stout heart to guide the same:  he lived in such style aspleased him; drove his own chariot up and down (himself often actingas Jehu, and reminding you a little of _Times_ thunder even indriving); consorted, after a fashion, with the powerful of the world;saw in due vicissitude a miscellany of social faces roundhim,--pleasant parties, which he liked well enough to garnish by alord; "Irish lord, if no better might be," as the banter went.  Forthe rest, he loved men of worth and intellect, and recognized themwell, whatever their title:  this was his own patent of worth whichNature had given him; a central light in the man, which illuminatedinto a kind of beauty, serious or humorous, all the artificialities hehad accumulated on the surface of him.  So rolled his days, notquietly, yet prosperously, in manifold commerce with men.  At one inthe morning, when all had vanished into sleep, his lamp was kindled inhis library; and there, twice or thrice a week, for a three-hours'space, he launched his bolts, which next morning were to shake thehigh places of the world.John's relation to his Father, when one saw John here, was altogetherfrank, joyful and amiable:  he ignored the _Times_ thunder for mostpart, coldly taking the Anonymous for non-extant; spoke of itfloutingly, if he spoke at all:  indeed a pleasant half-banteringdialect was the common one between Father and Son; and they,especially with the gentle, simple-hearted, just-minded Mother fortreble-voice between them, made a very pretty glee-harmony together.So had it lasted, ever since poor John's voyagings began; his Father'shouse standing always as a fixed sunny islet with safe harbor for him.So it could not always last.  This sunny islet was now also to breakand go down:  so many firm islets, fixed pillars in his fluctuatingworld, pillar after pillar, were to break and go down; till swiftlyall, so to speak, were sunk in the dark waters, and he with them!  Ourlittle History is now hastening to a close.In the beginning of 1843 news reached us that Sterling had, in his tooreckless way, encountered a dangerous accident:  maids, in the roomwhere he was, were lifting a heavy table; he, seeing them indifficulty, had snatched at the burden; heaved it away,--but hadbroken a blood-vessel by the business; and was now, after extensivehemorrhage, lying dangerously ill.  The doctors hoped the worst wasover; but the case was evidently serious.  In the same days, too, hisMother had been seized here by some painful disease, which from itscontinuance grew alarming.  Sad omens for Edward Sterling, who by thistime had as good as ceased writing or working in the _Times_, havingcomfortably winded up his affairs there; and was looking forward to afreer idle life befitting his advanced years henceforth.  Fataleclipse had fallen over that household of his; never to be lifted offagain till all darkened into night.By dint of watchful nursing, John Sterling got on foot once more:  buthis Mother did not recover, quite the contrary.  Her case too grewvery questionable.  Disease of the heart, said the medical men atlast; not immediately, not perhaps for a length of years, dangerous tolife, said they; but without hope of cure.  The poor lady sufferedmuch; and, though affecting hope always, grew weaker and weaker.  Johnran up to Town in March; I saw him, on the morrow or next day after,in his own room at Knightsbridge:  he had caught fresh cold overnight,the servant having left his window up, but I was charged to saynothing of it, not to flutter the already troubled house:  he wasgoing home again that very day, and nothing ill would come of it.  Weunderstood the family at Falmouth, his Wife being now near herconfinement again, could at any rate comport with no long absence.  Hewas cheerful, even rudely merry; himself pale and ill, his poorMother's cough audible occasionally through the wall.  Very kind, too,and gracefully affectionate; but I observed a certain grimness in hismood of mind, and under his light laughter lay something unusual,something stern, as if already dimmed in the coming shadows of Fate."Yes, yes, you are a good man:  but I understand they mean to appointyou to Rhadamanthus's post, which has been vacant for some time; andyou will see how you like that!"  This was one of the things he said;a strange effulgence of wild drollery flashing through the ice ofearnest pain and sorrow.  He looked paler than usual:  almost for thefirst time, I had myself a twinge of misgiving as to his own health;for hitherto I had been used to blame as much as pity his fits ofdangerous illness, and would often angrily remonstrate with him thathe might have excellent health, would he but take reasonable care ofhimself, and learn the art of sitting still.  Alas, as if he _could_learn it; as if Nature had not laid her ban on him even there, andsaid in smiles and frowns manifoldly, "No, that thou shalt not learn!"He went that day; he never saw his good true Mother more.  Veryshortly afterwards, in spite of doctors' prophecies, and affectionateillusions, she grew alarmingly and soon hopelessly worse.  Here arehis last two Letters to her:--              "_To Mrs. Sterling, Knightsbridge, London_.                                            "FALMOUTH 8th April, 1843."DEAREST MOTHER,--I could do you no good, but it would be the greatestcomfort to me if I could be near you.  Nothing would detain me butSusan's condition.  I feel that until her confinement is over, I oughtto remain here,--unless you wished me to go to you; in which case shewould be the first to send me off.  Happily she is doing as well aspossible, and seems even to gain strength every day.  She sends herlove to you."The children are all doing well.  I rode with Edward to-day throughsome of the pleasant lanes in the neighborhood; and was delighted, asI have often been at the same season, to see the primroses under everyhedge.  It is pleasant to think that the Maker of them can make otherflowers for the gardens of his other mansions.  We have here asoftness in the air, a smoothness of the clouds, and a mild sunshine,that combine in lovely peace with the first green of spring and themellow whiteness of the sails upon the quiet sea.  The whole aspect ofthe world is full of a quiet harmony, that influences even one'sbodily frame, and seems to make one's very limbs aware of somethingliving, good and immortal in all around us.  Knowing how you suffer,and how weak you are, anything is a blessing to me that helps me torise out of confusion and grief into the sense of God and joy.  Icould not indeed but feel how much happier I should have been, thismorning, had you been with me, and delighting as you would have donein all the little as well as the large beauty of the world.  But itwas still a satisfaction to feel how much I owe to you of the power ofperceiving meaning, reality and sweetness in all healthful life.  Andthus I could fancy that you were still near me; and that I could seeyou, as I have so often seen you, looking with earnest eyes at waysideflowers."I would rather not have written what must recall your thoughts toyour present sufferings:  but, dear Mother, I wrote only what I felt;and perhaps you would rather have it so, than that I should try tofind other topics.  I still hope to be with you before long.Meanwhile and always, God bless you, is the prayer of                        "Your affectionate son,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."                            _To the same_.                                          "FALMOUTH, 12th April, 1843."DEAREST MOTHER,--I have just received my Father's Letter; which givesme at least the comfort of believing that you do not suffer very muchpain.  That your mind has remained so clear and strong, is an infiniteblessing."I do not know anything in the world that would make up to me at allfor wanting the recollection of the days I spent with you lately, whenI was amazed at the freshness and life of all your thoughts.  Itbrought back far-distant years, in the strangest, most peaceful way.I felt myself walking with you in Greenwich Park, and on the seashoreat Sandgate; almost even I seemed a baby, with you bending over me.Dear Mother, there is surely something uniting us that cannot perish.I seem so sure of a love which shall last and reunite us, that eventhe remembrance, painful as that is, of all my own follies and illtempers, cannot shake this faith.  When I think of you, and know howyou feel towards me, and have felt for every moment of almost fortyyears, it would be too dark to believe that we shall never meet again.It was from you that I first learnt to think, to feel, to imagine, tobelieve; and these powers, which cannot be extinguished, will one dayenter anew into communion with you.  I have bought it very dear by theprospect of losing you in this world,--but since you have been so ill,everything has seemed to me holier, loftier and more lasting, morefull of hope and final joy."It would be a very great happiness to see you once more even here;but I do not know if that will be granted to me.  But for Susan'sstate, I should not hesitate an instant; as it is, my duty seems to beto remain, and I have no right to repine.  There is no sacrifice thatshe would not make for me, and it would be too cruel to endanger herby mere anxiety on my account.  Nothing can exceed her sympathy withmy sorrow.  But she cannot know, no one can, the recollections of allyou have been and done for me; which now are the most sacred anddeepest, as well as most beautiful, thoughts that abide with me.  MayGod bless you, dearest Mother.  It is much to believe that He feelsfor you all that you have ever felt for your children.                                                      "JOHN STERLING."A day or two after this, "on Good Friday, 1843," his Wife got happilythrough her confinement, bringing him, he writes, "a stout littlegirl, who and the Mother are doing as well as possible."  The littlegirl still lives and does well; but for the Mother there was anotherlot.  Till the Monday following she too did altogether well, heaffectionately watching her; but in the course of that day, somechange for the worse was noticed, though nothing to alarm either thedoctors or him; he watched by her bedside all night, still withoutalarm; but sent again in the morning, Tuesday morning, for thedoctors,--Who did not seem able to make much of the symptoms.  Sheappeared weak and low, but made no particular complaint.  The Londonpost meanwhile was announced; Sterling went into another room to learnwhat tidings of his Mother it brought him.  Returning speedily with aface which in vain strove to be calm, his Wife asked, How atKnightsbridge?  "My Mother is dead," answered Sterling; "died onSunday:  She is gone."  "Poor old man! " murmured the other, thinkingof old Edward Sterling now left alone in the world; and these were herown last words:  in two hours more she too was dead.  In two hoursMother and Wife were suddenly both snatched away from him."It came with awful suddenness! " writes he to his Clifton friend."Still for a short time I had my Susan:  but I soon saw that themedical men were in terror; and almost within half an hour of thatfatal Knightsbridge news, I began to suspect our own pressing danger.I received her last breath upon my lips.  Her mind was much sunk, andher perceptions slow; but a few minutes before the last, she must havecaught the idea of dissolution; and signed that I should kiss her.She faltered painfully, 'Yes! yes!'--returned with fervency thepressure of my lips; and in a few moments her eyes began to fix, herpulse to cease.  She too is gone from me!"  It was Tuesday morning,April 18th, 1843.  His Mother had died on the Sunday before.He had loved his excellent kind Mother, as he ought and well might:in that good heart, in all the wanderings of his own, there had everbeen a shrine of warm pity, of mother's love and blessed softaffections for him; and now it was closed in the Eternitiesforevermore.  His poor Life-partner too, his other self, who hadfaithfully attended him so long in all his pilgrimings, cheerilyfooting the heavy tortuous ways along with him, can follow him nofarther; sinks now at his side:  "The rest of your pilgrimings alone,O Friend,--adieu, adieu!"  She too is forever hidden from his eyes;and he stands, on the sudden, very solitary amid the tumult of fallenand falling things.  "My little baby girl is doing well; poor littlewreck cast upon the sea-beach of life.  My children require me tenfoldnow.  What I shall do, is all confusion and darkness."The younger Mrs. Sterling was a true good woman; loyal-hearted,willing to do well, and struggling wonderfully to do it amid herlanguors and infirmities; rescuing, in many ways, with beautifulfemale heroism and adroitness, what of fertility their uncertain,wandering, unfertile way of life still left possible, and cheerilymaking the most of it.  A genial, pious and harmonious fund ofcharacter was in her; and withal an indolent, half-unconscious forceof intellect, and justness and delicacy of perception, which thecasual acquaintance scarcely gave her credit for.  Sterling muchrespected her decision in matters literary; often altering andmodifying where her feeling clearly went against him; and in versesespecially trusting to her ear, which was excellent, while he knew hisown to be worth little.  I remember her melodious rich plaintive toneof voice; and an exceedingly bright smile which she sometimes had,effulgent with sunny gayety and true humor, among other finequalities.Sterling has lost much in these two hours; how much that has long beencan never again be for him!  Twice in one morning, so to speak, has amighty wind smitten the corners of his house; and much lies in dismalruins round him.CHAPTER VI.VENTNOR:  DEATH.In this sudden avalanche of sorrows Sterling, weak and worn as we haveseen, bore up manfully, and with pious valor fronted what had comeupon him.  He was not a man to yield to vain wailings, or makerepinings at the unalterable:  here was enough to be long mournedover; but here, for the moment, was very much imperatively requiringto be done.  That evening, he called his children round him; spokewords of religious admonition and affection to them; said, "He mustnow be a Mother as well as Father to them."  On the evening of thefuneral, writes Mr. Hare, he bade them good-night, adding these words,"If I am taken from you, God will take care of you."  He had sixchildren left to his charge, two of them infants; and a dark outlookahead of them and him.  The good Mrs. Maurice, the children's youngAunt, present at this time and often afterwards till all ended, was agreat consolation.Falmouth, it may be supposed, had grown a sorrowful place to him,peopled with haggard memories in his weak state; and now again, as hadbeen usual with him, change of place suggested itself as a desirablealleviation;--and indeed, in some sort, as a necessity.  He has"friends here," he admits to himself, "whose kindness is beyond allprice, all description;" but his little children, if anything befellhim, have no relative within two hundred miles.  He is now solewatcher over them; and his very life is so precarious; nay, at anyrate, it would appear, he has to leave Falmouth every spring, or runthe hazard of worse.  Once more, what is to be done?  Once more,--andnow, as it turned out, for the last time.A still gentler climate, greater proximity to London, where hisBrother Anthony now was and most of his friends and interests were:these considerations recommended Ventnor, in the beautifulSoutheastern corner of the Isle of Wight; where on inquiry an eligiblehouse was found for sale.  The house and its surrounding piece ofground, improvable both, were purchased; he removed thither in June ofthis year 1843; and set about improvements and adjustments on a frankscale.  By the decease of his Mother, he had become rich in money; hisshare of the West-India properties having now fallen to him, which,added to his former incomings, made a revenue he could consider ampleand abundant.  Falmouth friends looked lovingly towards him, promisingoccasional visits; old Herstmonceux, which he often spoke ofrevisiting but never did, was not far off; and London, with all itsresources and remembrances, was now again accessible.  He resumed hiswork; and had hopes of again achieving something.The Poem of _Coeur-de-Lion_ has been already mentioned, and the widerform and aim it had got since he first took it in hand.  It was abovea year before the date of these tragedies and changes, that he hadsent me a Canto, or couple of Cantos, of _Coeur-de-Lion_; loyallyagain demanding my opinion, harsh as it had often been on that side.This time I felt right glad to answer in another tone:  "That here wasreal felicity and ingenuity, on the prescribed conditions; adecisively rhythmic quality in this composition; thought andphraseology actually _dancing_, after a sort.  What the plan and scopeof the Work might be, he had not said, and I could not judge; but herewas a light opulence of airy fancy, picturesque conception, vigorousdelineation, all marching on as with cheerful drum and fife, ifwithout more rich and complicated forms of melody:  if a man _would_write in metre, this sure enough was the way to try doing it."  Forsuch encouragement from that stinted quarter, Sterling, I doubt not,was very thankful; and of course it might co-operate with theinspirations from his Naples Tour to further him a little in this hisnow chief task in the way of Poetry; a thought which, among my manyalmost pathetic remembrances of contradictions to his Poetic tendency,is pleasant for me.But, on the whole, it was no matter.  With or without encouragement,he was resolute to persevere in Poetry, and did persevere.  When Ithink now of his modest, quiet steadfastness in this business ofPoetry; how, in spite of friend and foe, he silently persisted,without wavering, in the form of utterance he had chosen for himself;and to what length he carried it, and vindicated himself against usall;--his character comes out in a new light to me, with more of acertain central inflexibility and noble silent resolution than I hadelsewhere noticed in it.  This summer, moved by natural feelings,which were sanctioned, too, and in a sort sanctified to him, by theremembered counsel of his late Wife, he printed the _Tragedy ofStrafford_.  But there was in the public no contradiction to the hardvote I had given about it:  the little Book fell dead-born; andSterling had again to take his disappointment;--which it must be ownedhe cheerfully did; and, resolute to try it again and ever again, wentalong with his _Coeur-de-Lion_, as if the public had been all withhim.  An honorable capacity to stand single against the whole world;such as all men need, from time to time!  After all, who knowswhether, in his overclouded, broken, flighty way of life, incapable oflong hard drudgery, and so shut out from the solid forms of Prose,this Poetic Form, which he could well learn as he could all forms, wasnot the suitablest for him?This work of _Coeur-de-Lion_ he prosecuted steadfastly in his newhome; and indeed employed on it henceforth all the available days thatwere left him in this world.  As was already said, he did not live tocomplete it; but some eight Cantos, three or four of which I know topossess high worth, were finished, before Death intervened, and therehe had to leave it.  Perhaps it will yet be given to the public; andin that case be better received than the others were, by men ofjudgment; and serve to put Sterling's Poetic pretensions on a muchtruer footing.  I can say, that to readers who do prefer a poeticdiet, this ought to be welcome:  if you can contrive to love the thingwhich is still called "poetry" in these days, here is a decidedlysuperior article in that kind,--richer than one of a hundred that yousmilingly consume.In this same month of June, 1843, while the house at Ventnor wasgetting ready, Sterling was again in London for a few days.  Of courseat Knightsbridge, now fallen under such sad change, many privatematters needed to be settled by his Father and Brother and him.Captain Anthony, now minded to remove with his family to London andquit the military way of life, had agreed to purchase the big familyhouse, which he still occupies; the old man, now rid of thatencumbrance, retired to a smaller establishment of his own; cameultimately to be Anthony's guest, and spent his last days so.  He wasmuch lamed and broken, the half of his old life suddenly tornaway;--and other losses, which he yet knew not of, lay close ahead ofhim.  In a year or two, the rugged old man, borne down by thesepressures, quite gave way; sank into paralytic and other infirmities;and was released from life's sorrows, under his son Anthony's roof, inthe fall of 1847.--The house in Knightsbridge was, at the time we nowspeak of, empty except of servants; Anthony having returned to Dublin,I suppose to conclude his affairs there, prior to removal.  Johnlodged in a Hotel.We had our fair share of his company in this visit, as in all the pastones; but the intercourse, I recollect, was dim and broken, adisastrous shadow hanging over it, not to be cleared away by effort.Two American gentlemen, acquaintances also of mine, had beenrecommended to him, by Emerson most likely:  one morning Sterlingappeared here with a strenuous proposal that we should come toKnightsbridge, and dine with him and them.  Objections, generaldissuasions were not wanting:  The empty dark house, such needlesstrouble, and the like;--but he answered in his quizzing way, "Natureherself prompts you, when a stranger comes, to give him a dinner.There are servants yonder; it is all easy; come; both of you are boundto come."  And accordingly we went.  I remember it as one of thesaddest dinners; though Sterling talked copiously, and our friends,Theodore Parker one of them, were pleasant and distinguished men.  Allwas so haggard in one's memory, and half consciously in one'santicipations; sad, as if one had been dining in a will, in the cryptof a mausoleum.  Our conversation was waste and logical, I forgetquite on what, not joyful and harmoniously effusive:  Sterling'ssilent sadness was painfully apparent through the bright mask he hadbound himself to wear.  Withal one could notice now, as on his lastvisit, a certain sternness of mood, unknown in better days; as ifstrange gorgon-faces of earnest Destiny were more and more risinground him, and the time for sport were past.  He looked alwayshurried, abrupt, even beyond wont; and indeed was, I suppose,overwhelmed in details of business.One evening, I remember, he came down hither, designing to have afreer talk with us.  We were all sad enough; and strove rather toavoid speaking of what might make us sadder.  Before any true talk hadbeen got into, an interruption occurred, some unwelcome arrival;Sterling abruptly rose; gave me the signal to rise; and we unpolitelywalked away, adjourning to his Hotel, which I recollect was in theStrand, near Hungerford Market; some ancient comfortablequaint-looking place, off the street; where, in a good warm queer oldroom, the remainder of our colloquy was duly finished.  We spoke ofCromwell, among other things which I have now forgotten; on whichsubject Sterling was trenchant, positive, and in some essential pointswrong,--as I said I would convince him some day.  "Well, well!"answered he, with a shake of the head.--We parted before long; bedtimefor invalids being come:  he escorted me down certain carpetedbackstairs, and would not be forbidden:  we took leave under the dimskies;--and alas, little as I then dreamt of it, this, so far as I cancalculate, must have been the last time I ever saw him in the world.Softly as a common evening, the last of the evenings had passed away,and no other would come for me forevermore.Through the summer he was occupied with fitting up his new residence,selecting governesses, servants; earnestly endeavoring to set hishouse in order, on the new footing it had now assumed.  Extensiveimprovements in his garden and grounds, in which he took due interestto the last, were also going on.  His Brother, and Mr. Maurice hisbrother-in-law,--especially Mrs. Maurice the kind sister, faithfullyendeavoring to be as a mother to her poor little nieces,--wereoccasionally with him.  All hours available for labor on his literarytasks, he employed, almost exclusively I believe, on _Coeur-de-Lion_;with what energy, the progress he had made in that Work, and in theart of Poetic composition generally, amid so many sore impediments,best testifies.  I perceive, his life in general lay heavier on himthan it had done before; his mood of mind is grown moresombre;--indeed the very solitude of this Ventnor as a place, not tospeak of other solitudes, must have been new and depressing.  But headmits no hypochondria, now or ever; occasionally, though rarely, evenflashes of a kind of wild gayety break through.  He works steadily athis task, with all the strength left him; endures the past as he may,and makes gallant front against the world.  "I am going on quietlyhere, rather than happily," writes he to his friend Newman; "sometimesquite helpless, not from distinct illness, but from sad thoughts and aghastly dreaminess.  The heart is gone out of my life.  My children,however, are doing well; and the place is cheerful and mild."From Letters of this period I might select some melancholy enough; butwill prefer to give the following one (nearly the last I can give), asindicative of a less usual temper:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                                         "VENTNOR, 7th December, 1843."MY DEAR CARLYLE,--My Irish Newspaper was _not_ meant as a hint that Iwanted a Letter.  It contained an absurd long Advertisement,--someproject for regenerating human knowledge, &c. &c.; to which I prefixedmy private mark (a blot), thinking that you might be pleased to knowof a fellow-laborer somewhere in Tipperary."Your Letter, like the Scriptural oil,--(they had no patent lampsthen, and used the best oil, 7s. per gallon),--has made my face toshine.  There is but one person in the world, I shall not tell youwho, from whom a Letter would give me so much pleasure.  It would benearly as good at Pekin, in the centre of the most enlightenedMandarins; but here at Ventnor, where there are few Mandarins and noenlightenment,--fountains in the wilderness, even were theymiraculous, are nothing compared with your handwriting.  Yet it is sadthat you should be so melancholy.  I often think that though Mercurywas the pleasanter fellow, and probably the happier, Saturn was thegreater god;--rather cannibal or so, but one excuses it in him, as insome other heroes one knows of."It is, as you say, your destiny to write about Cromwell:  and youwill make a book of him, at which the ears of our grandchildren willtingle;--and as one may hope that the ears of human nature will begrowing longer and longer, the tingling will be proportionatelygreater than we are accustomed to.  Do what you can, I fear there willbe little gain from the Royalists.  There is something very smallabout the biggest of them that I have ever fallen in with, unless youcount old Hobbes a Royalist."Curious to see that you have them exactly preserved in the CountryGentlemen of our day; while of the Puritans not a trace remains exceptin History.  Squirism had already, in that day, become the _caputmortuum_ that it is now; and has therefore, like other mummies, beenable to last.  What was opposed to it was the Life ofPuritanism,--then on the point of disappearing; and it too has leftits mummy at Exeter Hall on the platform and elsewhere.  One must goback to the Middle Ages to see Squirism as rampant and vivacious asBiblicism was in the Seventeenth Century:  and I suppose our modernCountry Gentlemen are about as near to what the old Knights and Baronswere who fought the Crusades, as our modern Evangelicals to thefellows who sought the Lord by the light of their own pistol-shots."Those same Crusades are now pleasant matter for me.  You remember, orperhaps you do not, a thing I once sent you about Coeur-de-Lion.  Longsince, I settled to make the Cantos you saw part of a larger Book; andworked at it, last autumn and winter, till I had a bad illness.  I amnow at work on it again; and go full sail, like _my_ hero.  There aresix Cantos done, roughly, besides what you saw.  I have struck outmost of the absurdest couplets, and given the whole a higher thoughstill sportive tone.  It is becoming a kind of _Odyssey_, with alaughing and Christian Achilles for hero.  One may manage to wrap, inthat chivalrous brocade, many things belonging to our Time, andcapable of interesting it.  The thing is not bad; but will requiregreat labor.  Only it is labor that I thoroughly like; and which keepsthe maggots out of one's brain, until their time."I have never spoken to you, never been able to speak to you, of thechange in my life,--almost as great, one fancies, as one's own death.Even now, although it seems as if I had so much to say, I cannot.  Ifone could imagine--...  But it is no use; I cannot write wisely onthis matter.  I suppose no human being was ever devoted to anothermore entirely than she; and that makes the change not less but morebearable.  It seems as if she could not be gone quite; and that indeedis my faith."Mr. James, your New-England friend, was here only for a few days; Isaw him several times, and liked him.  They went, on the 24th of lastmonth, back to London,--or so purposed,--because there is no pavementhere for him to walk on.  I want to know where he is, and thought Ishould be able to learn from you.  I gave him a Note for Mill, whoperhaps may have seen him.  I think this is all at present from,                                "Yours,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."Of his health, all this while, we had heard little definite; andunderstood that he was very quiet and careful; in virtue of whichgrand improvement we vaguely considered all others would follow.  Oncelet him learn well to be _slow_ as the common run of men are, wouldnot all be safe and well?  Nor through the winter, or the cold springmonths, did bad news reach us; perhaps less news of any kind than hadbeen usual, which seemed to indicate a still and wholesome way of lifeand work.  Not till "April 4th, 1844," did the new alarm occur:  againon some slight accident, the breaking of a blood-vessel; againprostration under dangerous sickness, from which this time he neverrose.There had been so many sudden failings and happy risings again in ourpoor Sterling's late course of health, we had grown so accustomed tomingle blame of his impetuosity with pity for his sad overthrows, wedid not for many weeks quite realize to ourselves the stern fact thathere at length had the peculiar fall come upon us,--the last of allthese falls!  This brittle life, which had so often held together andvictoriously rallied under pressures and collisions, could not rallyalways, and must one time be shivered.  It was not till the summercame and no improvement; and not even then without lingering glimmersof hope against hope, that I fairly had to own what had now come, whatwas now day by day sternly advancing with the steadiness of Time.From the first, the doctors spoke despondently; and Sterling himselffelt well that there was no longer any chance of life.  He had oftensaid so, in his former illnesses, and thought so, yet always till nowwith some tacit grain of counter-hope; he had never clearly felt so asnow:  Here _is_ the end; the great change is now here!--Seeing how itwas, then, he earnestly gathered all his strength to do this last actof his tragedy, as he had striven to do the others, in a pious andmanful manner.  As I believe we can say he did; few men in any time_more_ piously or manfully.  For about six months he sat lookingsteadfastly, at all moments, into the eyes of Death; he too who hadeyes to _see_ Death and the Terrors and Eternities; and surely it waswith perfect courage and piety, and valiant simplicity of heart, thathe bore himself, and did and thought and suffered, in this tryingpredicament, more terrible than the usual death of men.  All strengthleft to him he still employed in working:  day by day the end camenearer, but day by day also some new portion of his adjustments wascompleted, by some small stage his task was nearer done.  His domesticand other affairs, of all sorts, he settled to the last item.  Of hisown Papers he saved a few, giving brief pertinent directions aboutthem; great quantities, among which a certain Autobiography begun someyears ago at Clifton, he ruthlessly burnt, judging that the best.  Tohis friends he left messages, memorials of books:  I have a _Gough'sCamden_, and other relics, which came to me in that way, and are amongmy sacred possessions.  The very Letters of his friends he sorted andreturned; had each friend's Letters made into a packet, sealed withblack, and duly addressed for delivery when the time should come.At an early period of his illness, all visitors had of course beenexcluded, except his most intimate ones:  before long, so soon as theend became apparent, he took leave even of his Father, to avoidexcitements and intolerable emotions; and except his Brother and theMaurices, who were generally about him coming and going, none wereadmitted.  This latter form of life, I think, continued for abovethree months.  Men were still working about his grounds, of whom hetook some charge; needful works, great and small, let them not pauseon account of him.  He still rose from bed; had still some portion ofhis day which he could spend in his Library.  Besides business there,he read a good deal,--earnest books; the Bible, most earnest of books,his chief favorite.  He still even wrote a good deal.  To his eldestBoy, now Mr. Newman's ward, who had been removed to the Maurices'since the beginning of this illness, he addressed, every day or two,sometimes daily, for eight or nine weeks, a Letter, of generalpaternal advice and exhortation; interspersing sparingly, now andthen, such notices of his own feelings and condition as could beaddressed to a boy.  These Letters, I have lately read:  they give,beyond any he has written, a noble image of the intrinsicSterling;--the same face we had long known; but painted now as on theazure of Eternity, serene, victorious, divinely sad; the dusts andextraneous disfigurements imprinted on it by the world, now washedaway.  One little Excerpt, not the best, but the fittest for itsneighborhood here, will be welcome to the reader:--               "_To Master Edward C. Sterling, London_.                                  "HILLSIDE, VENTNOR, 29th June, 1844."MY DEAR BOY,--We have been going on here as quietly as possible, withno event that I know of.  There is nothing except books to occupy me.But you may suppose that my thoughts often move towards you, and thatI fancy what you may be doing in the great City,--the greatest on theEarth,--where I spent so many years of my life.  I first saw Londonwhen I was between eight and nine years old, and then lived in or nearit for the whole of the next ten, and more there than anywhere elsefor seven years longer.  Since then I have hardly ever been a yearwithout seeing the place, and have often lived in it for aconsiderable time.  There I grew from childhood to be a man.  Mylittle Brothers and Sisters, and since, my Mother, died and are buriedthere.  There I first saw your Mamma, and was there married.  It seemsas if, in some strange way, London were a part of Me or I of London.I think of it often, not as full of noise and dust and confusion, butas something silent, grand and everlasting."When I fancy how you are walking in the same streets, and movingalong the same river, that I used to watch so intently, as if in adream, when younger than you are,--I could gladly burst into tears,not of grief, but with a feeling that there is no name for.Everything is so wonderful, great and holy, so sad and yet not bitter,so full of Death and so bordering on Heaven.  Can you understandanything of this?  If you can, you will begin to know what a seriousmatter our Life is; how unworthy and stupid it is to trifle it awaywithout heed; what a wretched, insignificant, worthless creature anyone comes to be, who does not as soon as possible bend his wholestrength, as in stringing a stiff bow, to doing whatever task liesfirst before him...."We have a mist here to-day from the sea.  It reminds me of that whichI used to see from my house in St, Vincent, rolling over the greatvolcano and the mountains round it.  I used to look at it from ourwindows with your Mamma, and you a little baby in her arms."This Letter is not so well written as I could wish, but I hope youwill be able to read it.                       "Your affectionate Papa,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."These Letters go from June 9th to August 2d, at which latter datevacation-time arrived, and the Boy returned to him.  The Letters arepreserved; and surely well worth preserving.In this manner he wore the slow doomed months away.  Day after day hislittle period of Library went on waning, shrinking into less and less;but I think it never altogether ended till the general end came.--Forcourage, for active audacity we had all known Sterling; but such afund of mild stoicism, of devout patience and heroic composure, we didnot hitherto know in him.  His sufferings, his sorrows, all hisunutterabilities in this slow agony, he held right manfully down;marched loyally, as at the bidding of the Eternal, into the dreadKingdoms, and no voice of weakness was heard from him.  Poor nobleSterling, he had struggled so high and gained so little here!  Butthis also he did gain, to be a brave man; and it was much.Summer passed into Autumn:  Sterling's earthly businesses, to the lastdetail of them, were now all as good as done:  his strength too waswearing to its end, his daily turn in the Library shrunk now to aspan.  He had to hold himself as if in readiness for the great voyageat any moment.  One other Letter I must give; not quite the lastmessage I had from Sterling, but the last that can be inserted here:a brief Letter, fit to be forever memorable to the receiver of it:--             "_To Thomas Carlyle, Esq., Chelsea, London_.                                "HILLSIDE, VENTNOR, 10th August, 1844.MY DEAR CARLYLE,--For the first time for many months it seems possibleto send you a few words; merely, however, for Remembrance andFarewell.  On higher matters there is nothing to say.  I tread thecommon road into the great darkness, without any thought of fear, andwith very much of hope.  Certainty indeed I have none.  With regard toYou and Me I cannot begin to write; having nothing for it but to keepshut the lid of those secrets with all the iron weights that are in mypower.  Towards me it is still more true than towards England that noman has been and done like you.  Heaven bless you!  If I can lend ahand when THERE, that will not be wanting.  It is all very strange,but not one hundredth part so sad as it seems to the standers-by."Your Wife knows my mind towards her, and will believe it withoutasseverations.                          "Yours to the last,                                                      "JOHN STERLING."It was a bright Sunday morning when this letter came to me:  if in thegreat Cathedral of Immensity I did no worship that day, the faultsurely was my own.  Sterling affectionately refused to see me; whichalso was kind and wise.  And four days before his death, there aresome stanzas of verse for me, written as if in star-fire and immortaltears; which are among my sacred possessions, to be kept for myselfalone.His business with the world was done; the one business now to awaitsilently what may lie in other grander worlds.  "God is great," he waswont to say:  "God is great."  The Maurices were now constantly nearhim; Mrs. Maurice assiduously watching over him.  On the evening ofWednesday the 18th of September, his Brother, as he did every two orthree days, came down; found him in the old temper, weak in strengthbut not very sensibly weaker; they talked calmly together for an hour;then Anthony left his bedside, and retired for the night, notexpecting any change.  But suddenly, about eleven o'clock, there camea summons and alarm:  hurrying to his Brother's room, he found hisBrother dying; and in a short while more the faint last struggle wasended, and all those struggles and strenuous often-foiled endeavors ofeight-and-thirty years lay hushed in death.CHAPTER VII.CONCLUSION.Sterling was of rather slim but well-boned wiry figure, perhaps aninch or two from six feet in height; of blonde complexion, withoutcolor, yet not pale or sickly; dark-blonde hair, copious enough, whichhe usually wore short.  The general aspect of him indicated freedom,perfect spontaneity, with a certain careless natural grace.  In hisapparel, you could notice, he affected dim colors, easy shapes;cleanly always, yet even in this not fastidious or conspicuous:  hesat or stood, oftenest, in loose sloping postures; walked with longstrides, body carelessly bent, head flung eagerly forward, right handperhaps grasping a cane, and rather by the middle to swing it, than bythe end to use it otherwise.  An attitude of frank, cheerfulimpetuosity, of hopeful speed and alacrity; which indeed hisphysiognomy, on all sides of it, offered as the chief expression.Alacrity, velocity, joyous ardor, dwelt in the eyes too, which were ofbrownish gray, full of bright kindly life, rapid and frank rather thandeep or strong.  A smile, half of kindly impatience, half of realmirth, often sat on his face.  The head was long; high over thevertex; in the brow, of fair breadth, but not high for such a man.In the voice, which was of good tenor sort, rapid and strikinglydistinct, powerful too, and except in some of the higher notesharmonious, there was a clear-ringing _metallic_ tone,--which I oftenthought was wonderfully physiognomic.  A certain splendor, beautiful,but not the deepest or the softest, which I could call a splendor asof burnished metal,--fiery valor of heart, swift decisive insight andutterance, then a turn for brilliant elegance, also for ostentation,rashness, &c. &c.,--in short, a flash as of clear-glancingsharp-cutting steel, lay in the whole nature of the man, in his heartand in his intellect, marking alike the excellence and the limits ofthem both.  His laugh, which on light occasions was ready andfrequent, had in it no great depth of gayety, or sense for theludicrous in men or things; you might call it rather a good smilebecome vocal than a deep real laugh:  with his whole man I never sawhim laugh.  A clear sense of the humorous he had, as of most otherthings; but in himself little or no true humor;--nor did he attemptthat side of things.  To call him deficient in sympathy would seemstrange, him whose radiances and resonances went thrilling over allthe world, and kept him in brotherly contact with all:  but I may sayhis sympathies dwelt rather with the high and sublime than with thelow or ludicrous; and were, in any field, rather light, wide andlively, than deep, abiding or great.There is no Portrait of him which tolerably resembles.  The miniatureMedallion, of which Mr. Hare has given an Engraving, offers us, withno great truth in physical details, one, and not the best, superficialexpression of his face, as if that with vacuity had been what the facecontained; and even that Mr. Hare's engraver has disfigured into thenearly or the utterly irrecognizable.  Two Pencil-sketches, which noartist could approve of, hasty sketches done in some social hour, oneby his friend Spedding, one by Banim the Novelist, whom he slightlyknew and had been kind to, tell a much truer story so far as they go:of these his Brother has engravings; but these also I must suppress asinadequate for strangers.Nor in the way of Spiritual Portraiture does there, after so muchwriting and excerpting, anything of importance remain for me to say.John Sterling and his Life in this world were--such as has beenalready said.  In purity of character, in the so-called moralities, inall manner of proprieties of conduct, so as tea-tables and other humantribunals rule them, he might be defined as perfect, according to theworld's pattern:  in these outward tangible respects the world'scriticism of him must have been praise and that only.  An honorableman, and good citizen; discharging, with unblamable correctness, allfunctions and duties laid on him by the customs (_mores_) of thesociety he lived in,--with correctness and something more.  In allthese particulars, a man perfectly _moral_, or of approved virtueaccording to the rules.Nay in the far more essential tacit virtues, which are not marked onstone tables, or so apt to be insisted on by human creatures over teaor elsewhere,--in clear and perfect fidelity to Truth wherever found,in childlike and soldier-like, pious and valiant loyalty to theHighest, and what of good and evil that might send him,--he excelledamong good men.  The joys and the sorrows of his lot he took with truesimplicity and acquiescence.  Like a true son, not like a miserablemutinous rebel, he comported himself in this Universe.  Extremity ofdistress--and surely his fervid temper had enough of contradiction inthis world--could not tempt him into impatience at any time.  By nochance did you ever hear from him a whisper of those mean repinings,miserable arraignings and questionings of the Eternal Power, such asweak souls even well disposed will sometimes give way to in thepressure of their despair; to the like of this he never yielded, orshowed the least tendency to yield;--which surely was well on hispart.  For the Eternal Power, I still remark, will not answer the likeof this, but silently and terribly accounts it impious, blasphemousand damnable, and now as heretofore will visit it as such.  Not arebel but a son, I said; willing to suffer when Heaven said, Thoushalt;--and withal, what is perhaps rarer in such a combination,willing to rejoice also, and right cheerily taking the good that wassent, whensoever or in whatever form it came.A pious soul we may justly call him; devoutly submissive to the willof the Supreme in all things:  the highest and sole essential formwhich Religion can assume in man, and without which all forms ofreligion are a mockery and a delusion in man.  Doubtless, in so clearand filial a heart there must have dwelt the perennial feeling ofsilent worship; which silent feeling, as we have seen, he was eagerenough to express by all good ways of utterance; zealously adoptingsuch appointed forms and creeds as the dignitaries of the World hadfixed upon and solemnly named recommendable; prostrating his heart insuch Church, by such accredited rituals and seemingly fit or half-fitmethods, as his poor time and country had to offer him,--not rejectingthe said methods till they stood convicted of palpable unfitness andthen doing it right gently withal, rather letting them drop aspitiably dead for him, than angrily hurling them out of doors asneeding to be killed.  By few Englishmen of his epoch had the thingcalled Church of England been more loyally appealed to as a spiritualmother.And yet, as I said before, it may be questioned whether piety, what wecall devotion or worship, was the principle deepest in him.  In spiteof his Coleridge discipleship, and his once headlong operationsfollowing thereon, I used to judge that his piety was prompt and purerather than great or intense; that, on the whole, religious devotionwas not the deepest element of him.  His reverence was ardent andjust, ever ready for the thing or man that deserved revering, orseemed to deserve it:  but he was of too joyful, light and hoping anature to go to the depths of that feeling, much more to dwellperennially in it.  He had no fear in his composition; terror and awedid not blend with his respect of anything.  In no scene or epochcould he have been a Church Saint, a fanatic enthusiast, or have wornout his life in passive martyrdom, sitting patient in his grimcoal-mine, looking at the "three ells" of Heaven high overhead there.In sorrow he would not dwell; all sorrow he swiftly subdued, and shookaway from him.  How could you have made an Indian Fakir of the GreekApollo, "whose bright eye lends brightness, and never yet saw ashadow"?--I should say, not religious reverence, rather artisticadmiration was the essential character of him:  a fact connected withall other facts in the physiognomy of his life and self, and giving atragic enough character to much of the history he had among us.Poor Sterling, he was by nature appointed for a Poet, then,--a Poetafter his sort, or recognizer and delineator of the Beautiful; and notfor a Priest at all?  Striving towards the sunny heights, out of sucha level and through such an element as ours in these days is, he hadstrange aberrations appointed him, and painful wanderings amid themiserable gaslights, bog-fires, dancing meteors and putridphosphorescences which form the guidance of a young human soul atpresent!  Not till after trying all manner of sublimely illuminatedplaces, and finding that the basis of them was putridity, artificialgas and quaking bog, did he, when his strength was all done, discoverhis true sacred hill, and passionately climb thither while life wasfast ebbing!--A tragic history, as all histories are; yet a gallant,brave and noble one, as not many are.  It is what, to a radiant son ofthe Muses, and bright messenger of the harmonious Wisdoms, this poorworld--if he himself have not strength enough, and _inertia_ enough,and amid his harmonious eloquences silence enough--has provided atpresent.  Many a high-striving, too hasty soul, seeking guidancetowards eternal excellence from the official Black-artists, andsuccessful Professors of political, ecclesiastical, philosophical,commercial, general and particular Legerdemain, will recognize his ownhistory in this image of a fellow-pilgrim's.Over-haste was Sterling's continual fault; over-haste, and want of thedue strength,--alas, mere want of the due _inertia_ chiefly; which isso common a gift for most part; and proves so inexorably needfulwithal!  But he was good and generous and true; joyful where there wasjoy, patient and silent where endurance was required of him; shookinnumerable sorrows, and thick-crowding forms of pain, gallantly awayfrom him; fared frankly forward, and with scrupulous care to tread onno one's toes.  True, above all, one may call him; a man of perfectveracity in thought, word and deed.  Integrity towards all men,--nayintegrity had ripened with him into chivalrous generosity; there wasno guile or baseness anywhere found in him.  Transparent as crystal;he could not hide anything sinister, if such there had been to hide.A more perfectly transparent soul I have never known.  It wasbeautiful, to read all those interior movements; the little shades ofaffectations, ostentations; transient spurts of anger, which nevergrew to the length of settled spleen:  all so naive, so childlike, thevery faults grew beautiful to you.And so he played his part among us, and has now ended it:  in thisfirst half of the Nineteenth Century, such was the shape of humandestinies the world and he made out between them.  He sleeps now, inthe little burying-ground of Bonchurch; bright, ever-young in thememory of others that must grow old; and was honorably released fromhis toils before the hottest of the day.All that remains, in palpable shape, of John Sterling's activities inthis world are those Two poor Volumes; scattered fragments gatheredfrom the general waste of forgotten ephemera by the piety of a friend:an inconsiderable memorial; not pretending to have achieved greatness;only disclosing, mournfully, to the more observant, that a promise ofgreatness was there.  Like other such lives, like all lives, this is atragedy; high hopes, noble efforts; under thickening difficulties andimpediments, ever-new nobleness of valiant effort;--and the resultdeath, with conquests by no means corresponding.  A life which cannotchallenge the world's attention; yet which does modestly solicit it,and perhaps on clear study will be found to reward it.On good evidence let the world understand that here was a remarkablesoul born into it; who, more than others, sensible to its influences,took intensely into him such tint and shape of feature as the worldhad to offer there and then; fashioning himself eagerly by whatsoeverof noble presented itself; participating ardently in the world'sbattle, and suffering deeply in its bewilderments;--whoseLife-pilgrimage accordingly is an emblem, unusually significant, ofthe world's own during those years of his.  A man of infinitesusceptivity; who caught everywhere, more than others, the color ofthe element he lived in, the infection of all that was or appearedhonorable, beautiful and manful in the tendencies of his Time;--whosehistory therefore is, beyond others, emblematic of that of his Time.In Sterling's Writings and Actions, were they capable of being wellread, we consider that there is for all true hearts, and especiallyfor young noble seekers, and strivers towards what is highest, amirror in which some shadow of themselves and of their immeasurablycomplex arena will profitably present itself.  Here also is oneencompassed and struggling even as they now are.  This man also hadsaid to himself, not in mere Catechism-words, but with all hisinstincts, and the question thrilled in every nerve of him, and pulsedin every drop of his blood:  "What is the chief end of man?  Behold, Itoo would live and work as beseems a denizen of this Universe, a childof the Highest God.  By what means is a noble life still possible forme here?  Ye Heavens and thou Earth, oh, how?"--The history of thislong-continued prayer and endeavor, lasting in various figures fornear forty years, may now and for some time coming have something tosay to men!Nay, what of men or of the world?  Here, visible to myself, for somewhile, was a brilliant human presence, distinguishable, honorable andlovable amid the dim common populations; among the million littlebeautiful, once more a beautiful human soul:  whom I, among others,recognized and lovingly walked with, while the years and the hourswere.  Sitting now by his tomb in thoughtful mood, the new times bringa new duty for me.  "Why write the Life of Sterling?"  I imagine I hada commission higher than the world's, the dictate of Nature herself,to do what is now done.  _Sic prosit_.NOTES:_______________________________[1] _John Sterling's Essays and Tales, with Life_ by Archdeacon Hare.Parker; London, 1848.[2] _Commons Journals_, iv. 15 (l0th January, 1644-5); and again v.307 &c., 498 (18th September, 1647-15th March, 1647-8).[3] _Literary Chronicle_, New Series; London, Saturday, 21 June, 1828,Art.
