 interesting place.It will be difficult for me to forget--after such a long, wearisome, and inpart desperate journey--our approach to Falaise:--and more especially theappearance of the castle just mentioned. The stone seemed as fresh, and asperfectly cemented, as if it had been the work of the preceding year.Moreover, the contiguous parts were so fine and so thoroughlypicturesque--and the superadded tradition of its being, according to some,the birth place--and according to others, the usual residence--of WILLIAMTHE CONQUEROR ... altogether threw a charm about the first glimpse of thisvenerable pile, which cannot be easily described. I had receivedinstructions to put up at the "_Grand Turc_"--as the only hotel worthy anEnglishman's notice. At the door of the Grand Turk, therefore, we weresafely deposited: after having got rid of our incumbrances of twopostilions, and two hundred weight of refined sugar. Our reception wasgracious in the extreme. The inn appeared "tout-?-fait ? la modeAnglaise"--and no marvel ... for Madame the hostess was an Englishwoman.Her husband's name was _David_.Bespeaking a late cup of tea, I strolled through the principalstreets,--delighted with the remarkably clear current of the water, whichran on each side from the numerous overcharged fountains. Day-light hadwholly declined; when, sitting down to my souchong, I saw, withastonishment--a _pair of sugar-tongs_ and a _salt-spoon_--the first of thekind I had beheld since I left England! Madame David enjoyed my surprise;adding, in a very droll phraseology, that she had "not forgotten goodEnglish customs." Our beds and bed rooms were perfectly comfortable, andeven elegant.The moat which encircles, not only the castle, but the town--and which musthave been once formidable from its depth and breadth, when filled withwater--is now most pleasingly metamorphosed. Pasture lands, kitchengardens, and orchards, occupy it entirely. Here the cattle quietly stray,and luxuriously feed. But the metamorphosis of the _castle_ has been, in anequal degree, unfortunate. The cannon balls, during the wars of theLeague--and the fury of the populace, with the cupidity or caprice ofsome individuals, during the late revolution--helped to produce thischange. After breakfast, I felt a strong desire to survey carefully thescite and structure of the castle. It was a lovely day; and in fiveminutes I obtained admission at a temporary outer gate. The first nearview within the ramparts perfectly enchanted me. The situation is atonce bold, commanding, and picturesque. But as the opposite, andimmediately contiguous ground, is perhaps yet a little higher, it shouldfollow that a force, placed upon such eminence--as indeed was that ofHenry the Fourth, during the wars of the League--would in the end subduethe garrison, or demolish the castle. I walked here and there amidstbriars and brushwood, diversified with lilacs and laburnums; and by theaid of the guide soon got within an old room--of which the outer wallsonly remained--and which is distinguished by being called the_birth-place_ of WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.Between ourselves, the castle appears to be at least a century later thanthe time of William the Conqueror; and certainly the fine round tower, ofwhich such frequent mention has been made, is rather of the fourteenth, ifnot of the beginning of the fifteenth century;[167] but it is a noble pieceof masonry. The stone is of a close grain and beautiful colour, and thecomponent parts are put together with a hard cement, and with the smallestpossible interstices. At the top of it, on the left side, facing the highroad from Vire,--and constructed within the very walls themselves, is a_well_--which goes from the top apparently to the very bottom of thefoundation, quite to the bed of the moat. It is about three feet indiameter, measuring with the eye; perhaps four: but it is doubtless a verycurious piece of workmanship. We viewed with an inquisitive eye whatremained of the _Donjon_: sighed, as we surveyed the ruins of the_chapel_--a very interesting little piece of ecclesiastical antiquity:and shuddered as we contemplated the enormous and ponderousportcullis--which had a _drop of_ full twenty feet ... to keep out theinvading foe. I was in truth delighted with this first reconnoissance ofFALAISE--beneath one of the brightest and bluest skies of Normandy!and--within walls, which were justly considered to be among the mostperfect as well as the most ancient of those in Normandy.Leaving my companion to take a view of the upper part of this venerablebuilding, I retreated towards the town--resolved to leave no church and nostreet unexplored. On descending, and quitting the gate by which I hadentered, a fine, robust, and respectable figure, habited as anEcclesiastic, met and accosted me. I was most prompt to return thesalutation. "We are proud, Sir, of our castle, and I observe you have beenvisiting it. The English ought to take an interest in it, since it was thebirth-place of William the Conqueror." I readily admitted it was well wortha minute examination: but as readily turned the conversation to the subjectof LIBRARIES. The amiable stranger (for he was gaining upon me fast, by hisunaffected manners and sensible remarks) answered, that "their _own_ publiclibrary existed no longer--having been made subservient to theinquisitorial visit of M. Moysant of Caen[168]: that he had himselfprocured for the Bishop of Bayeux the _Mentz Bible_ of 1462--and that theChapter-Library of Bayeux, before the Revolution, could not have containedfewer than 40,000 volumes. "But you are doubtless acquainted, Sir, with theCOMTE DE LA FRESNAYE, who resides in yonder large mansion?"--pointing to ahouse upon an elevated spot on the other side of the town. I replied that Ihad not that honour; and was indeed an utter stranger to every inhabitantof Falaise. I then stated, in as few and precise words as possible, theparticular object of my visit to the Continent. "Cela suffit"--resumed theunknown--"nous irons faire visite ? Monsieur le Comte apr?s le din?; ? cemoment il s'occupe avec le p?tage--car c'est un jour maigre. Il sera charm?de vous recevoir. Il aime infiniment les Anglois, et il a rest? long-tempschez vous. C'est un brave homme--et m?me un grand antiquaire."My pulse and colour increased sensibly as the stranger uttered these latterwords: and he concluded by telling me that he was himself the Cur? of _Ste.Trinit?_ one of the two principal churches of the town--and that his namewas MOUTON. Be assured that I shall not lose sight of the Comte de laFresnaye, and Monsieur Mouton.[166] [Only ONE letter has passed between us since my departure; and that    enables me to subjoin a fac-simile of its author's autograph.    [Autograph: de Larenaudiere][167] [It was in fact built by the famous Lord Talbot, about the year 1420.    A similar castle, but less strong and lofty, may be seen at Castor,    near Yarmouth in Norfolk--once the seat of the famous Sir JOHN    FASTOLF, (a contemporary with Talbot) of whom Anstis treats so fully    in his _Order of the Garter_, vol.i. p.142.][168] See p. 205 ante.LETTER XX.MONS. MOUTON. CHURCH OF STE. TRINIT?. COMTE DE LA FRESNAYE. GUIBRAY CHURCH.SUPPOSED HEAD OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. M. LANGEVIN, HISTORIAN OF FALAISE.PRINTING OFFICES.I lose no time in the fulfilment of my promise. The church of SAINTETRINIT?, of which Monsieur Mouton is the Cur?, is the second place ofworship in rank in the town. During the Revolution, Mons. Mouton wascompelled, with too many of his professional brethren, to fly from thegeneral persecution of his order. One solitary and most amiable creatureonly remained; of the name of LANGEVIN--of whom, by and by, Monsieur Moutondid me the honour of shewing me the interior of his church. His stipend (ashe told me) did not exceed 1500 francs per annum; and it is reallysurprising to observe to what apparent acts of generosity towards hisflock, this income is made subservient. You shall hear. The altar consistsof two angels of the size of life, kneeling very gracefully, in whiteglazed plaister: in the centre, somewhat raised above, is a figure of theVirgin, of the same materials; above which again, is a representation ofthe TRINITY--in a blaze of gilt. The massive circular columns surroundingthe choir--probably of the fourteenth century--were just fresh painted, atthe expense of the worthy Cur?, in alternate colours of blue andyellow--imitative of marble;--that is to say, each column, alternately, wasblue and yellow. It was impossible to behold any thing more glaring andmore tasteless. I paid my little tribute of admiration at the simplicityand grace of the kneeling figure of the Virgin--but was stubbornly silentabout every thing else. Monsieur Mouton replied that "he intended to gracethe brows of the angels by putting a _garland_ round each." I felt a sortof twinge upon receiving this intelligence; but there is no persuading theFrench to reject, or to qualify, their excessive fondness for flowerornaments.Projecting from the wall, behind the circular part of the choir, I observeda figure of _St. Sebastian_--precisely of that character which we remark inthe printed missals of the fifteenth century,--and from which the engraversof that period copied them: namely, with the head large, the body meagre,and the limbs loose and muscular. It was plentifully covered, as was thewhole surface of the wall, with recent white wash. On observing this, myguide added: "oui, et je veux le faire couvrir d'une teinte encore plusblanche!" Here I felt a second twinge yet more powerful than the first. Inoticed, towards the south-side door, a very fine crucifix, cut in wood,about three feet high; and apparently of the time of Goujon. It was by muchthe finest piece of sculpture, of its kind, which I had seen in Normandy;but it was rather in a decaying state. I wished to know whether such anobject of art--apparently of no earthly importance, where it wassituated--might be obtained for some honourable and adequate compensation.Monsieur Mouton replied that he desired to part with it--but that it mustbe replaced by another "full six feet high!" There was no meeting thisproposition, and I ceased to say another word upon the subject.Upon the whole, the church of the Holy Trinity is rather a fine andcapacious, than a venerable edifice; and although I cannot conscientiouslyapprove of the beautifying and repairing which are going on therein, yet Iwill do the _planner_ the justice to say, that a more gentlemanly,liberally-minded, and truly amiable clergyman is perhaps no where to befound,--within or without the diocese to which he belongs. Attached to thenorth transept or side door, parallel with the street, is a long pole."What might this mean?" "Sir, this pole was crowned at the top by agarland, and by the white flag of _St. Louis_,[169]--which were hoisted toreceive me on my return from my long expatriation"--and the eyes of thenarrator were suffused with tears, as he made the answer! It is of noconsequence how small the income of an unmarried minister, may be, when hethus lives so entirely in the HEARTS OF HIS FLOCK. This church bearsabundant evidence, within and without, of what is called the restoration ofthe Gothic order during the reign of Francis I.: although the mostessential and the greater portion is evidently of the latter part of thefourteenth century.[170] Having expressed my admiration of the manufactureof wax candles (for religious purposes) which I had frequently observed inthe town, Monsieur Mouton, upon taking me into the sacristy (similar to ourvestry-room) begged I would do him the honour to accept of any which mightbe lying upon the table. These candles are made of the purest white wax: ofa spiral, or twisted, or square, or circular form; of considerable lengthand width. They are also decorated with fillagree work, and tinsel ofvarious colours. Upon that which I chose, there were little rosettes madeof wax. The moderate sum for which they are obtained, startles anEnglishman who thinks of the high price of this article of trade in his owncountry. You see frequently, against the walls and pillars of the choir,fragments of these larger wax candles, guttering down and begrimed from theuses made of them in time of worship. In this sacristy there were twolittle boys swinging _wooden_ censers, by way of practice for the moreperfect use of them, when charged with frankincense, at the altar. Tomanage these adroitly--as the traveller is in the constant habit ofobserving during divine worship--is a matter of no very quick or easyattainment.From the Cur? we proceed to the Comte DE LA FRESNAYE; whose pleasantlysituated mansion had been pointed out to me, as you may remember, by theformer. Passing over one of the bridges, leading towards _Guibray_, andascending a gentle eminence to the left, I approached the outer lodge ofthis large and respectable-looking mansion. The Count and family were atdinner: but at _three_ they would rise from table. "Meanwhile," said theporter, it might give me pleasure to walk in the garden." It was one of theloveliest days imaginable. Such a sky--blue, bright, and cloudless--I hadscarcely before seen. The garden was almost suffocated with lilacs andlaburnums, glittering in their respective liveries of white, purple, andyellow. I stepped into a berceau--and sitting upon a bench, bethought me ofthe strange visit I was about to make--as well as of all the pleasingpastoral poetry and painting which I had read in the pages of De Lille, orviewed upon the canvas of Watteau. The clock of the church of _St. Gervais_struck three; when, starting from my reverie, I knocked at the hall-door,and was announced to the family, (who had just risen from dinner) abovestairs. A circle of five gentlemen would have alarmed a very nervousvisitor; but the Count, addressing me in a semi-British and semi-Gallicphraseology, immediately dissipated my fears. In five minutes he was madeacquainted with the cause of this apparent intrusion.Nothing could exceed his amiable frankness. The very choicest wine wascirculated at his table; of which I partook in a more decided manner on thefollowing day--when he was so good as to invite me to dine. When I touchedupon his favourite theme of Norman Antiquities, he almost shouted aloud thename of INGULPH,--that "cher ami de Guillaume le Conqu?rant!" I wasunwilling to trespass long; but I soon found the advantage of making use ofthe name of "Monsieur Mouton--l'estimable Cur? de la Sainte Trinit?."[Illustration]In a stroll to Guibray, towards sunset the next day, I passed through aconsiderable portion of the Count's property, about 300 acres, chiefly ofpasture land. The evening was really enchanting; and through the branchesof the coppice wood the sun seemed to be setting in a bed of molten gold.Our conversation was animated and incessant. In the old and curious churchof Guibray, the Count shewed us his family pew with the care andparticularity of an old country squire. Meanwhile Mr. Lewis was making ahasty copy of one of the very singular ornaments--representing _Christbearing his cross_--which was suspended against the walls of the altar of aside chapel. You have it here. It is frightfully barbarous, andcharacteristic of the capricious style of art which frequently prevailedabout the year 1520: but the wonder is, how such a wretched performancecould obtain admission into the sanctuary where it was deposited. It washowever the pious gift of the vestry woman--who shewed us the interior--andwho had religiously rescued it, during the Revolution, from the demolitionof a neighbouring abbey. The eastern end of this church is perhaps as oldas any ecclesiastical edifice in Normandy;[171] and its exterior (to whichwe could only approach by wading through rank grass as high as our knees)is one of the most interesting of its kind. During our admiration of allthat was curious in this venerable edifice, we were struck by our oldfriends, the _penitents_,--busy in making confession. In more than oneconfessional there were two penitents; and towards one of these, thusdoubly attended, I saw a very large, athletic, hard-visaged priesthastening, just having slipt on his surplice in the vestry. Indeed I hadbeen cursorily introduced to him by the Count. It was Saturday evening, andthe ensuing Sunday was to be marked by some grand procession.The village-like town of Guibray presents a most singular sight to the eyeof a stranger. There are numerous little narrow streets, with every windowclosed by wooden shutters, and every door fastened. It appears as if theplague had recently raged there, and that the inhabitants had quitted itfor ever. Not a creature is visible: not a sound is heard: not a mouseseems to be stirring. And yet Guibray boasts of the LARGEST FAIR in France,save one![172] This, my friend, precisely accounts for the aspect ofdesolation just described. During the intervals of these _triennial_ fairs,the greater part of the village is uninhabited: venders and purchasersflocking and crowding by hundreds when they take place. In a short, narrowstreet--where nothing animated was to be seen--the Count assured me thatsometimes, in the course of one morning, several millions of francs werespent in the purchase of different wares. We left this very strange placewith our minds occupied by a variety of reflections: but at any rate highlypleased and gratified by the agreeable family which had performed the partof guides on the occasion. In the evening, a professor of music treated uswith some pleasing tunes upon the guitar--which utterly astonished theCount--and it was quite night-fall when we returned homewards, towards ourquarters at the hotel of the _Grand Turc_.A memorable incident occurred in our way homewards; which, when made known,will probably agitate the minds and shake the faith of two-thirds of themembers of our Society of Antiquaries. You may remember that I told you,when at Caen, that the Abbe De la Rue had notified to me what were theobjects more particularly deserving of attention in my further progressthrough Normandy. Among these, he particularly mentioned a figure or headof William the Conqueror at Falaise. In the _Place St. Gervais_, thiswonderful head was said to exist--and to exist there only. It was at thehouse of an Innkeeper--certainly not moving in the highest circle of hiscalling. I lost little time in visiting it; and found it situated at thetop of a dark narrow staircase, projecting from the wall, to the right,just before you reach the first floor. Some sensation had been excited bythe enquiries, which I had previously set on foot; and on a second visit,several people were collected to receive us. Lights, warm water, towels,soap and brushes, were quickly put in requisition. I commenced operationswith a kitchen knife, by carefully scraping away all the layers of hardenedwhite and ochre washes, with which each generation had embedded and almostobliterated every feature. By degrees, the hair became manifest: thenfollowed the operation of soap and water--which brought out the features ofthe face; and when the eyes fully and distinctly appeared, the exclamationof "_Mon Dieu_!" by the spectators, was loud and unremitting. The nose hadreceived a serious injury by having its end broken off. Anon, stood forththe mouth; and when the "whiskered majesty" of the beard became evident, itwas quite impossible to repress the simultaneous ejaculation of joy andastonishment ... "_Voil? le vrai portrait de Guillaume le Conqu?rant_!The whiskers apparently denote it to be rather _Saxon_ than _Norman_. Thehead is nearly eleven inches in length, by seven and a half in width: iscut upon a very coarse, yet hard-grained stone--and rests upon a square,unconnected stone:--embedded within the wall. If it ever had shoulders andbody, those shoulders and body were no part of the present appendages ofthe head. What then, is the Abb? de la Rue in error? The more liberalinference will be, that the Abb? de la Rue had never seen it. As to itsantiquity, I am prepared to admit it to be very considerable; and, if youplease, even before the period of the loves of the father and mother of thecharacter whom it is supposed to represent. In the morning, Madame Rolleseemed disposed to take ten louis (which I freely offered her) for herprecious fragment: but the distinct, collected view of whiskers, mouth,nose, eyes, and hair, instantaneously raised the quicksilver of herexpectations to "_quinze_ louis pour le moins!" That was infinitely "tropfort"--and we parted without coming to any terms. Perhaps you will laugh atme for the previous offer.The church of St. Gervais is called the mother church of the town: and itis right that you should have some notion of it. It stands upon a finelyelevated situation. Its interior is rather capacious: but it has no verygrand effect-arising from simplicity or breadth of architecture. Thepillars to the right of the nave, on entering from the western extremity,are doubtless old; perhaps of the beginning of the thirteenth century. Thearches are a flattened semicircle; while those on the opposite side arecomparatively sharp, and of a considerably later period. The ornaments ofthe capitals of these older pillars are, some of them, sufficientlycapricious and elaborate; while others are of a more exceptionablecharacter on the score of indelicacy. But this does not surprise a man whohas been accustomed to examine ART, of the middle centuries, whether insculpture or in painting. The side aisles are comparatively modern. Thepillars of the choir have scarcely any capitals beyond a simple rim orfillet; and are surmounted by sharp low arches, like what are to be seen atSt. Lo and Coutances. The roof of the left side aisle is perfectly greenfrom damp: the result, as at Coutances, of thereof having been stripped forthe sake of the lead to make bullets, &c. during the Revolution. I saw thislarge church completely filled on Sunday, at morning service--about eleven:and, in the congregation, I observed several faces and figures, of bothsexes, which indicated great intelligence and respectability. Indeed therewas much of the air of a London congregation about the whole.From the Church, we may fairly make any thing but a digression--indiscoursing of one of its brightest ornaments, in the person of MonsieurLANGEVIN:--a simple priest--as he styles himself in an octavo volume, whichentitles him to the character of the best living HISTORIAN OF FALAISE. Heis a mere officiating minister in the church of Mons. Mouton; and hissalary, as he led me to infer, could be scarcely twenty louis per annum.Surely this man is among the most amiable and excellent of God's creatures!But it is right that you should know the origin and progress of ouracquaintance. It was after dinner, on one of the most industriously spentof my days here--and the very second of my arrival,--that the waiterannounced the arrival of the Abb? Langevin, in the passage, with a copy ofhis History beneath his arm. The door opened, and in walked thestranger--habited in his clerical garb--with a physiognomy so benign andexpressive, and with manners so gentle and well-bred,--that I roseinstinctively from my seat to give him the most cordial reception. Hereturned my civility in a way which shewed at once that he was a man of themost interesting simplicity of character. "He was aware (he said) that hehad intruded; but as he understood "Monsieur was in pursuit of theantiquities of the place, he had presumed to offer for his acceptance acopy of a work upon that subject--of which he was the humble author." Thiswork was a good sized thick crown octavo, filling five hundred closely andwell-printed pages; and of which the price was _fifty sous_! The worthypriest, seeing my surprise on his mentioning the price, supposed that I hadconsidered it as rather extravagant. But this error was rectified in aninstant. I ordered _three copies_ of his historical labours, and told himmy conscience would not allow me to pay him less than _three francs_ percopy. He seemed to be electrified: rose from his seat:--and lifting up oneof the most expressive of countenances, with eyes apparently suffused withtears--raised both his hands, and exclaimed.... "Que le bon Dieu vousb?nisse--les Anglois sont vraiement g?n?reux!"For several seconds I sat riveted to my seat. Such an unfeigned and warmacknowledgment of what I had considered as a mere matter-of-courseproposition, perfectly astounded me: the more so, as it was accompanied bya gesture and articulation which could not fail to move any bosom--notabsolutely composed of marble. We each rallied, and resumed theconversation. In few but simple words he told me his history. He hadcontrived to weather out the Revolution, at Falaise. His former prefermenthad been wholly taken from him; and he was now a simple assistant in thechurch of Mons. Mouton. He had yielded without resistance; as even_remonstrance_ would have been probably followed up by the guillotine. Tosolace himself in his afflictions, he had recourse to his old favouritestudies of _medicine_ and _music_;--and had in fact practised the former."But come, Sir, (says he) come and do me the honour of a call--when itshall suit you." I settled it for the ensuing day. On breaking up andtaking leave, the amiable stranger modestly spoke of his History. It hadcost him three years' toil; and he seemed to mention, with an air oftriumph, the frequent references in it to the _Gallia Christiana_, and to_Chartularies_ and _Family Records_ never before examined. On the next dayI carried my projected visit into execution--towards seven in the evening.The lodgings of M. Langevin are on the second floor of a house belonging toa carpenter. The worthy priest received me on the landing-place, in themost cheerful and chatty manner. He has three small rooms on the samefloor. In the first, his library is deposited. On my asking him to let mesee what _old books_ he possessed, he turned gaily round, andreplied--"Comment donc, Monsieur, vous aimez les vieux livres? A ?a,voyons!" Whereupon he pulled away certain strips or pieces of wainscot, andshewed me his book-treasures within the recesses. On my recognising a_Colin?us_ and _Henry Stephen_, ere he had read the title of the volumes,he seemed to marvel exceedingly, and to gaze at me as a conjuror. Hebetrayed more than ordinary satisfaction on shewing his _Latin Galen_ and_Hippocrates_; and the former, to the best of my recollection, containedLatin notes in the margin, written by himself. These tomes were followed upby a few upon _alchymy_ and _astrology_; from which, and the consequentconversation, I was led to infer that the amiable possessor entertained duerespect for those studies which had ravished our DEES and ASHMOLES of old.In the second room stood an upright piano forte--the _manufacture_, as wellas the property, of Monsieur Langevin. It bore the date of 1806; and wasconsidered as the first of the kind introduced into Normandy. It wasimpossible not to be struck with the various rational sources of amusement,by means of which this estimable character had contrived to beguile thehours of his misfortunes. There was a calm, collected, serenity of mannerabout him--a most unfeigned and unqualified resignation to the divinewill--which marked him as an object at once of admiration and esteem.There was no boast--no cant--no formal sermonising. You _saw_ whatreligion had done for him. Her effects _spake_ in his discourse and inhis life.... Over his piano hung a portrait of himself; veryindifferently executed--and not strongly resembling the original. "Wecan do something more faithful than this, sir, if you will allowit"--said I, pointing to Mr. Lewis: and it was agreed that he shouldgive the latter a sitting on the morrow. The next day M. Langevin camepunctually to his appointment, for the purpose of having his portraittaken.On telling this original that the pencil drawing of Mr. Lewis (which by thebye was executed in about an hour and a half) should be_engraved_--inasmuch as he was the modern _Historian of Falaise_--he seemedabsolutely astonished. He moved a few paces gently forwards, and turninground, with hands and eyes elevated, exclaimed, in a tremulous andheart-stricken tone of voice, "Ah, mon Dieu!" I will not dissemble that Itook leave of him with tears, which were with difficulty concealed. "Adieu,pour toujours!"--were words which he uttered with all the sincerity, andwith yet more pathos, than was even shewn by Pierre Aim? Lair at Caen. Thelandlord and landlady of this hotel are warm in their commendations of him:assuring me that his name is hardly ever pronounced without the mention ofhis virtues. He has just entered his sixty-second year.[173]It remains only to give an account of the progress of Printing and ofLiterature in this place: although the latter ought to precede the former.As a literary man, our worthy acquaintance the Comte de la Fresnaye takesthe lead: yet he is rather an amateur than a professed critic. He haswritten upon the antiquities of the town; but his work is justly consideredinferior to that of Monsieur Langevin. He quotes _Wace_ frequently, andwith apparent satisfaction; and he promises a French version of his beloved_Ingulph_. Falaise is a quiet, dull place of resort, for those who formtheir notions of retirement as connected with the occasional bustle andanimation of Caen and Rouen. But the situation is pleasing. The skies areserene: the temperature is mild, and the fruits of the earth are abundantand nutritious. Many of the more respectable inhabitants expressed theirsurprise to me that there were so few English resident in itsneighbourhood--so much preferable, on many accounts to that of Caen. Butour countrymen, you know, are sometimes a little capricious in the objectsof their choice. Just now, it is the _fashion_ for the English to reside atCaen; yet when you consider that the major part of our countrymen residethere for the purpose of educating their children--and that Caen, from itsnumerous seminaries of education, contains masters of every description,whose lessons are sometimes as low as a frank for each--it is notsurprising that Falaise is deserted for the former place. For myself--andfor all those who love a select society, a sweet country, and rather aplentiful sprinkle of antiquarian art,--for such, in short, who would readthe fabliaux of the old Norman bards in peace, comfort, and silence--therecan be no question about the preference to be given to the spot from whichI send this my last Norman despatch.I have before made mention of the fountains in this place. They are equallynumerous and clear. The inn in which we reside has not fewer than threefountains--or rather of _jets d'eau_--constantly playing. Those in the_Place St. Trinit? Grand Rue_, and _Place St. Gervais_, are the largest;but every gutter trickles with water as if dissolved from the purestcrystal. It has been hot weather during the greater part of our stay; andthe very sight of these translucent streams seems to refresh one's languidframe. But I proceed chiefly to the productions of the PRESS. They do agood deal of business here in the way of ephemeral publications. Letellier,situated in the Grande Rue, is the chief printer of _chap books_: and if wejudge from the general character of these, the _Falaisois_ seem to bemarvellously addicted to the effusions of the muse. Indeed, their ballads,of all kinds, are innumerable. Read a few--which are to be found in thevery commonest publications. There is something rather original, and of avery pleasingly tender cast, in the first two:  LE BAISER D'ADIEUX.  Pres de toi l'heur? du myst?re  Ne m'appellera plus demain,  Vers ta demeure solitaire  Mes pas me guideront en vain;  J'ai respir? ta douce haleine,  Et des pleurs ont mouill? mes yeux,  J'ai tout senti, plaisir et peine,  )  J'ai re?u ton baiser d'adieux.      ) _bis._    Tu pars, et malgr? ta promesse  Rien ne m'assure de ta foi,  Nul souvenir de ta tendresse  Ne vient me dire: Pense ? moi.  Ton amour qu'envain je r?clame  Ne me laisse, en quittant ces lieux,  Que Phumide et brulante flamme  De ton dernier baiser d'adieux.    Puisse au moins ton indiff?rence  Te garder d'un nouvel amour.  Et le veuvage de l'absence  H?ter ton fortun? retour!  Puisse alors l'amant qui t'adore,  Te revoyant aux m?mes lieux,  Sur tes l?vres vierges encore  Retrouver son baiser d'adieux!       *       *       *       *       *  L'IMAGE DE LA VIE.  Nous naissons et dans notre coeur,  A peine aux portes de la vie,  Tout au plaisir, tout au bonheur,  Et nous invite et nous convie;  D'abord, simples amusements  Savent contenter notre enfance;  Mais bient?t aux jeux innocens,  L'amour nous prend ... sans qu'on y pense.  Fillette ? l'?ge de quinze ans,  Offre l'image de la rose,  Qui d?s l'approche du printemps,  Entr'ouvre sa feuille mi-close;  Bient?t l'aiguillon du d?sir  Vient ouvrir fleur d'innocence,  Et sous la bouche du plaisir,  Elle s'?cl?t ... sans qu'elle y pense.  Vous, qui pendant vos jeunes ans,  Ne courtisez pas la folie,  Songez donc que cet heureux temps  Ne dure pas toute la vie,  Assez vite il nous faut quitter  Tendres ardeurs, vives jouissances;  Et dans uu coeur qui sait aimer,  La raison vient ... sans qu'on y pense.  Mais enfin, sur l'?ile du temps,  On arrive au but du voyage,  Et l'on voit la glace des ans,  Couronner nos fronts ? cet ?ge;  S'il fut sensible ? la piti?,  S'il cultiva la bienfaisance,  Entre les bras de l'amiti?  L'homme finit ... sans qu'il y penseYou must know that they are here great lovers of royalty, and of coursegreat supporters of the Bourbon Family. The King's printer is a Mons. BR?El'Ain?. He is a very pleasant, well-bred man, and lives in the _PlaceTrinit?_. I have paid him more than one visit, and always felt additionalpleasure at every repetition of it. My first visit was marked with asomewhat ludicrous circumstance. On entering the compositors' room, Iobserved, pasted upon the walls, in large capital letters, the followingwell known words:  GOD SAVE THE KING.Both Monsieur Br?e l'Ain?--and his workmen were equally gratified by mynotice and commendation of this sentiment. "It is the favourite sentiment,Sir, of your country,"--remarked the master. To this I readily assented."It is also, Sir, the favourite one of our own," replied M. Br?el'Ain?--and his men readily attested their concurrence in the same reply."Ah, Sir, if you would only favour us by _singing the air_, to which thesewords belong, you would infinitely oblige us all" ... said a shrewd andintelligent-looking compositor. "With all my heart"--rejoined I--"but Imust frankly tell you, that I shall sing it rather with heart than withvoice--being neither a vocal nor an instrumental performer." "No matter:give us only a notion of it." They all stood round in a circle, and I gotthrough two stanzas as gravely and as efficiently as I was able. The usual"charmant!" followed my exertions. It was now my turn to ask a favour."Sing to me your favourite national air of ROBERT and ARLETTE." "Mostwillingly, Sir," replied the forementioned "shrewd and intelligent-lookingcompositor." "Tenez: un petit moment: je vais chercher mon violon. Ca iramieux."He left the house in search of his violin. The tune of the National airwhich he sung was both agreeable and lively: and upon the whole it wasdifficult to say which seemed to be the better pleased with the respectivenational airs. M. Br?e shewed me his premises in detail. They had beenformerly a portion of an old church; and are situated on the edge of thegreat fosse which encircles the town. A garden, full of sweet bloomingflowers, is behind them; and the view backwards is cheerful andpicturesque. There are generally five presses at work; which, for aprovincial printing office, shews business to be far from slack. Mons. B.sells a great number of almanacks, and prints all the leading publicationsconnected with the town. In fact, his title, as _Imprimeur du Roi_,supposes him to take the principal lead as a printer. This agreeable manhas a brother who is professor of rhetoric in the Coll?ge Royale at Paris.Of _Bouquinistes_, or dealers in old books, there are scarcely any. I spentthree or four fruitless hours in a search after old chronicles and oldpoetry: and was compelled, almost from pure civility, to purchase ofDUFOURS a _Petit's Virgil_ of 1529, folio--which will be hardly worth thecarriage. I tried hard for a fine copy of _Fauchet's Origines de la Po?sieFran?oise_, 1581, 4to. with the head of the author, but in vain; yetendeavoured to console myself by an old blue morocco copy of _Les regretset tristes lamentations du Comte de Montgomery_, by _Demorenne_, Rouen,1574, 8vo. as well as a clean, fresh, and almost crackling copy of_Amoureuses occupations de la Taysonniere_, Lyon, 1555, 8vo.--for twofrancs each--and both destined for the rich and choice library of ourfriend....Thus much for FALAISE: for a spot, which, from the uniform serenity of theweather since I have been here--from the comfort of the inn--from theextreme civility and attention of the townspeople--and from the yet moreinteresting society of the Comte de la Fresnaye, the _Cur?s_ Mouton andLangevin--together with the amenity of the surrounding country, and theinteresting and in part magnificent remains of antiquity--can never beerased from my recollection. It is here that the tourist and antiquary mayfind objects for admiration and materials for recording. I have done both:admired and recorded--happy, if the result of such occupations shall havecontributed to the substantial gratification of yourself and of our commonfriends. And now, farewell; not only to Falaise, but to NORMANDY. I shallleave it, from this delightful spot, in the most thorough good humour, andwith more than ordinary regret that my stay has necessarily been short. Ihave taken my place in the Diligence, direct for PARIS. "Il n'y a qu'unParis"--said the Comte de la Fresnaye to me the other day, when I told himI had never been there--to which I replied, "Are there then TWO Londons?"Thirty-six hours will settle all this. In the mean time, adieu.[169] On the return of Louis the XVIII. the town of Falaise manifested its    loyalty in the most unequivocal manner.      COUPLETS      _Chant?s par les El?ves du Coll?ge de Falaise, en arborant le      Drapeau Blanc_.      Air: _Un Soldat par un coup funeste_.        Loin de nous la sombre tristesse,        Mars a d?pos? sa fureur;        Enfin la foudre vengeresse        Vient de terrasser _l'opresseur,_            L'aigle sanguinaire        Succombe ? l'aspect de ces LYS.      Peuple fran?ais, tu vas revoir ton P?re!        Vive le Roi! Vive LOUIS!

Si la perfidie        De nouveau troubloit ton bonheur      Viens nous guider, ? Banni?re ch?rie!        Nous volerons au champ d'honneur.[170] The worthy historian of Falaise, quoted in a preceding page, is    exceedingly anxious to make us believe that there are portions of this    church--namely, four stones--in the eastern and western gable    ends--which were used in the consecration of it, by MATHILDA, the wife    of our first William. Also, that, at the gable end of the south    transept, outside, an ancient grotto,--in which the Gallic priests of    old purified themselves for the mysteries of their religion--is now    converted into the sacristy, or vestry, or robing room. But these are    surely mere antiquarian dreams. The same author more sagaciously    informs us that the exact period of the commencement of the building    of the nave, namely in 1438, is yet attested by an existing    inscription, in gothic letters, towards the chief door of entrance.    The inscription also testifies that in the same year, "there reigned    DEATH, WAR, and FAMINE." The _chancel of the choir_, with the    principal doors of entrance, &c. were constructed between the years    1520, and 1540. It may be worth remarking that the stalls of the choir    were brought from the Abbey of St. John--on the destruction of that    monastic establishment in 1729; and that, according to the _Gallia    Christiana_, vol. xi. p. 756, these stalls were carved at the desire    of Thomas II. de Mallebiche, abbot of that establishment in 1506-1516.    In a double niche of the south buttress are the statues of HERPIN and    his WIFE; rich citizens of Falaise, who, by their wealth, greatly    contributed to the building of the choir. (Their grandson, HERPIN    LACHENAYE, together with his mistress were killed, side by side, in    fighting at one of the gates of Falaise to repel the successful troops    of Henry IV.) The _Chapel of the Virgin_, behind the choir, was    completed about the year 1631. LANGEVIN, p. 81-128-131.[171] We have of course nothing to do with the first erection of a place of    worship at Guibray in the VIIIth century. The story connected with the    earliest erection is this. The faubourg of Guibray, distant about 900    paces from Falaise, was formerly covered with chestnut and oak trees.    A sheep, scratching the earth, as if by natural instinct (I quote the    words of M. Langevin the historian of Falaise) indicated, by its    bleatings, that something was beneath. The shepherd approached, and    hollowing out the earth with his crook, discovered a statue of the    Virgin, with a child in its arms. The first church, dedicated to the    Virgin, under the reign of Charles Martel, called the Victorious, was    in consequence erected--on this very spot--in the centre of this    widely spreading wood of chestnut and oak. I hasten to the    construction of a second church, on the same site, under the auspices    of Mathilda, the wife of the Conqueror: with the statue of a woman    with a diadem upon her head--near one of the pillars: upon which    statue Langevin discourses learnedly in a note. But neither this    church nor the statue in question are now in existence. On the    contrary, the oldest portions of the church of Guibray, now    existing--according to the authors of the _Gallia Christiana_, vol.    xi. p. 878, and an ancient MS. consulted by M. Langevin--are of about    the date of 1222; when the church was consecrated by the Bishop of    Coutances. The open space towards the south, now called _La Place aux    Chevaux_, was the old burying ground of the church. There was also a    chapel, dedicated to St. Gervais, which was pillaged and destroyed by    the Hugonots in 1562. I should add, that the South-East exterior    (behind the chancel) of this very curious old church at Guibray,    resembles, upon a small scale, what M. Cotman has published of the    same portion of St. Georges de Bocherville. _Recherches sur Falaise_,    p. 49-53. Monsieur le Comte de la Fresnaye, in his _Notice Historique    sur Falaise_, 1816, 8vo. will have it, that "the porch of this church,    the only unmutilated portion remaining of its ancient structure,    demonstrates the epoch of the origin of Christianity among the Gauls."    "At least, such is the decision of M. Deveze, draftsman for Laborde;    the latter of whom now Secretary to the Count d'Artois, instituted a    close examination of the whole fabric." p. 5-6. I hope there are not    many such conclusions to be found in the magnificent and meritorious    productions of LABORDE.[172] This fair lasts full fifteen days. The first eight days are devoted    to business of a more important nature--which they call the GREAT    WEEK: that is to say, the greatest number of merchants attend during    the earlier part of it; and contracts of greater extent necessarily    take place. The remaining seven days are called the LITTLE WEEK--in    which they make arrangements to carry their previous bargains into    effect, and to return home. Men and merchandise, from all quarters,    and of all descriptions, are to be seen at this fair. Even Holland and    Germany are not wanting in sending their commercial representatives.    Jewellery and grocery seem to be the chief articles of commerce; but    there is a prodigious display of silk, linen, and cotton, &c.: as well    as of hides, raw and tanned; porcelaine and earthen ware. The live    cattle market must not be forgotten. Langevin says that, of horses    alone, they sometimes sell full four thousand. Thus much for the buyer    and seller. But this fair is regularly enlivened by an immense    confluence of nobility and gentry from the adjacent country--to    partake of the amusements, which, (as with the English,) form the    invariable appendages of the scene. Langevin mentions the minor fairs    of _Ste. Croix, St. Michel_, and _St. Gervais_, which help to bring    wealth into the pockets of the inhabitants. _Recherches Historiques    sur Falaise_; p. 199, &c.[173] [Since the publication of this Tour, the amiable Mons. Langevin has    published "additions" to his historical account of Falaise; and in    those additions, he has been pleased to notice the account which is    HERE given of his labours and character. It would be bad--at least    hardly justifiable--taste, to quote that notice: yet I cannot    dissemble the satisfaction to find that there is _more_ than ONE    sympathising heart in Normandy, which appreciates this record of its    excellence. I subjoin, therefore, with the greatest satisfaction, a    fac-simile of the autograph of this amiable and learned man, as it    appears written (at my request) in the title-page of a copy of his    "Researches."    [Illustration: Langevin ptre.]LETTER XXI.JOURNEY TO PARIS. DREUX. HOUDAN. VERSAILLES. ENTRANCE INTO PARIS._Paris, Rue Faubourg Poissoni?re, May_ 30, 1819."Time and the hour runs through the roughest day." They must be protactedmiseries indeed which do not, at some period or other, have something likea termination. I am here, then my good friend--safe and sound at last;comfortably situated in a boarding house, of which the mistress is anagreeable Englishwoman and the master an intelligent Swiss. I havesauntered, gazed, and wondered--and exchanged a thousand graciouscivilities! I have delivered my epistolary credentials: have shaken handswith Monsieur Van Praet; have paced the suite of rooms in which therenowned BIBLIOTHEQUE DU ROI is deposited: have traversed the _Thuileries_and the _Louvre_; repeatedly reconnoitred the _Boulevards_; viewed the giltdome of the _H?tel des Invalides_, and the white flag upon thebronze-pillar in the _Place Vendome_; seen crowds of our countrymen at_Meurice's_ and in the hotels about the _Rue de la Paix;_ partaken of therival ices of _Tortoni_ and the _Caff? des Mille Colonnes_; bought oldFrench poetry at a Bouquiniste's: and drank Chambertin and Champagne at therichly garnished table of our ----. These are what may be called good_foreground objects_ in the composition of a Parisian picture. Now for thefilling up of the canvas with appropriate and harmonizing detail.A second reflection corrects however the precipitancy of such a proposal;for it cannot be, in this my _first_ despatch, that you are to receive anything like an adequate notion of the topics thus hastily thrown together onthe first impulse of Parisian inspiration. Wait patiently, therefore: andat least admire the methodical precision of my narrative. My last letterleft me on the eve of departure from Falaise; and it is precisely from thatplace that I take up the thread of my journal. We were to leave it, as Itold you, in the Diligence--on the evening of the Sunday, immediatelyfollowing the date of the despatch transmitted. I shall have reason toremember that journey for many a day to come; but, "post varios casus, &c."I am thankful to find myself safely settled in my present comfortableabode. The Sabbath, on the evening of which the Diligence usually startsfor Paris, happened to be a festival. Before dawn of day I heard incessantjuvenile voices beneath the window of my bedroom at the Grand Turc; Whatmight this mean? Between three and four, as the day began to break, I rose,and approaching the window, saw, from thence, a number of little boys andgirls busied in making artificial flower-beds and sand-borders, &c. Theirtongues and their bodily movements were equally unintermitting. It wasimpossible for a stranger to guess at the meaning of such a proceeding;but, opening the window, I thought there could be no harm in asking a verysimple question--which I will confess to you was put in rather an irritablemanner on my part ... for I had been annoyed by their labours for more thanthe last hour. "What are you about, there?" I exclaimed--"Ha, is it youSir?" replied a little arch boy--mistaking me for some one else. "Yes,(resumed I) tell me what you are about there?" "in truth, we are making_R?posoirs_ for the FETE-DIEU: the Host will pass this way by and bye. Isit not a pretty thing, Sir?" exclaimed a sweetly modulated female voice.All my irritability was softened in a moment; and I was instantly convincedthat Solomon never delivered a wiser sentiment than when he said--"A softanswer turneth away wrath!" I admitted the prettiness of the thing withoutcomprehending a particle of it: and telling them to speak in a lower key,shut the window, and sought my bed. But sleep had ceased to seek me: andthe little urchins, instead of lowering their voices, seemed to break forthin a more general and incessant vociferation. In consequence, I was almostfeverish from restlessness--when the fille de chambre announced that "itwas eight o'clock, and the morning most beautiful."These _r?posoirs_ are of more importance than you are aware of. Theyconsist of little spots, or spaces in the streets, garnished with flowers,and intersected by walks, marked with fine gravel, in the centre of whichthe Host rests, on its passing to and fro from the several parishes. When Irose to dress, I observed the work of art--which had been in progressduring the night--perfectly complete. Passengers were forbidden to trespassby pieces of string fastened to different parts by way of a fence--or,whoever chose to walk within, considered themselves bound to deposit a sousas the condition of gratifying their curiosity. Upon the whole, thisr?posoir might be about sixteen feet square. Towards eleven o'clock thedifferent religious ceremonies began. On one side the noise of the drum,and the march of the national guard, indicated that military mass was aboutto be performed; on the other, the procession of priests, robed andofficiating--the elevation of banners--and the sonorous responses of bothlaity and clergy--put the whole town into agitation, and made every inmateof every mansion thrust his head out of window, to gaze at the passingspectacle. We were among the latter denomination of lookers on, andrecognised, with no small gratification, our clerical friends MessieursMouton, Langevin, and the huge father confessor at Guibra, followed by agreat number of respectable citizens, among whom the Comte de la Fresnayeand his amiable and intelligent son (recently married) made mostrespectable figures; They approached the r?posoir in question. The priests,with the Host, took their station within it; silence followed; oneofficiating clergyman then knelt down; shut, what seemed to be, the woodencovers of a book,--with, considerable violence--rose--turned round, and theprocession being again put in motion--the whole marched away to the churchof the Holy Trinity;--whither I followed it; and where I witnessed what Iwas unable to comprehend, and what I should not feel much disposed toimitate. But let every country be allowed to reverence and respect its ownparticular religious ceremonies. We may endure what we cannot commend ...and insult and disrespect are among the last actions which a well regulatedmind will shew in its treatment of such matters. I should add, that theser?posoirs, a few hours after the performance of the ceremony justdescribed, are indiscriminately broken up: the flowers and the little sandbanks falling equally a prey to the winds and the feet of the passenger.Opposite to the inn was an hospital for the female sick. It had beenformerly an establishment of very considerable extent and celebrity; butwhether it was originally connected with the hospital of the _L?proserie deSaint Lasare_, (about which the Abb? Langevin's History of Falaise israther curious) the _H?tel-Dieu_, or the _H?pital G?n?ral_, I cannot takeupon me to pronounce. Certain it is, however, that this establishment doesgreat credit to those who have the conduct of it. As foreigners, andparticularly as Englishmen, we were permitted to see the whole, withoutreserve. On my return from witnessing the ceremony at the church of theTrinity, I visited this hospital: my companion having resumed his graphicoperations before the Castle. I shall not easily forget the face and figureof the matron. To a countenance of masculine feature, and masculinecomplexion--including no ordinary growth of beard, of a raven tint--sheadded a sturdy, squat, muscular figure--which, when put into action, movedin a most decided manner. A large bunch of massive keys was suspended froma girdle at her side; and her dress, which was black, was rendered morecharacteristic and striking, by the appearance of, what are yet called,_bustles_ above her hips. As she moved, the keys and the floor seemedequally to shake beneath her steps. The elder Smirke would have paintedthis severe Duenna-like looking matron with inimitable force and truth.But ... she no sooner opened her mouth, than all traits of severityvanished. Her voice was even musical, and her "fa?on de parler" mostgracious. She shewed me the whole establishment with equal good humourand alertness; and I don't know when I ever made such a number of bows(to the several female patients in the wards) within such limited timeand space. The whole building has the air of a convent; and there wereseveral architectural relics, perhaps of the end of the fifteenthcentury, which I only regretted were not of portable dimensions; as,upon making enquiry, little objection seemed to be made to thegratuitous disposal of them.The hour for departure, after sun-set, having arrived, we were summoned tothe Diligence when, bidding adieu to the very worthy host and hostess ofthe _Grand Turc_, (whom I strongly recommend all Englishmen to visit) Imade up my mind for a thirty-six hour's journey--as I was to reach Paris onTuesday morning. The day had been excessively hot for the season of theyear; and the night air was refreshing. But after a few snatches ofsleep--greatly needed--there appeared manifest symptoms of decay anddownfall in the gloomy and comfortless machine in which we took ourdeparture. In other words, towards daylight, and just as we approached_L'Aigle_, the left braces (which proved to be thoroughly rotted leather)broke in two: and down slid, rather than tumbled, the Falaise Diligence!There were two French gentlemen, and an elderly lady, besides ourselves inthe coach. While we halted, in order to repair the machine, the Frenchmenfound consolation in their misfortune by running to a caff?, (it wasbetween four and five in the morning), rousing the master and mistress, andas I thought, peremptorily and impertinently asking for coffee: while theyamused themselves with billiards during its preparation. I was in no humourfor eating, drinking, or playing: for here was a second sleepless night!Having repaired this crazy vehicle, we rumbled on for _Verneuil_; where itwas exchanged for a diligence of more capacious dimensions. Here, abouteleven o'clock, we had breakfast; and from henceforth let it not be saidthat the art of eating and drinking belongs exclusively to ourcountry:--for such manifestations of appetite, and of attack uponsubstantials as well as fluids, I had scarcely ever before witnessed. I waswell contented with coffee, tea, eggs, and bread--as who might not wellbe?... but my companions, after taking these in flank, cut through thecentre of a roast fowl and a dish of stewed veal: making diversions, in themean while, upon sundry bottles of red and white wine; the fingers, duringthe meal, being as instrumental as the white metal forks.We set off at a good round trot for _Dreux_: and, in the route thither, weascended a long and steep hill, having _Nonancourt_ to the left. Here wesaw some very pretty country houses, and the whole landscape had an air ofEnglish comfort and picturesque beauty about it. Here, too, for the firsttime, I saw a VINEYARD. At this early season of the year it has a moststiff and unseemly look; presenting to the eye scarcely any thing but thebrown sticks, obliquely put into the ground, against which the vine istrained. But the sloping banks, on each side of the ascending road, werecovered with plantations of this precious tree; and I was told that, if the_autumn_ should prove as auspicious as appeared the _spring_, there wouldbe a season of equal gaiety and abundance. I wished it with all my heart.Indeed I felt particularly interested in the whole aspect of the countryabout _Nonancourt_. The sun was fast descending as we entered the town of_Dreux_--where I had resolved upon taking leave both of the diligence andof my companions; and of reaching Paris by post. At seven we dined, orrather perhaps made an early supper; when my fellow travellers _sustained_their reputation for their powers of attack upon fish, flesh, and fowl.Indeed the dinner was equally plentiful and well cooked; and the chargemoderate in proportion. But there is nothing, either on the score ofprovision of reasonableness of cost, like the _table d'h?te_ throughoutFrance; and he who cannot accommodate himself to the hour of dining(usually about one) must make up his mind to worse fare and treble charges.After dinner we strolled in the town, and upon the heights near the castle.We visited the principal church, _St. Jean_, which is very spacious, andupon the whole is a fine piece of architecture. I speak more particularlyof the interior--where I witnessed, however, some of the most horribledevastations, arising from the Revolution, which I had yet seen. In one ofthe side chapels, there _had been_ a magnificent monument; perhaps fromsixteen to twenty feet in height--crowded with figures as large as life,from the base to the summit. It appeared as if some trenchant instrument ofan irresistible force, had shaved away many of the figures; but moreespecially the heads and the arms. This was only one, but the moststriking, specimen of revolutionary Vandalism. There were plenty of similarproofs, on a reduced scale. In the midst of these traces of recent havoc,there was a pleasure mingled with melancholy, in looking up and viewingsome exceedingly pretty specimens of old stained glass:--which had escapedthe destruction committed in the lower regions, and had preserved all theiroriginal freshness. Here and there, in the side chapels, the priests wererobing themselves to attend confession; while the suppliants, in kneelingattitudes, were expecting them by the side of the confessionals. From thechurch I bent my steps to the principal bookseller of the place, whom Ifound to be an intelligent, civil, and extremely good-natured tradesman.But his stock was too modern. "Donnez vous la peine de monter"--exclaimedhe precipitately; begging me to follow him. His up-stairs collection wasscarcely of a more ancient character than that below. There were morecopies of _Voltaire_ and _Rousseau_ than I should have supposed he couldsell in six years--but "on the contrary" (said he) "in six months' time,not a single copy will remain unsold!" I marvelled and grieved at suchintelligence; because the poison was not extracted from the nourishmentcontained in these works. To an enquiry about my old typographical friends,_Verard, Pigouchet_, and _Eustace_, the worthy bibliopole replied "qu'iln'avoit jamais entendu parler de ces gens-la!" Again I marvelled; andhaving no temptation to purchase, civilly wished him good evening.Meanwhile Mr. L. had attained the castle heights, and was lost in a sort ofextacy at the surrounding scene. On entering the outer walls, and directingyour steps towards the summit, you are enchanted with a beautifularchitectural specimen--in the character of a zigzag early Normanarch--which had originally belonged to a small church, recently taken down:The arch alone stands insulated ... beyond which, a new, and apparently avery handsome, church is erecting, chiefly under the care and at theexpence of the present Duke of Orleans;--as a mausoleum for his family--andin which, not many days before our arrival, the remains of one of hischildren had been deposited. I wished greatly for a perfect drawing of thisarch ... but there was no time ... and my companion was exercising hispencil, on the summit, by a minute, bird's eye of the sweep of country tobe seen from this elevated situation--through the greater part of which,indeed, the diligence from _Verneuil_ had recently conducted us. I shouldadd, that not a relic of that CASTLE, which had once kept the town and theadjacent country in awe, is now to be seen: but its outer walls enclose aspace hardly less than twenty acres:--the most considerable area which Ihad yet witnessed. To give a more interesting character to the scenery, thesun, broad and red, was just hiding the lower limb of his disk behind theedge of a purple hill. A quiet, mellow effect reigned throughout thelandscape. I gazed on all sides; and (wherefore, I cannot now say) as Isunk upon the grass, overwhelmed with fatigue and the lassitude of twosleepless nights, wished, in my heart, I could have seen the effect of thatglorious sun-set from, the heights of Dover. Now and then, as when atschool, one feels a little home-sick; but the melancholy mood which thenpossessed me was purely a physical effect from a physical cause. Theshadows of evening began to succeed to the glow of sun-set--when, startingfrom my recumbent position, (in which sleep was beginning to surprise me) Ihastened down the heights, and by a nearer direction sought the town andour hotel. We retired betimes to rest--but not until, from an oppositecoach maker, we had secured a phaeton-like carriage to convey us with posthorses, the next day, to Paris.Excellent beds and undisturbed slumber put me in spirits for the grandentr?e into the metropolis of France. Breakfasting a little afternine--before ten, a pair of powerful black horses, one of which wassurmounted by a sprucely-attired postilion--with the phaeton in therear--were at the door of the hotel. Seeing all our baggage properlysecured, we sprung into the conveyance and darted forward at a smartgallop. The animals seemed as if they could fly away with us--and the whipof the postilion made innumerable circular flourishes above their heads.The sky was beautifully clear: and a briskly-stirring, but not unpleasantlypenetrating, south-east wind, played in our faces as we seemed scarcely tobe sensible of the road. What a contrast to the heat, vexation, and generaluncomfortableness of the two preceding days of our journey! We felt itsensibly, and enjoyed it in proportion. Our first place of halting, tochange horses, was at HOUDAN; which may be about four leagues from Dreux;and I verily believe we reached it in an hour. The route thither is througha flat and uninteresting country; except that every feature of landscape(and more especially in our previous journeys through Normandy) seems to bethrown to a greater distance, than in England. This may account for theflatness of views, and the diminutiveness of objects. Houdan is avillage-like town, containing a population of about 2000 inhabitants; butmuch business is done on market days; and of _corn_, in particular, I wastold that they often sold several thousand sacks in a day. Its contiguityto Paris may account for the quantity of business done. In the outskirts ofthe town,--and flanked, rather than surrounded, by two or three rows oftrees, of scarcely three years growth--stands the "stiff and stower"remains of the _Castle of Houdan_. It is a very interesting relic, and toour eyes appeared of an unusual construction. The corner towers are smalland circular; and the intermediate portion of the outer wall is constructedwith a swell, or a small curvature outwards. I paced the outside, but haveforgotten the measurement. Certainly, it is not more than forty feetsquare. I tried to gain admittance into the interior, but without success,as the person possessing the key was not to be found. I saw enough,however, to convince me that the walls could not be less than twelve feetin thickness.The horses had been some time in readiness, and the fresh postilion seemedto be lost in amazement at the cause of our loitering so long at soinsignificant a place. The day warmed as we pushed on for the far-famed"proud Versailles." The approach, from Houdan, is perhaps not the mostfavourable; although we got peeps of the palace, which gave us ratherelevated notions of its enormous extent. We drove to the _H?tel deBourbon_, an excellent, clean mansion, close to the very fa?ade of thepalace, after passing the H?tel de Ville; and from whence you have anundisturbed view of the broad, wide, direct road to Paris. I bespokedinner, and prepared to lounge. The palace--of which I purposely declinedvisiting the interior--reserving Versailles for a future and entire day'sgratification--is doubtless an immense fabric--of which the fa?ade justmentioned is composed of brick, and assumes any thing but a grand andimposing air: merely because it wants simplicity and uniformity of design.I observed some charming white stone houses, scattered on each side of thiswidely extended chauss?e--or route royale--and, upon the whole, Versaillesappeared to us to be a magnificent and rather interesting spot. Two orthree rows of trees, some forty or fifty generations more ancient thanthose constituting the boulevards at Houdan, formed avenues on each side ofthis noble road; and all appeared life and animation--savouring of theproximity of the metropolis. Carriages without number--chiefly upon hire,were going and returning; and the gaits and dresses of individuals were ofa more studied and of a gayer aspect. At length, we became a littleimpatient for our dinner, and for the moment of our departure. We hired oneof these carriages; which for nine francs, would convey us to the place ofour destination. This appeared to me very reasonable; and after beingextravagant enough to drink Champagne at dinner, to commemorate our nearapproach to the metropolis, we set forward between five and six o'clock,resolving to strain our eyes to the utmost, and to be astonished at everything we saw!--especially as _this_ is considered the most favourableapproach to the capital.The _Ecole Militaire_, to the left, of which Marshal Ney had once the chiefcommand, struck me as a noble establishment. But it was on approaching_S?vre_ that all the bustle and population, attendant upon the immediatevicinity of a great metropolis, became evident. Single-horsed vehicles--inmany of which not fewer than nine persons were pretty closely stowed--threeupon a bench, and three benches under the roof--fiacres, barouches, andcarriages of every description, among which we discovered a great numberfrom our own country--did not fail to occupy our unremitting attention._S?vre_ is a long, rambling, and chiefly single-street town; butpicturesquely situated, on a slope, and ornamented to the left by thewindings of the Seine. We were downright glad to renew our acquaintancewith our old, and long-lost friend, the river Seine; although it appearedto be sadly shorn of its majestic breadth since we had parted with itbefore the walls of Montmorenci castle, in our route to Havre. The newnine-arch bridge at S?vre is a sort of Waterloo bridge in miniature. Uponthe heights, above it, I learnt that there was a beautiful view of theriver in the foreground with Paris in the distance. We passed over the oldbridge, and saw _St. Cloud_ to the left: which of course interested us asthe late residence of Bonaparte, but which, in truth, has nothing beyondthe air of a large respectable country-gentleman's mansion in England. Wepushed on, and began to have distinct perceptions of the great city. Of allthe desirable places of retreat, whether for its elevated situation, orrespectable appearance, or commodious neighbourhood, nothing struck me moreforcibly than the village of PASSY, upon a commanding terrace, to the left;some three or four English miles from Paris--and having a noble view bothof the river and of the city. It is also considered to be remarkablyhealthy; and carriages of every description, are constantly passing thitherto and from Paris.The dome of the _Pantheon_, and the gilded one of the _H?tel desInvalides_, together with the stunted towers of _Notre Dame_, were amongthe chief objects to the right: while the accompaniment of the Seine,afforded a pleasing foreground to this architectural picture in thedistance. But, my friend, I will frankly own to you, that I wasdisappointed ... upon this first glimpse of the GREAT city. In the firstplace, the surrounding country is flat; with the exception of _MountCalvary,_ to the left, which has nothing to do with the metropolitan viewfrom this situation. In the second place, what are the _Pantheon_ and_Notre Dame_ compared with _St. Paul's_ and _Westminster Abbey_?--to saynothing of the vicinity of London, as is connected with the beautifullyundulating ground about Camberwell, Sydenham, Norwood, and. Shooter'sHill--and, on the other side of the water, Hampstead, Highgate andHarrow: again, Wimbledon and Richmond!... What lovely vicinities arethese compared with that of _Mont Martre_? And if you take river sceneryinto the account, what is the _Seine_, in the neighbourhood of Paris,compared with the _Thames_ in that of London? If the almost impenetrablesmoke and filth from coal-fires were charmed away--shew me, I beseechyou, any view of Paris, from this, or from any point of approach, whichshall presume to bear the semblance of comparison with that of London,from the descent from _Shooter's Hill_! The most bewitchedFrenchified-Englishman, in the perfect possession of his eye sight, willnot have the temerity to institute such a comparison. But as you nearthe barriers, your admiration increases. Having got rid of allbackground of country--as you approach the capital--the foregoingobjections vanish. Here the officers of police affected to search ourluggage. They were heartily welcome, and so I told them. This disarmedall suspicion. Accordingly we entered Paris by one of the noblest andone of the most celebrated of its Boulevards--the _Champs Elys?es_. Aswe gained the _Place Louis Quinze_, with the _Thuileries_ in front, withthe _H?tel des Invalides_ (the gilded dome of which latter reflected thestrong rays of a setting sun) to the right--we were much struck withthis combination of architectural splendour: indisputably much superiorto any similar display on the entrance into our own capital.[174]Turning to the left, the _Place Vendome_ and the _Rue de la Paix_, withthe extreme height of the houses, and the stone materials of theirconstruction, completed our admiration. But the _BoulevardsItaliens_--after passing the pillars of the proposed church of _Ste.Madelaine_, and turning to the right--helped to prolong our extremegratification, till we reached the spot whence I am addressing you.Doubtless, at first glance, this is a most splendid and enchanting city.A particular detail must be necessarily reserved, for the next despatch.I shall take all possible pains to make you acquainted with thetreasures of PAST TIMES--in the shape of Manuscripts and printed Books.THE ROYAL LIBRARY has as much astonished me, as the CURATORS of it havecharmed me by their extreme kindness and civility.[175][174] [The above was written in 1818-19. Now, what would be said by a    foreigner, of his first drive from Westminster Bridge, through Regent    Street to the stupendous Pantheon facing the termination of Portland    Place?][175] At this point, the labours of Mons. LICQUET, as my translator, cease;    and I will let him take leave of his task of translation in his own    words. "Ici se termine la tache qui m'a ?t? confi?e. Apr?s avoir    r?fut? franchement tout ce qui m'a sembl? digne de l?tre, je crois    devoir d?clarer, en finissant, que mes observations n'ont jamais eu    _la personne_ pour objet. Je reste persuad?, d'ailleurs, que le coeur    de M.D. est tout-?-fait innocent des ?carts de son esprit. Si l'on    peut le condamner pour le fait, il faudra toujours l'absoudre pour    l'intention...." The _concluding_-sentence need not be copied: it is    bad taste to re-echo the notices of one's own good qualities.    My Norman translator at least takes leave of me with the grace of a    gentleman: although his thrusts have been occasionally direct and    severely intended. The foil which he has used has not always had the    button covered. The candid reader will, however, judge how these    thrusts have been parried; and if the "hits" on the part of my    adversary, have been sometimes "palpable," those of the original    author will not (it is presumed) be deemed feeble or unimpressive.    After all, the sum total of "Errata" scarcely includes THREE of    _substantial moment_: and wishing Mons Licquet "a very good day," I    desire nothing better than to renew our critical coqueting on the    floor of that Library of which he is the "Biblioth?caire en Chef."END OF VOL. I.London: Printed by W. Nicol,Cleveland-row, St. James's.SUPPLEMENT TO VOL. I.OLD POEM ON THE SIEGE OF ROUEN.The city of Rouen makes too considerable a figure in the foregoing pages,and its history, as connected with our own country in the earlier part ofthe fifteenth century, is too interesting, to require any thing in theshape of apology for the matter which the Reader is about to peruse. This"matter" is necessarily incidental to the _present_ edition of the "Tour;"as it is only recently made public. An "_Old English Poem_" on our Henrythe Fifth's "_Siege of Rouen_" is a theme likely to excite the attention ofthe literary Antiquary on _either_ side of the Channel.The late erudite, and ever to be lamented Rev. J.J. Conybeare, successivelyProfessor of the Saxon language, and of English Poetry in the University ofOxford, discovered, in the exhaustless treasures of the Bodleian Library, aportion of the Old English Poem in question: but it was a portion only. Inthe 21st. vol. of the Arch?ologia, Mr. Conybeare gave an account of thisfortunate discovery, and subjoined the poetical fragment. Mr. FrederickMadden, one of the Librarians attached to the MS. department in the BritishMuseum, was perhaps yet more fortunate in the discovery of the portionwhich was lost: and in the 22d. vol. of the _Arch?ologia_, just published,(pp. 350-398), he has annexed an abstract of the remaining fragment, withcopious and learned notes. This fragment had found its way, in a proseattire, into the well-known English MS. Chronicle, called theBRUTE:--usually (but most absurdly) attributed to Caxton. It is not howeverto be found in _all_ the copies of this Chronicle. On the contrary, Mr.Madden, after an examination of several copies of this MS. has found thepoem only in four of them: namely, in two among the Harleian MSS. (Nos.753; 2256--from which _his_ transcript and collation have been made) in onebelonging to Mr. Coke of Holkham, and in a fourth belonging to the _Cotton_Collection:--Galba E. viii. This latter MS. has a very close correspondencewith the _second_ Harl. MS. but is often faulty from errors of the Scribe,See _Gentleman's Magazine, May_, 1829.So much for the history of the discovery of this precious old EnglishPoem--which is allowed to be a contemporaneous production of the time ofthe Siege--namely, A.D. 1418. A word as to its intrinsic worth--from thetestimony of the Critic most competent to appreciate it. "It will beadmitted, I believe, (says Mr. Madden) by all who will take the troubleto compare the various contemporary narratives of the Siege of Rouen,that in point of simplicity, clearness, and minuteness of detail, thereis NO existing document which can COMPARE with the Poem before us. Itsauthenticity is sufficiently established, from the fact of the Author'shaving been an EYEWITNESS of the whole. If we review the names of thoseHistorians who lived at the same period, we shall have abundant reasonto rejoice at so valuable an accession to our present stock ofinformation on the subject." _Arch?ologia_, vol. xxii. p. 353. Thereader shall be no longer detained from a specimen or two of the poemitself, which should seem fully to justify the eulogy of the Critic."On the day after the return of the twelve delegates sent by the City ofRouen to treat with Henry, the Poet proceeds to inform us, that the Kingcaused two tents to be pitched, one for the English Commissioners, and theother for the French. On the English side were appointed the Earl ofWarwick, the Earl of Salisbury, the Lord Fitzhugh, and Sir WalterHungerford, and on the French side, twelve discreet persons were chosen tomeet them. Then says the writer,  'It was a sight of solempnity,  For to behold both party;  To see the rich in their array,  And on the walls the people that lay,  And on our people that were without,  How thick that they walked about;  And the heraudis seemly to seene,  How that they went ay between;  The king's heraudis and pursuivants,  In coats of arms _amyantis_.  The English a beast, the French a flower,  Of Portyngale both castle and tower,  And other coats of diversity,  As lords bearen in their degree.'"As a striking contrast to this display of pomp and splendour is describedthe deplorable condition of those unfortunate inhabitants who lay starvingin the ditches without the walls of the City, deprived both of food andclothing. The affecting and simple relation of our Poet, who was aneye-witness, is written with that display of feeling such a scene mustnaturally have excited, and affords perhaps one of the most favourablepassages in the Poem to compare with the studied narratives of Elmham orLivius. In the first instance we behold misery literally in rags, andhiding herself in silence and obscurity, whilst in the other she isostentatiously paraded before our eyes:  'There men might see a great pity,  A child of two year or three  Go about, and bid his bread,  For Father and mother both lay dead,  And under them the water stood,  And yet they lay crying after food.  Some _storven_ to the death,  And some stopped both eyen and breath,  And some crooked in the knees,  And as lean as any trees,  And women holding in their arm  A dead child, and nothing warm,  And children sucking on the pap  Within a dead woman's lap.'On Friday the 20th of January, King Henry V. made his public entry intoRouen. His personal appearance is thus described:  'He rode upon a brown steed,  Of black damask was his weed,  A _Peytrelle_ of gold full bright  About his neck hung down right,  And a pendant behind him did honge  Unto the earth, it was so long.  And they that never before him did see,  They knew by the cheer which was he.'"With the accustomed, but mistaken, piety for which Henry was everdistinguished, he first proceeded to the monastery, where he alighted fromhis charger, and was met by the chaplains of his household, who walkedbefore him, chanting _Quis est magnus Dominus?_ After the celebration ofmass, the king repaired to the Castle, where he took up his abode. By thistermination of a siege, which, for its duration and the horrors itproduced, is perhaps without a parallel in ancient or modern times, thecity was again plentifully supplied with provisions, and recovered theshock so tedious and afflicting a contest had occasioned:  'And thus our gracious liege  Made an end of his siege;  And all that have heard this reading,  To his bliss Christ you bring,  That for us died upon a tree,  Amen say we all, _pur charite!_'The Duke of Exeter is appointed Governor of the City, and ordered by Henryto take possession of it the same night. The Duke mounts his horse, andrides strait to the Port de Bevesyne or Beauvais, attended by a retinue, tocarry the commands of his sovereign into execution. His Entr?, and thetruly miserable condition of the besieged, together with the imposingappearance of Henry, shall now be described in the language of the poet.  Thanne the duke of Excestre withoute bode  Toke his hors and forth he rode,  To bevesyne[E] that porte so stronge,  That he hadde ley bifore so longe,  To that gate sone he kam,[F]  And with hym many a worthy[G] manne.  There was neying of many a stede,  And schynyng of many a gay wede,  There was many a getoun[H] gay,  With mychille[I] and grete aray.  And whanne the gate was openyd there,  And thay weren[J] redy into fare,  Trumpis[K] blewgh her bemys[L] of bras,  Pipis and clarionys forsothe ther was,  And as thay entrid thay gaf a schowte  With her[M] voyce that was fulle stowte,  'Seint George! seint George!' thay criden[N] on height,  And seide, 'welcome oure kynges righte.'  The Frensshe pepulle of that Cite  Were gederid by thousandes, hem to see.  Thay criden[N] alle welcome in fere,  'In siche tyme mote ye entre here,  Plesyng to God that it may be,  And to vs pees and vnyte.'  And of that pepulle, to telle the trewthe,  It was a sighte of fulle grete ruthe.  Mykelle of that folke therynne  Thay weren[O] but verrey bonys and skynne.  With eyen holowgh and[P] nose scharpe,  Vnnethe thay myght brethe or carpe,  For her colowris was[Q] wan as lede,  Not like to lyue but sone ben dede.

There men myght see an[T] exampleyre,  How fode makith the pepulle faire.[U]  In euery strete summe lay dede,  And hundriddis krying aftir brede.  And aftir long many a day,  Thay deyde as[V] faste as[W] they myght be lad away.  Into[X] that way God hem wisse,  That thay may come to his blisse! amen.  Now[Y] wille y more spelle,  And of the duke of exestre to[Z] telle.  To that Castelle firste he rode,  And sythen[AA] the Cite alle abrode;  Lengthe and brede he it mette,  And rich baneris he[AB] vp sette.  Vpon the porte seint Hillare  A Baner of the Trynyte.  And at[AC] the port Kaux he sette evene  A baner of the quene of heven.  And at[AD] port martvile he vppyght   Of seint George a baner bryght.  He sette vpon the Castelle to[AE] stonde  The armys of Fr[a]unce and Englond.  And on the Friday in the mornynge  Into that Cite come oure kynge.  And alle the Bisshoppis in her aray,  And vij. abbottis with Crucchis[AF] gay;  xlij.[AG] crossis ther were of Religioune[AH],  And seculere, and alle thay went a precessioun,  Agens that prince withoute the toune,  And euery Cros as thay stode  He blessid hem with milde mode,  And holy water with her hande  Thay gaf the prince of oure lande.  And at[AI] the porte Kaux so wide  He in passid withoute[AJ] pride;  Withoute pipe or bemys blaste,  Our kyng worthyly he in paste.  And as a conquerour in his righte  Thankyng[AK] euer god almyghte;  And alle the pepulle in that Citie  'Wilcome our[AL] lorde,' thay seide, 'so fre!  Wilcome into[AM] thyne owne righte,  As it is the[AN] wille of[AO] god almyght.'  With that thay kryde alle _'nowelle!_'  Os[AP] heighe as thay myght yelle.  He rode vpon a browne stede,  Of blak damaske was his wede.  A peytrelle[AQ] of golde fulle bryght  Aboute his necke hynge[AR] doun right,  And a pendaunte behynd him dide[AS] honge  Vnto the erthe, it was so longe,  And thay that neuer before hym dide[AT] see,  Thay knew by chere[u] wiche was he.  To the mynster dide he fare,  And of his horse he lighte there.  His chapelle[AU] mette hym at[AV] the dore there,  And wente bifore[AW] hym alle in fere,  And songe a response[AX] fulle glorivs,  _Quis est magnus dominus_.  Messe he hirde and offrid thoo,  And thanne to the Castelle dide he goo.  That is a place of rialte,  And a paleis of grete beaute.  There he hym[AY] loggid in the Toune,  With rialle and grete renoune.  And the[AZ] cite dide faste encrece  Of brede and wyne, fisshe, and fflesshe.[BA]  And thus oure gracious liege  Made an ende of his seege.  And alle that[BB] haue hirde this redynge[BC]  To his[BD] blisse criste you brynge,  That for vs deide vpon[BE] a tre,  Amen sey[BF] we alle, pur cherite!_There was many a getoun gay_.] The following particulars relative to the_getoun_ appear in MS. Harl. 838. "Euery baronet euery estat aboue hym shalhave hys baner displeyd in y'e field yf he be chyef capteyn, euery knyghthis penoun, euery squier or gentleman hys _getoun_ or standard." "Item, y'emeyst lawfully fle fro y'e standard and _getoun_, but not fro y'e baner nepenon.". "Nota, a stremer shal stand in a top of a schyp or in y'efore-castel: a stremer shal be slyt and so shal a standard as welle as a_getoun_: a _getoun_ shal berr y'e length of ij yardes, a standard of iiior 4 yardes, and a stremer of xii. xx. xl. or lx. yardes longe."This account is confirmed by MS. Harl. 2258, and Lansd. 225. f. 431. asquoted by Mr. Nicholas, in the Retrosp. Rev. vol. i. N.S. The former ofthese MSS. states: Euery standard and _Guydhome_ [whence the etymology ofthe word is obvious] to have in the chief the crosse of St. George, to beslitte at the ende, and to conteyne the creste or supporter, with theposey, worde, and devise of the owner." It adds, that "a guydhome must betwo yardes and a halfe, or three yardes longe." This rule may sometimeshave been neglected, at least by artists, for in a bill of expences for theEarl of Warwick, dated July 1437, and printed by Dugdale, (Warw. p. 327.)we find the following entry; "Item, a _gyton_ for the shippe of viij.yerdis long, poudrid full of raggid staves, for the lymnyng andworkmanship, ijs." The Grant of a _guydon_ made in 1491 to Hugh Vaughan, ispreserved in the College of Arms.

When the note relating to itwas written, I could, not place my hand upon a Brochure (in my possession)published at Rouen in 1823,[176] containing an archaeological descriptionof this Statue by M. Revet, and a scientific account of its componentparts, by M. Houton La Billardi?re, Professor of Chemistry at Rouen. Theformer embodied his remarks in two letters addressed to the Prefect of theLower Seine. A print of the figure in its then extremely mutilated state,is prefixed; but its omission would have been no great drawback to thepublication--which, in its details, appears to be ingenious, learned, andsatisfactory. The highest praise is given to the Statue, as a work of artof the second century.[177] Its _identity_ seems to be yet a subject ofdisputation:--but M. Revet considers it as "the representation of someidolatrous divinity." The opinion of its being a representation of Bacchus,or of Apollo, or of a Constellation, he thinks might be regulated by adiscovery of some emblem, or attribute, found in the vicinity of theStatue. Two other plates--lithographised--relating to explanations of thepieces of the Statue, close this interesting performance.[176] "_Description de la, Statue Fruste, en Bronze Dor?, trouv?e a    Lillebonne &c.

Rouen,_ 1823. pp. 56.[177] Other details induce me to fix the period of its completion towards    the end of the second century: and after the unheard of difficulties    which the artist had to overcome, one would scarcely be believed if    one said that every thing is executed in a high state of perfection."    p. 34.BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INDEX.INDEX OF MANUSCRIPTS, AND OF PRINTED BOOKS,DESCRIBED, QUOTED, OR REFERRED TO.

Your soul is as a moonlit landscape fair,        Peopled with maskers delicate and dim,     That play on lutes and dance and have an air        Of being sad in their fantastic trim.     The while they celebrate in minor strain        Triumphant love, effective enterprise,     They have an air of knowing all is vain,--        And through the quiet moonlight their songs rise,     The melancholy moonlight, sweet and lone,        That makes to dream the birds upon the tree,     And in their polished basins of white stone        The fountains tall to sob with ecstasy.SUR L'HERBE.     "The abbe rambles."--"You, marquis,        Have put your wig on all awry."--     "This wine of Cyprus kindles me        Less, my Camargo, than your eye!"     "My passion"--"Do, mi, sol, la, si."--        "Abbe, your villany lies bare."--     "Mesdames, I climb up yonder tree        And fetch a star down, I declare."     "Let each kiss his own lady, then        The others."--"Would that I were, too,     A lap-dog!"--"Softly, gentlemen!"--        "Do, mi."--"The moon!"--"Hey, how d'ye do?"L' ALLEE.     Powdered and rouged as in the sheepcotes' day,     Fragile 'mid her enormous ribbon bows,     Along the shaded alley, where green grows     The moss on the old seats, she wends her way     With mincing graces and affected airs,     Such as more oft a petted parrot wears.     Her long gown with the train is blue; the fan     She spreads between her jewelled fingers slim     Is merry with a love-scene, of so dim     Suggestion, her eyes smile the while they scan.     Blonde; dainty nose; plump, cherry lips, divine     With pride unconscious.--Subtler, certainly,     Than is the mouche there set to underline     The rather foolish brightness of the eye.A LA PROMENADE.     The milky sky, the hazy, slender trees,        Seem smiling on the light costumes we wear,--        Our gauzy floating veils that have an air     Of wings, our satins fluttering in the breeze.     And in the marble bowl the ripples gleam,        And through the lindens of the avenue        The sifted golden sun comes to us blue     And dying, like the sunshine of a dream.     Exquisite triflers and deceivers rare,        Tender of heart, but little tied by vows,        Deliciously we dally 'neath the boughs,     And playfully the lovers plague the fair.     Receiving, should they overstep a point,        A buffet from a hand absurdly small,        At which upon a gallant knee they fall     To kiss the little finger's littlest joint.     And as this is a shocking liberty,        A frigid glance rewards the daring swain,--        Not quite o'erbalancing with its disdain     The red mouth's reassuring clemency.LE FAUNE.     An ancient terra-cotta Faun,        A laughing note in 'mid the green,     Grins at us from the central lawn,        With secret and sarcastic mien.     It is that he foresees, perchance,        A bad end to the moments dear     That with gay music and light dance        Have led us, pensive pilgrims, here.MANDOLINE.     The courtly serenaders,        The beauteous listeners,     Sit idling 'neath the branches        A balmy zephyr stirs.     It's Tircis and Aminta,        Clitandre,--ever there!--     Damis, of melting sonnets        To many a frosty fair.     Their trailing flowery dresses,        Their fine beflowered coats,     Their elegance and lightness,        And shadows blue,--all floats     And mingles,--circling, wreathing,        In moonlight opaline,     While through the zephyr's harping        Tinkles the mandoline.L'AMOUR PAR TERRE     The wind the other night blew down the Love        That in the dimmest corner of the park        So subtly used to smile, bending his arc,     And sight of whom did us so deeply move     One day! The other night's wind blew him down!        The marble dust whirls in the morning breeze.        Oh, sad to view, o'erblotted by the trees,     There on the base, the name of great renown!     Oh, sad to view the empty pedestal!        And melancholy fancies come and go        Across my dream, whereon a day of woe     Foreshadowed is--I know what will befall!     Oh, sad!--And you are saddened also, Sweet,        Are not you, by this scene? although your eye        Pursues the gold and purple butterfly     That flutters o'er the wreck strewn at our feet.[Illustration: "En Sourdine"]EN SOURDINE     Tranquil in the twilight dense        By the spreading branches made,     Let us breathe the influence        Of the silence and the shade.     Let your heart melt into mine,        And your soul reach out to me,     'Mid the languors of the pine        And the sighing arbute-tree.     Close your eyes, your hands let be        Folded on your slumbering heart,     From whose hold all treachery        Drive forever, and all art.     Let us with the hour accord!        Let us let the gentle wind,     Rippling in the sunburnt sward,        Bring us to a patient mind!     And when Night across the air        Shall her solemn shadow fling,     Touching voice of our despair,        Long the nightingale shall sing.COLLOQUE SENTIMENTAL     In the deserted park, silent and vast,     Erewhile two shadowy glimmering figures passed.     Their lips were colorless, and dead their eyes;     Their words were scarce more audible than sighs.     In the deserted park, silent and vast,     Two spectres conjured up the buried past.     "Our ancient ecstasy, do you recall?"     "Why, pray, should I remember it at all?"     "Does still your heart at mention of me glow?     Do still you see my soul in slumber?" "No!"     "Ah, blessed, blissful days when our lips met!     You loved me so!" "Quite likely,--I forget."     "How sweet was hope, the sky how blue and fair!"     "The sky grew black, the hope became despair."     Thus walked they 'mid the frozen weeds, these dead,     And Night alone o'erheard the things they said.  La Bonne ChansonSINCE SHADE RELENTS     Since shade relents, since 'tis indeed the day,        Since hope I long had deemed forever flown,     Wings back to me that call on her and pray,        Since so much joy consents to be my own,--     The dark designs all I relinquish here,        And all the evil dreams. Ah, done am I     Above all with the narrowed lips, the sneer,        The heartless wit that laughed where one should sigh.     Away, clenched fist and bosom's angry swell,        That knave and fool at every turn abound.     Away, hard unforgivingness! Farewell,        Oblivion in a hated brewage found!     For I mean, now a Being of the Morn        Has shed across my night excelling rays     Of love at once immortal and newborn,--        By favor of her smile, her glance, her grace,     I mean by you upheld, O gentle hand,        Wherein mine trembles,--led, sweet eyes, by you,     To walk straight, lie the path o'er mossy land        Or barren waste that rocks and pebbles strew.     Yes, calm I mean to walk through life, and straight,        Patient of all, unanxious of the goal,     Void of all envy, violence, or hate        It shall be duty done with cheerful soul.     And as I may, to lighten the long way,        Go singing airs ingenuous and brave,     She'll listen to me graciously, I say,--        And, verily, no other heaven I crave.[Illustration: "Avant Que Tu T'en Ailles."]BEFORE YOUR LIGHT QUITE FAIL     Before your light quite fail,     Already paling star,               (The quail     Sings in the thyme afar!)     Turn on the poet's eyes     That love makes overrun--               (See rise     The lark to meet the sun!)     Your glance, that presently     Must drown in the blue morn;               (What glee     Amid the rustling corn!)     Then flash my message true     Down yonder,--far away!--               (The dew     Lies sparkling on the hay.)     Across what visions seek     The Dear One slumbering still.               (Quick, quick!     The sun has reached the hill!)  O'ER THE WOOD'S BROW     O'er the wood's brow,        Pale, the moon stares;     In every bough        Wandering airs     Faintly suspire....     O heart's-desire!     Two willow-trees        Waver and weep,     One in the breeze,        One in the deep     Glass of the stream....     Dream we our dream!     An infinite        Resignedness     Rains where the white        Mists opalesce     In the moon-shower....     Stay, perfect hour!THE SCENE BEHIND THE CARRIAGE WINDOW-PANES     The scene behind the carriage window-panes     Goes flitting past in furious flight; whole plains     With streams and harvest-fields and trees and blue     Are swallowed by the whirlpool, whereinto     The telegraph's slim pillars topple o'er,     Whose wires look strangely like a music-score.     A smell of smoke and steam, a horrid din     As of a thousand clanking chains that pin     A thousand giants that are whipped and howl,--     And, suddenly, long hoots as of an owl.     What is it all to me? Since in mine eyes     The vision lingers that beatifies,     Since still the soft voice murmurs in mine ear,     And since the Name, so sweet, so high, so dear,     Pure pivot of this madding whirl, prevails     Above the brutal clangor of the rails?  THE ROSY HEARTH, THE LAMPLIGHT'S NARROW BEAM     The rosy hearth, the lamplight's narrow beam,     The meditation that is rather dream,     With looks that lose themselves in cherished looks;     The hour of steaming tea and banished books;     The sweetness of the evening at an end,     The dear fatigue, and right to rest attained,     And worshipped expectation of the night,--     Oh, all these things, in unrelenting flight,     My dream pursues through all the vain delays,     Impatient of the weeks, mad at the days!  IT SHALL BE, THEN, UPON A SUMMER'S DAY     It shall be, then, upon a summer's day:        The sun, my joy's accomplice, bright shall shine,        And add, amid your silk and satin fine,     To your dear radiance still another ray;     The heavens, like a sumptuous canopy,        Shall shake out their blue folds to droop and trail        About our happy brows, that shall be pale     With so much gladness, such expectancy;     And when day closes, soft shall be the air        That in your snowy veils, caressing, plays,        And with soft-smiling eyes the stars shall gaze     Benignantly upon the wedded pair.  Romances sans ParolesAriettes OublieesIl pleut doucement sur la ville.--ARTHUR RIMBAUD     It weeps in my heart     As it rains on the town.     What is this dull smart     Possessing my heart?     Soft sound of the rain     On the ground and the roofs!     To a heart in pain,     O the song of the rain!     It weeps without cause     In my heart-sick heart.     In her faith, what? no flaws?     This grief has no cause.     'Tis sure the worst woe     To know not wherefore     My heart suffers so     Without joy or woe.Son joyeux, importun, d'un clavecin sonore.--PETRUS BOREL     The keyboard, over which two slim hands float,     Shines vaguely in the twilight pink and gray,     Whilst with a sound like wings, note after note     Takes flight to form a pensive little lay     That strays, discreet and charming, faint, remote,     About the room where perfumes of Her stray.     What is this sudden quiet cradling me     To that dim ditty's dreamy rise and fall?     What do you want with me, pale melody?     What is it that you want, ghost musical     That fade toward the window waveringly     A little open on the garden small?[Illustration: "Le Piano Que Baise Une Main Frele"]Oh, heavy, heavy my despair,     Because, because of One so fair.     My misery knows no allay,     Although my heart has come away.     Although my heart, although my soul,     Have fled the fatal One's control.     My misery knows no allay,     Although my heart has come away.     My heart, the too, too feeling one,     Says to my soul, "Can it be done,     "Can it be done, too feeling heart,     That we from her shall live apart?"     My soul says to my heart, "Know I     What this strange pitfall should imply,     "That we, though far from her, are near,     Yea, present, though in exile here?"     Le rossignol qui du haut d'une branche se regarde     dedans, croit etre tombe dans la riviere. Il est au sommet     d'un chene, et toutefois il a peur de se noyer.                                        CYRANO DE BERGERAC.     The trees' reflection in the misty stream        Dies off in livid steam;     Whilst up among the actual boughs, forlorn,        The tender wood-doves mourn.     How wan the face, O traveller, this wan        Gray landscape looked upon;     And how forlornly in the high tree-tops        Lamented thy drowned hopes!Paysages BelgesBRUXELLES     Hills and fences hurry by     Blent in greenish-rosy flight,     And the yellow carriage-light     Blurs all to the half-shut eye.     Slowly turns the gold to red     O'er the humble darkening vales;     Little trees that flatly spread,     Where some feeble birdling wails.     Scarcely sad, so mild and fair     This enfolding Autumn seems;     All my moody languor dreams,     Cradled by the gentle air.Birds in the Night                      I     You were not over-patient with me, dear;        This want of patience one must rightly rate:     You are so young! Youth ever was severe        And variable and inconsiderate!     You had not all the needful kindness, no;        Nor should one be amazed, unhappily:     You're very young, cold sister mine, and so        'Tis natural you should unfeeling be!     Behold me therefore ready to forgive;        Not gay, of course! but doing what I can     To bear up bravely,--deeply though I grieve        To be, through you, the most unhappy man.                 II     But you will own that I was in the right        When in my downcast moods I used to say     That your sweet eyes, my hope, once, and delight!        Were come to look like eyes that will betray.     It was an evil lie, you used to swear,        And your glance, which was lying, dear, would flame,--     Poor fire, near out, one stirs to make it flare!--        And in your soft voice you would say, "Je t'aime!"     Alas! that one should clutch at happiness        In sense's, season's, everything's despite!--     But 'twas an hour of gleeful bitterness        When I became convinced that I was right!                   III     And wherefore should I lay my heart-wounds bare?        You love me not,--an end there, lady mine;     And as I do not choose that one shall dare        To pity,--I must suffer without sign.     Yes, suffer! For I loved you well, did I,--        But like a loyal soldier will I stand     Till, hurt to death, he staggers off to die,        Still filled with love for an ungrateful land.     O you that were my Beauty and my Own,        Although from you derive all my mischance,     Are not you still my Home, then, you alone,        As young and mad and beautiful as France?                 IV     Now I do not intend--what were the gain?--        To dwell with streaming eyes upon the past;     But yet my love which you may think lies slain,        Perhaps is only wide awake at last.     My love, perhaps,--which now is memory!--        Although beneath your blows it cringe and cry     And bleed to will, and must, as I foresee,        Still suffer long and much before it die,--     Judges you justly when it seems aware        Of some not all banal compunction,     And of your memory in its despair        Reproaching you, "Ah, fi! it was ill done!"                 V     I see you still. I softly pushed the door--        As one o'erwhelmed with weariness you lay;     But O light body love should soon restore,        You bounded up, tearful at once and gay.     O what embraces, kisses sweet and wild!        Myself, from brimming eyes I laughed to you     Those moments, among all, O lovely child,        Shall be my saddest, but my sweetest, too.     I will remember your smile, your caress,        Your eyes, so kind that day,--exquisite snare!--     Yourself, in fine, whom else I might not bless,     Only as they appeared, not as they were.                 VI     I see you still! Dressed in a summer dress,        Yellow and white, bestrewn with curtain-flowers;     But you had lost the glistening laughingness        Of our delirious former loving hours.     The eldest daughter and the little wife        Spoke plainly in your bearing's least detail,--     Already 'twas, alas! our altered life        That stared me from behind your dotted veil.     Forgiven be! And with no little pride        I treasure up,--and you, no doubt, see why,--     Remembrance of the lightning to one side        That used to flash from your indignant eye!                 VII     Some moments, I'm the tempest-driven bark        That runs dismasted mid the hissing spray,     And seeing not Our Lady through the dark        Makes ready to be drowned, and kneels to pray.     Some moments, I'm the sinner at his end,        That knows his doom if he unshriven go,     And losing hope of any ghostly friend,        Sees Hell already gape, and feels it glow.     Oh, but! Some moments, I've the spirit stout        Of early Christians in the lion's care,     That smile to Jesus witnessing, without        A nerve's revolt, the turning of a hair!  AquarellesGREEN     See, blossoms, branches, fruit, leaves I have brought,        And then my heart that for you only sighs;     With those white hands of yours, oh, tear it not,        But let the poor gift prosper in your eyes.     The dew upon my hair is still undried,--        The morning wind strikes chilly where it fell.     Suffer my weariness here at your side        To dream the hour that shall it quite dispel.     Allow my head, that rings and echoes still        With your last kiss, to lie upon your breast,     Till it recover from the stormy thrill,--        And let me sleep a little, since you rest.  SPLEEN     The roses were so red, so red,        The ivies altogether black.     If you but merely turn your head,        Beloved, all my despairs come back!     The sky was over-sweet and blue,        Too melting green the sea did show.     I always fear,--if you but knew!--        From your dear hand some killing blow.     Weary am I of holly-tree        And shining box and waving grass     Upon the tame unending lea,--        And all and all but you, alas!STREETS            Let's dance the jig!     Above all else I loved her eyes,     More clear than stars of cloudless skies,     And arch and mischievous and wise.            Let's dance the jig!     So skilfully would she proceed     To make a lover's bare heart bleed,     That it was beautiful indeed!            Let's dance the jig!     But keenlier have I relished     The kisses of her mouth so red     Since to my heart she has been dead.            Let's dance the jig!     The circumstances great and small,--     Words, moments... I recall, recall     It is my treasure among all.            Let's dance the jig!  Sagesse     WHAT SAYST THOU, TRAVELLER, OF ALL THOU SAW'ST AFAR?     What sayst thou, traveller, of all thou saw'st afar?        On every tree hangs boredom, ripening to its fall,     Didst gather it, thou smoking yon thy sad cigar,        Black, casting an incongruous shadow on the wall?     Thine eyes are just as dead as ever they have been,        Unchanged is thy grimace, thy dolefulness is one,     Thou mind'st one of the wan moon through the rigging seen,        The wrinkled sea beneath the golden morning sun,     The ancient graveyard with new gravestones every day,--        But, come, regale us with appropriate detail,     Those disillusions weeping at the fountains, say,        Those new disgusts, just like their brothers, littered stale,     Those women! Say the glare, the identical dismay        Of ugliness and evil, always, in all lands,     And say Love, too,--and Politics, moreover, say,        With ink-dishonored blood upon their shameless hands.     And then, above all else, neglect not to recite        Thy proper feats, thou dragging thy simplicity     Wherever people love, wherever people fight,        In such a sad and foolish kind, in verity!     Has that dull innocence been punished as it should?        What say'st thou? Man is hard,--but woman? And thy tears,     Who has been drinking? And into what ear so good        Dost pour thy woes for it to pour in other ears?     Ah, others! ah, thyself! Gulled with such curious ease,        That used to dream (Doth not the soul with laughter fill?)     One knows not what poetic, delicate decease,--        Thou sort of angel with the paralytic will!     But now what are thy plans, thine aims? Art thou of might?        Or has long shedding tears disqualified thy heart?     The tree is scarcely hardy, judging it at sight,        And by thy looks no topping conqueror thou art.     So awkward, too! With the additional offence        Of being now a sort of dazed idyllic bard     That poses in a window, contemplating thence        The silly noon-day sky with an impressed regard.     So totally the same in this extreme decay!        But in thy place a being with some sense, pardy,     Would wish at least to lead the dance, since he must pay        The fiddlers,--at some risk of flutt'ring passers-by!     Canst not, by rummaging within thy consciousness,        Find some bright vice to bare, as 't were a flashing sword?     Some gay, audacious vice, which wield with dexterousness,        And make to shine, and shoot red lightnings Heavenward!     Hast one, or more? If more, the better! And plunge in,        And bravely lay about thee, indiscriminate,     And wear that face of indolence that masks the grin        Of hate at once full-feasted and insatiate.     Not well to be a dupe in this good universe,        Where there is nothing to allure in happiness     Save in it wriggle aught of shameful and perverse,--        And not to be a dupe, one must be merciless!     --Ah, human wisdom, ah, new things have claimed mine eyes,        And of that past--of weary recollection!--     Thy voice described, for still more sinister advice,        All I remember is the evil I have done.     In all the curious movements of my sad career,        Of others and myself, the chequered road I trod,     Of my accounted sorrows, good and evil cheer,        I nothing have retained except the grace of God!     If I am punished, 'tis most fit I should be so;        Played to its end is mortal man's and woman's role,--     But steadfastly I hope I too one day shall know        The peace and pardon promised every Christian soul.     Well not to be a dupe in this world of a day,        But not to be one in the world that hath no end,     That which it doth behoove the soul to be and stay        Is merciful, not merciless,--deluded friend.THE FALSE FAIR DAYS     The false fair days have flamed the livelong day,     And still they flicker in the brazen West.     Cast down thine eyes, poor soul, shut out the unblest:     A deadliest temptation. Come away.     All day they flashed in flakes of fire, that lay     The vintage low upon the hill's green breast,     The harvest low,--and o'er that faithfullest,     The blue sky ever beckoning, shed dismay.     Oh, clasp thy hands, grow pale, and turn again!     If all the future savoured of the past?     If the old insanity were on its way?     Those memories, must each anew be slain?     One fierce assault, the best, no doubt, the last!     Go pray against the gathering storm, go pray!GIVE EAR UNTO THE GENTLE LAY     Give ear unto the gentle lay     That's only sad that it may please;     It is discreet, and light it is:     A whiff of wind o'er buds in May.     The voice was known to you (and dear?),     But it is muffled latterly     As is a widow,--still, as she     It doth its sorrow proudly bear,     And through the sweeping mourning veil     That in the gusts of Autumn blows,     Unto the heart that wonders, shows     Truth like a star now flash, now fail.     It says,--the voice you knew again!--     That kindness, goodness is our life,     And that of envy, hatred, strife,     When death is come, shall naught remain.     It says how glorious to be     Like children, without more delay,     The tender gladness it doth say     Of peace not bought with victory.     Accept the voice,--ah, hear the whole     Of its persistent, artless strain:     Naught so can soothe a soul's own pain,     As making glad another soul!     It pines in bonds but for a day,     The soul that without murmur bears....     How unperplexed, how free it fares!     Oh, listen to the gentle lay!I'VE SEEN AGAIN THE ONE CHILD: VERILY     I've seen again the One child: verily,     I felt the last wound open in my breast,     The last, whose perfect torture doth attest     That on some happy day I too shall die!     Good icy arrow, piercing thoroughly!     Most timely came it from their dreams to wrest     The sluggish scruples laid too long to rest,--     And all my Christian blood hymned fervently.     I still hear, still I see! O worshipped rule     Of God! I know at last how comfortful     To hear and see! I see, I hear alway!     O innocence, O hope! Lowly and mild,     How I shall love you, sweet hands of my child,     Whose task shall be to close our eyes one day!  "SON, THOU MUST LOVE ME! SEE--" MY SAVIOUR SAID     "Son, thou must love me! See--" my Saviour said,     "My heart that glows and bleeds, my wounded side,     My hurt feet that the Magdalene, wet-eyed,     Clasps kneeling, and my tortured arms outspread     "To bear thy sins. Look on the cross, stained red!     The nails, the sponge, that, all, thy soul shall guide     To love on earth where flesh thrones in its pride,     My Body and Blood alone, thy Wine and Bread.     "Have I not loved thee even unto death,     O brother mine, son in the Holy Ghost?     Have I not suffered, as was writ I must,     "And with thine agony sobbed out my breath?     Hath not thy nightly sweat bedewed my brow,     O lamentable friend that seek'st me now?"[Illustration:  "Mon Dieu M'a Dit."]  HOPE SHINES--AS IN A STABLE A WISP OF STRAW     Hope shines--as in a stable a wisp of straw.     Fear not the wasp drunk with his crazy flight!     Through some chink always, see, the moted light!     Propped on your hand, you dozed--But let me draw     Cool water from the well for you, at least,     Poor soul! There, drink! Then sleep. See, I remain,     And I will sing a slumberous refrain,     And you shall murmur like a child appeased.     Noon strikes. Approach not, Madam, pray, or call....     He sleeps. Strange how a woman's light footfall     Re-echoes through the brains of grief-worn men!     Noon strikes. I bade them sprinkle in the room.     Sleep on! Hope shines--a pebble in the gloom.     --When shall the Autumn rose re-blossom,--when?SLEEP, DARKSOME, DEEP     Sleep, darksome, deep,        Doth on me fall:     Vain hopes all, sleep,        Sleep, yearnings all!     Lo, I grow blind!        Lo, right and wrong     Fade to my mind....        O sorry song!     A cradle, I,        Rocked in a grave:     Speak low, pass by,        Silence I crave![Illustration: Le Ciel et Les Toits.]THE SKY-BLUE SMILES ABOVE THE ROOF     The sky-blue smiles above the roof            Its tenderest;     A green tree rears above the roof            Its waving crest.     The church-bell in the windless sky            Peaceably rings,     A skylark soaring in the sky            Endlessly sings.     My God, my God, all life is there,            Simple and sweet;     The soothing bee-hive murmur there            Comes from the street!     What have you done, O you that weep            In the glad sun,--     Say, with your youth, you man that weep,            What have you done?  IT IS YOU     It is you, it is you, poor better thoughts!     The needful hope, shame for the ancient blots,     Heart's gentleness with mind's severity,     And vigilance, and calm, and constancy,     And all!--But slow as yet, though well awake;     Though sturdy, shy; scarce able yet to break     The spell of stifling night and heavy dreams.     One comes after the other, and each seems     Uncouther, and all fear the moonlight cold.     "Thus, sheep when first they issue from the fold,     Come,--one, then two, then three. The rest delay,     With lowered heads, in stupid, wondering way,     Waiting to do as does the one that leads.     He stops, they stop in turn, and lay their heads     Across his back, simply, not knowing why."*     Your shepherd, O my fair flock, is not I,--     It is a better, better far, who knows     The reasons, He that so long kept you close,     But timely with His own hand set you free.     Him follow,--light His staff. And I shall be,     Beneath his voice still raised to comfort you,     I shall be, I, His faithful dog, and true.                * Dante, Purgatorio.  'TIS THE FEAST OF CORN     'Tis the feast of corn, 'tis the feast of bread,        On the dear scene returned to, witnessed again!     So white is the light o'er the reapers shed        Their shadows fall pink on the level grain.     The stalked gold drops to the whistling flight        Of the scythes, whose lightning dives deep, leaps clear;     The plain, labor-strewn to the confines of sight,        Changes face at each instant, gay and severe.     All pants, all is effort and toil 'neath the sun,        The stolid old sun, tranquil ripener of wheat,     Who works o'er our haste imperturbably on        To swell the green grape yon, turning it sweet.     Work on, faithful sun, for the bread and the wine,        Feed man with the milk of the earth, and bestow     The frank glass wherein unconcern laughs divine,--        Ye harvesters, vintagers, work on, aglow!     For from the flour's fairest, and from the vine's best,        Fruit of man's strength spread to earth's uttermost,     God gathers and reaps, to His purposes blest,        The Flesh and the Blood for the chalice and host!Jadis et NaguereJadisPROLOGUE     Off, be off, now, graceless pack:     Get you gone, lost children mine:     Your release is earned in fine:     The Chimaera lends her back.

Spread your rustling wings, arise,     Little griefs, little delights,     Hopes, despairs, dreams foul and fair,     All!--renounced since yesterday     By my heart that quests elsewhere....     Ite, aegri somnia!LANGUEUR     I am the Empire in the last of its decline,     That sees the tall, fair-haired Barbarians pass,--the while     Composing indolent acrostics, in a style     Of gold, with languid sunshine dancing in each line.     The solitary soul is heart-sick with a vile     Ennui. Down yon, they say, War's torches bloody shine.     Alas, to be so faint of will, one must resign     The chance of brave adventure in the splendid file,--     Of death, perchance! Alas, so lagging in desire!     Ah, all is drunk! Bathyllus, hast done laughing, pray?     Ah, all is drunk,--all eaten! Nothing more to say!     Alone, a vapid verse one tosses in the fire;     Alone, a somewhat thievish slave neglecting one;     Alone, a vague disgust of all beneath the sun!Naguere[Illustration: "Crepuscule du Soir Mystique."]PROLOGUE     Glimm'ring twilight things are these,     Visions of the end of night.

(Many have mocked, without remembering     That laughter oft is a misguiding thing,     This explanation of night's mystery.)     Now all that born beneath Saturnus be,--     Red planet, to the necromancer dear,--     Inherit, ancient magic-books make clear,     Good share of spleen, good share of wretchedness.     Imagination, wakeful, vigorless,     In them makes the resolves of reason vain.     The blood within them, subtle as a bane,     Burning as lava, scarce, flows ever fraught     With sad ideals that ever come to naught.     Such must Saturnians suffer, such must die,--     If so that death destruction doth imply,--     Their lives being ordered in this dismal sense     By logic of a malign Influence.MelancholiaNEVERMORE     Remembrance, what wilt thou with me? The year     Declined; in the still air the thrush piped clear,     The languid sunshine did incurious peer     Among the thinned leaves of the forest sere.     We were alone, and pensively we strolled,     With straying locks and fancies, when, behold     Her turn to let her thrilling gaze enfold,     And ask me in her voice of living gold,     Her fresh young voice, "What was thy happiest day?"     I smiled discreetly for all answer, and     Devotedly I kissed her fair white hand.     --Ah, me! The earliest flowers, how sweet are they!     And in how exquisite a whisper slips     The earliest "Yes" from well-beloved lips!  APRES TROIS ANS     When I had pushed the narrow garden-door,     Once more I stood within the green retreat;     Softly the morning sunshine lighted it,     And every flow'r a humid spangle wore.     Nothing is changed. I see it all once more:     The vine-clad arbor with its rustic seat....     The waterjet still plashes silver sweet,     The ancient aspen rustles as of yore.     The roses throb as in a bygone day,     As they were wont, the tall proud lilies sway.     Each bird that lights and twitters is a friend.     I even found the Flora standing yet,     Whose plaster crumbles at the alley's end,     --Slim, 'mid the foolish scent of mignonette.  MON REVE FAMILIER     Oft do I dream this strange and penetrating dream:     An unknown woman, whom I love, who loves me well,     Who does not every time quite change, nor yet quite dwell     The same,--and loves me well, and knows me as I am.     For she knows me! My heart, clear as a crystal beam     To her alone, ceases to be inscrutable     To her alone, and she alone knows to dispel     My grief, cooling my brow with her tears' gentle stream.     Is she of favor dark or fair?--I do not know.     Her name? All I remember is that it doth flow     Softly, as do the names of them we loved and lost.     Her eyes are like the statues',--mild and grave and wide;     And for her voice she has as if it were the ghost     Of other voices,--well-loved voices that have died.  A UNE FEMME     To you these lines for the consoling grace     Of your great eyes wherein a soft dream shines,     For your pure soul, all-kind!--to you these lines     From the black deeps of mine unmatched distress.     'Tis that the hideous dream that doth oppress     My soul, alas! its sad prey ne'er resigns,     But like a pack of wolves down mad inclines     Goes gathering heat upon my reddened trace!     I suffer, oh, I suffer cruelly!     So that the first man's cry at Eden lost     Was but an eclogue surely to my cry!     And that the sorrows, Dear, that may have crossed     Your life, are but as swallows light that fly     --Dear!--in a golden warm September sky.Paysages TristesCHANSON D'AUTOMNE     Leaf-strewing gales     Utter low wails          Like violins,--     Till on my soul     Their creeping dole          Stealthily wins....     Days long gone by!     In such hour, I,          Choking and pale,     Call you to mind,--     Then like the wind          Weep I and wail.     And, as by wind     Harsh and unkind,          Driven by grief,     Go I, here, there,     Recking not where,          Like the dead leaf.  LE ROSSIGNOL     Like to a swarm of birds, with jarring cries     Descend on me my swarming memories;     Light mid the yellow leaves, that shake and sigh,     Of the bowed alder--that is even I!--     Brooding its shadow in the violet     Unprofitable river of Regret.     They settle screaming--Then the evil sound,     By the moist wind's impatient hushing drowned,     Dies by degrees, till nothing more is heard     Save the lone singing of a single bird,     Save the clear voice--O singer, sweetly done!--     Warbling the praises of the Absent One....     And in the silence of a summer night     Sultry and splendid, by a late moon's light     That sad and sallow peers above the hill,     The humid hushing wind that ranges still     Rocks to a whispered sleepsong languidly     The bird lamenting and the shivering tree.  CapricesIL BACIO     Kiss! Hollyhock in Love's luxuriant close!        Brisk music played on pearly little keys,        In tempo with the witching melodies     Love in the ardent heart repeating goes.     Sonorous, graceful Kiss, hail! Kiss divine!        Unequalled boon, unutterable bliss!        Man, bent o'er thine enthralling chalice, Kiss,     Grows drunken with a rapture only thine!     Thou comfortest as music does, and wine,        And grief dies smothered in thy purple fold.        Let one greater than I, Kiss, and more bold,     Rear thee a classic, monumental line.     Humble Parisian bard, this infantile        Bouquet of rhymes I tender half in fear....        Be gracious, and in guerdon, on the dear     Red lips of One I know, alight and smile!EPILOGUE                         I     The sun, less hot, looks from a sky more clear;     The roses in their sleepy loveliness     Nod to the cradling wind. The atmosphere     Enfolds us with a sister's tenderness.     For once hath Nature left the splendid throne     Of her indifference, and through the mild     Sun-gilded air of Autumn, clement grown,     Descends to man, her proud, revolted child.     She takes, to wipe the tears upon our face,     Her azure mantle sown with many a star;     And her eternal soul, her deathless grace,     Strengthen and calm the weak heart that we are.     The waving of the boughs, the lengthened line     Of the horizon, full of dreamy hues     And scattered songs, all,--sing it, sail, or shine!--     To-day consoles, delivers!--Let us muse.                    II     So, then this book is closed. Dear Fancies mine,     That streaked my grey sky with your wings of light,     And passing fanned my burning brow, benign,--     Return, return to your blue Infinite!     Thou, ringing Rhyme, thou, Verse that smooth didst glide,     Ye, throbbing Rhythms, ye, musical Refrains,     And Memories, and Dreams, and ye beside     Fair Figures called to life with anxious pains,     We needs must part. Until the happier day     When Art, our Lord, his thralls shall re-unite,     Companions sweet, Farewell and Wellaway,     Fly home, ye may, to your blue Infinite!     And true it is, we spared not breath or force,     And our good pleasure, like foaming steed     Blind with the madness of his earliest course,     Of rest within the quiet shade hath need.     --For always have we held thee, Poesy,     To be our Goddess, mighty and august,     Our only passion,--Mother calling thee,     And holding Inspiration in mistrust.                      III     Ah, Inspiration, splendid, dominant,     Egeria with the lightsome eyes profound,     Sudden Erato, Genius quick to grant,     Old picture Angel of the gilt background,     Muse,--ay, whose voice is powerful indeed,     Since in the first come brain it makes to grow     Thick as some dusty yellow roadside weed,     A gardenful of poems none did sow,--     Dove, Holy Ghost, Delirium, Sacred Fire,     Transporting Passion,--seasonable queen!--     Gabriel and lute, Latona's son and lyre,--     Ah, Inspiration, summoned at sixteen!     What we have need of, we, the Poets True,     That not believe in Gods, and yet revere,     That have no halo, hold no golden clue,     For whom no Beatrix leaves her radiant sphere,     We, that do chisel words like chalices,     And moving verses shape with unmoved mind,     Whom wandering in groups by evening seas,     In musical converse ye scarce shall find,--     What we need is, in midnight hours dim-lit,     Sleep daunted, knowledge earned,--more knowledge still!     Is Faust's brow, of the wood-cuts, sternly knit,     Is stubborn Perseverance, and is Will!     Is Will eternal, holy, absolute,     That grasps--as doth a noble bird of prey     The steaming flanks of the foredoomed brute,--     Its project, and with it,--skyward, away!     What we need, we, is fixedness intense,     Unequalled effort, strife that shall not cease,     Is night, the bitter night of labor, whence     Arises, sun-like, slow, the Master-piece!     Let our Inspired, hearts by an eye-shot tined,     Sway with the birch-tree to all winds that blow,     Poor things! Art knows not the divided mind--     Speak, Milo's Venus, is she stone or no?     We therefore, carve we with the chisel Thought     The pure block of the Beautiful, and gain     From out the marble cold where it was not,     Some starry-chitoned statue without stain,     That one far day, Posterity, new Morn,     Enkindling with a golden-rosy flame     Our Work, new Memnon, shall to ears unborn     Make quiver in the singing air our name!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems of Paul Verlaine, by Paul Verlaine*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POEMS OF PAUL VERLAINE ******** This file should be named 8426.txt or 8426.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/4/2/8426/Produced by Michael CastelluccioUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

You may copy it, give it away orre-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License includedwith this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.orgTitle: Olla PodridaAuthor: Frederick Marryat (AKA Captain Marryat)Release Date: October 21, 2007 [EBook #23139]Language: EnglishCharacter set encoding: ASCII*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLLA PODRIDA ***Produced by Nick Hodson of London, EnglandOlla Podrida, by Captain Marryat.________________________________________________________________________Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792, and died August 8 1848.He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself towriting.  In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books, many of whichare among the very best of English literature, and some of which arestill in print.Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in hisstories.  He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work, henever knew what he was going to write.  He certainly was a literarygenius."Olla Podrida" was published in 1840, the fifteenth book to flow fromMarryat's pen.  It consists of short stories, articles, his Diary on theContinent, (as opposed to his Diary in America), short plays.  Exceptfor "The Modern Town House" there is very little of great importance inthe book.________________________________________________________________________OLLA PODRIDA, BY CAPTAIN MARRYAT.CHAPTER ONE.April 3, 1835.Reader, did you ever feel in that peculiarly distressing state of mindin which one oppressing idea displaces or colours every other,absorbing, intermingling with, empoisoning, and, like the filth of theharpy, turning every thing into disgust--when a certain incubus ridesupon the brain, as the Old Man of the Mountain did upon the shoulders ofSinbad, burdening, irritating, and rendering existence a misery--when,looking around, you see but one object perched everywhere and grinningat you--when even what you put into your mouth tastes of but that onesomething, and the fancied taste is so unpleasant as almost to preventdeglutition--when every sound which vibrates in your ear appears tostrike the same discordant note, and all and every thing will remind youof the one only thing which you would fain forget;--have you ever feltany thing like this, reader?  If you have not, then thank God, by way ofgrace, before you out with your knife and fork and begin to cut up thecontents of these pages.I have been and am now suffering under one of these varieties of"Phobias," and my disease is a Politicophobia, I will describe thesymptoms.I am now in the metropolis of England, and when I walk out every commonhouse appears to me to be the House of Commons--every lordly mansion theHouse of Lords--every man I meet, instead of being a member of society,is transferred by imagination into a member of the senate--everychimney-sweep into a bishop, and a Bavarian girl, with her "Py a proom,"into an ex-chancellor.  If I return home, the ring at the bell remindsme of a Peel--as I mount the stairs I think of the "Lobby"--I throwmyself on the sofa, and the cushion is transformed into a woolsack--if asolitary visitor calls in, I imagine a public meeting, and call outchair! chair!--and I as often address my wife as Mr Speaker, as I dowith the usual appellative of "my dear."This incubus, like the Catholic anathema, pursues me everywhere--atbreakfast, the dry toast reminds me of the toasts at public dinners--tea, of the East India charter--sugar, of the West India question--theloaf, of agricultural distress--and, as every one knows that London eggsare a lottery, according as they prove bad or good, so am I reminded ofa Whig or Tory measure.  When the newspaper is brought in, I walk roundand round it as a dog will do round the spot he is about to lie downupon.  I would fain not touch it; but at last, like a fascinated birdwho falls per force into the reptile's mouth, so do I plunge into itscolumns, read it with desperation, and when the poison has circulated,throw it away in despair.  If I am reminded to say grace at dinner, Icommence "My Lords, and gentlemen;" and when I seek my bed, as I lightmy taper, I move "that the House do now adjourn."  The tradesmen's billsare swelled by my disease into the budget, and the checks upon my bankerinto supplies.  Even my children laugh and wonder at the answers whichthey receive.  Yesterday one brought me her book of animals, andpointing to a boa constrictor, asked its name, and I told her it was an_O'Connell_.  I am told that I mentioned the names of half the membersof the Upper and Lower House, and at the time really believed that I wascalling the beasts by their right names.  Such are the effects of myunfortunate disease.Abroad I feel it even worse than at home.  Society is unhinged, andevery one is afraid to offer an opinion.  If I dine out, I find that noone will speak first--he knows not whether he accosts a friend or foe,or whether he may not be pledging his bitter enemy.  Every man looks athis neighbour's countenance to discover if he is Whig or Tory: theyappear to be examining one another like the dogs who meet in the street,and it is impossible to conjecture whether the mutual scenting will befollowed up by a growl or a wag of the tail; however, one remark willsoon discover the political sentiments of the whole party.  Should theyall agree, they are so busy in abuse that they rail at their adversarieswith their mouths full--should they disagree, they dispute so vehementlythat they forget that they were invited to dinner, and the dishes areremoved untasted, and the duties of the Amphytryon become a sinecure.Go to an evening party or a ball and it is even worse, for young ladiestalk politics, prefer discussion to flirtation, and will rather win apartner over to their political opinions than by their personal charms.If you, as a Tory, happen to stand up in a cotillion with a pretty Whig,she taps you with her fan that she may tap your politics; if you agree,it is "_En avant deux_," if not, a "_chassez croisee_."  Every thinggoes wrong--she may _set_ to you indeed, but hers is the set ofdefiance, and she shakes her _wig_ against your _Tory_.  To _turn yourpartner_ is impossible, and the only part of the figure which isexecuted _con amore_ is _dos a dos_.  The dance is over, and the lady'slooks at once tell you that you may save your "oaths," while she "takesher seat."I have tried change of scene--posted to watering places; but the deep,deep sea will not drown politics.  Even the ocean in its roaring andcommotion reminded me of a political union.I have buried myself in the country, but it has been all in vain.  Icannot look at the cattle peacefully grazing without thinking ofO'Connell's tail, Stanley's tail, and a short-docked pony reminded me ofthe boasted little tail of Colonel Peel.  The farm-yard, with its noisyoccupants, what was it but the reality so well imitated by the membersof the Lower House, who would drown argument in discord?  I thought Iwas in the lobby at the close of a long debate.  Every tenth field,every tenth furrow, (and I could not help counting,) every tenth animal,and every tenth step, reminded me of the Irish tithes; and when I saw ahawk swoop over a chicken, I thought of the Appropriation Bill--so Ileft the country.I have tried every thing--I have been every where, but in vain.  In thecountry there was no relaxation--in society no pleasure--at home norelief.  England was disjointed, never to be united until it wasdismembered--and there was no repose.  I had my choice, either to goabroad, or to go mad; and, upon mature deliberation, I decided upon theformer, as the lesser evil of the two.  So I gave--I sold--Idischarged--I paid--I packed up, and I planned.  The last was the onlyportion of my multifarious duties not satisfactorily arranged.  I lookedat the maps, plied my compasses that I might compass my wishes, measureddistances that I might decide upon my measures--planned, looked over themaps--and planned again.CHAPTER TWO.Well, as I said in my last chapter, I planned--and planned--but I mightas well conjugate it, as many others assisted--it was I planned, thouplannedst, he planned, we planned, ye planned, and they planned--andwhat annoyed me was, that I could not help considering that "the wholehouse was in a committee," and without being able "to report progress."At first it was _decided upon_ that we should proceed up the Rhine, andnot leave off paddling until we had arrived at Manheim, at which town Ifancied that I should at least be out of political distance.  We readall about Manheim, found out that it was a regular-built town, with acertain number of inhabitants--with promenades, gardens, and a fine viewof the Rhine.  "So you're going abroad--where?"  Manheim, was the reply,and all the world knew that we were bound to Manheim; and every one hadsomething to say, or something that they had heard said, about Manheim."Very nice place--Duchess Dowager Stephanie--very cheap--gay in winter--masters excellent"--were the variety of changes rung, and all wassettled; but at last one unlucky observation raised a doubt--anotherincreased--a third confirmed it.  "A very dull place--German cookery badfor children--steam-boats from Rotterdam very bad, and often obliged topass two nights on deck."  A very influential member of the committeetook alarm about the children being two nights on deck, and it was atlast decided that to go up to Manheim by steam-boat at 4 pounds, 9shillings a-head, and children at half-price was not to be thought of."I wonder you don't go to Bruges," observed a committee man; "nice quietplace--excellent masters--every thing so cheap--I once bought eightylarge peaches there for two francs."And all the children clapped their little hands, and cried out forBruges and cheap peaches.It was further submitted that it was convenient--you might go the wholeof the way by water--and Bruges was immediately under consideration."If you go to Bruges, you will find it very dull," observed another;"but you'll meet Mrs Trollope there--now Brussels is very littlefarther, and is a delightful place;" and Brussels was also referred tothe committee."You won't like Brussels--there is such a mixture, and house-rent isdear.  Now I should recommend Spa for the summer--it is a most beautifulspot--and excellent company."  And Spa was added to the list.Then after a day or two came an Anti-Teutonic, who railed againstGermany--and Germans--German towns, German travelling, and German_French_, which was detestable--German cookery, which was nothing butgrease.  "You may imagine," said he, "and so have many more, thatGermany is more pleasant and less expensive than France; but they havebeen disappointed, and so will you be.  Now, for a quiet place, I shouldrecommend Saint Omer--only thirty miles from Calais--so convenient--andvery pretty."Saint Omer--humph--very quiet and retired--and no politics--and SaintOmer was occasionally canvassed."Saint Omer!" said another who called the next day, "you'll die ofennui.  Go to Boulogne--it is delightful--you may be there as retired oras gay as you please."Boulogne to be taken into consideration many inquiries made and all verysatisfactory--good sands and excellent jackasses for the children."My dear friend, Boulogne is something like the King's Bench--at leastmost of the people only go there in preference.  Every body will supposethat you've _levanted_.  Pray don't go to Boulogne.""Why don't you go by Southampton to Havre--there you'll have quiet andamusement--beautiful country about Honfleur--scenery up the Seinesplendid; and then you can go up to Rouen by water, if you intend to goon to Paris."Havre and Honfleur submitted to the committee.But then came Dieppe, and Brest, and the environs of Paris, Versailles,Saint Germain, Passy, and other recommendations, in which every oneparticular place was proved incontestably to be more particularly suitedto us than any other, and the committee sat for three weeks, at the endof which, upon examining the matured opinions of the last seven days, Ifound them to have fluctuated as follows:--Monday morning, Manheim.  Evening, Spa.Tuesday morning, Bruges.  Evening Brussels.Wednesday morning, Saint Omer.  Evening, Boulogne.Thursday morning, Havre.  Evening Honfleur.Friday morning, Dieppe.  Evening, Passy.Saturday morning, Versailles.  Evening, Saint Germain.Sunday morning, Spa.  Evening, Brussels.The fact was, that there was a trifling difference of opinion in thecommittee--the great object appeared to be, and the great difficulty atthe same time, to find a place which would suit all parties, that is tosay, a place where there were no politics, plenty of gaiety, and cheappeaches.CHAPTER THREE.Paddle, paddle--splash, splash--bump, thump, bump.  What a leveller issea-sickness--almost as great a radical as death.  All grades, allrespect, all consideration are lost.  The master may summon John to hisassistance, but John will see his master hanged before he'll go to him;he has taken possession of his master's great coat, and he intends tokeep _it--he_ don't care for warning.The nurses no longer look after the infant or the children, they maytumble overboard--even the fond yearnings of the mother at last yield tothe overwhelming sensation, and it it were not for the mercenary orkind-hearted assistance of those who have become habituated to themotion of a vessel, there is no saying how tragical might be thecommencement of many a party of pleasure to the Continent."O lauk, Mary, do just hold this child," says the upper nurse to herassistant; "I do feel such a _sinking_ in my stomach.""Carn't indeed, nurse, I've such a _rising_."Away hurried both the women at once to the side of the vessel, leaningover and groaning heavily.  As for the children, they would soon havebeen past caring for, had it not been for my protecting arms.Decorum and modesty, next to maternal tenderness, the strongest feelingsin woman, fall before the dire prostratiou of this malady.  A young ladywill recline unwittingly in the arms of a perfect stranger, and thebride of three months, deserted by her husband, will offer no resistanceto the uncouth seaman, who, in his kindness, would loosen the laces thatconfine her heaving bosom.As for politeness, even the _ancien regime_ of the noblesse of Franceput it in their pockets as if there were a general chaos--self is theonly feeling; not but that I have seen occasional traits of good-willtowards others.  I once witnessed a young lady smelling to a bottle ofEau de Cologne, as if her existence depended upon it, who handed it overto another, whose state was even more pitiable, and I was reminded ofSir Philip Sidney and the cup of water, as he lay wounded on the fieldof battle, "Thy necessity is greater than mine."  And if I might havejudged from her trembling lips and pallid countenance, it was almost anequal act of heroism.  Paddle, paddle, splash, splash, bump, thump,bump--one would really imagine that the passengers were so many pumps,all worked at once with the vessel by the same hundred horse power, forthere were an hundred of them about me, each as sick as a horse.  "_Sicomnes_," thought I.I have long passed the ordeal, and even steam, and smoke, and washingbasins, and all the various discordant and revolting noises _from those_who suffer, have no effect upon my nervous system--still was I doomed totorment, and was very sick indeed.  For some time I had been watched bythe evil eyes of one, whom the Yankees would designate, as _almightyugly_.  He was a thin, spare man, whose accost I could well have spared,for he had the look of a demon, and, as I soon found, was possessed withthe demon of politics.  Imagine what I must have suffered when I foundout that he was a button-holder to boot.  Observing that I was the onlyone who was in a state to listen, he seized upon me as his victim.  I,who had fled from politics with as much horror as others have done fromthe cholera--I, who had encountered all the miseries of steamnavigation, and all the steam and effluvia of close cabins, to findmyself condemned with others "alike to groan--" what with King Leopold,and William of Nassau, and the Belgian share of the debt, and the Frenchand Antwerp, and his pertinacious holding of my button.  "Shall I knockhim down," thought I; "he insists upon laying his hands upon me, whyshould I not lay my hands upon him?"  But on second consideration, thatwould not have been polite; so I made other attempts to get rid of him,but in vain; I turned the subject to far countries--the rascal had beeneverywhere; at one moment he would be at Vienna, and discuss the Germanconfederation--at another in South America, canvassing the merits ofBolivar and Saint Martin.  There was no stopping him; his tongue waslike the paddle of a steam-boat, and almost threw as much spray in myface.  At last I threw off my coat, which he continued to hold in hishand by the third button, and threw myself into one of the cribsappropriated to passengers, wishing him a good night.  He put my coatdown in the crib beneath, and as he could no longer hold the button, helaid hold of the side of the crib, and continued his incessant clack.At last I turned my back to him, and made no answer, upon which he madea retreat, and when I awoke the next morning, I found that he was tooill to spout politics, although as he progressed, he spouted what wasquite as bad.Par parenthese, he was a great liar, and as he drew a long bow when hewas able to talk, so did he prove a long shot when he was sea-sick.Confound the fellow, I think I see him now--there he stood, a tall,gaunt misery, about the height of a workhouse pump, and the basin was onthe floor of the cabin, nearly three feet from his two feet; withoutcondescending to stoop, or to sit down, or to lift up the basin, so asto lessen the distance, he poured forth a parabola, "quod nuncdescribere" had just as well be omitted.  I shall therefore dismiss thispersecuting demon, by stating, that he called himself a baron, the truthof which I doubted much; that he was employed by crowned heads, which Idoubted still more.  On one point, however, I had little doubt, althoughhe did not enter upon the subject, (and his tongue to a great degreeconfirmed it) that he was a _chevalier d'industrie_."I am rid of him, thank God," exclaimed I, as I went on deck to breathea little fresh air, having lighted my cigar in the steward's berth as Iascended.  The first objects which attracted my attention, were a younggentleman and lady, the former standing by the latter, who was sittingin a pensive position, with her elbow leaning on the gunnel.  She was indeep mourning, and closely veiled."And how does the beautiful Maria find herself this morning?" said theyoung gentleman, leaning over her with his hand on the rail to supporthimself.The beautiful Maria!  How was it possible not to be attracted by such adistinguishing appellation?  The beautiful Maria!  I thought of Sterne'sMaria, and the little dog with a string, and I trimmed my ear like awindsail in the tropics to catch the soft responding, and mostassuredly, to my expectant imagination, melodious vibration of the airwhich would succeed.At last there was a reply.  "Oh! _tol, lol_!"  And that in anything buta melodious voice.  "Oh! tol, lol!"  What a bathos!  The beautifulMaria, whom in my imagination I had clothed with all the attributes ofsentiment and delicacy, whom I had conjured up as a beau ideal ofperfection, replies in a hoarse voice with, "Oh! tol, lol!"  Down shewent, like the English funds in a panic--down she went to the zero of aDoll Tearsheet, and down I went again into the cabin.  Surely this is aworld of disappointment.Perhaps I was wrong--she might have been very beautiful, with the voiceof a peacock; she might also have the plumage--but no, that isimpossible--she must, from her sex, have been a peahen.  At all events,if not very beautiful, she was very sick.  I left the beautiful Mariascreeching over the gunnel.  If the young gentleman were to repeat thesame question now, thought I, the beautiful Maria will hardly answer,"_Oh! tol, lol_!"It was very cold on deck, blowing fresh from the East.  I never heardany one give a satisfactory reason why a west wind should be warm, andan east wind cold in latitude 50 degrees N.  It is not so in the tropicswhen the east wind follows the rarefaction occasioned by the sun.  Yet,does not Byron say:--  "'Tis the land of the east, 'tis the clime of the sun."Certainly our east winds are not at all poetical."Very cold, sir," said I, addressing a round-faced gentleman in a whitegreat coat, who rested his chin and his two hands upon a thick cane."You are fortunate in not being sea-sick.""I beg your pardon, I am not fortunate.  I am worse than sea-sick, for Iwant to be sea-sick and I can't.  I do believe that everything ischanged now-a-days, since that confounded Reform Bill!"Politics again, thought I; what the devil has sea-sickness to do withthe Reform Bill?  Mercy on me, when shall I be at peace?  "Therecertainly has been some change," observed I."Change, sir! yes, everything changed.  England of 1835 is no more likemerry England of olden time, than I am like Louis the Fourteenth--ruined, sir--every class suffering, sir--badly ruled, sir.""Things are much cheaper.""Much cheaper!  Yes, sir; but what's the good of things being cheap whennobody has any money to purchase with?  They might just as well be dear.It's a melancholy discovery, sir, this steam.""Melancholy just now to those who are on board, and suffering, I grant.""Pooh, nonsense! melancholy to those on shore, sir; the engines workwhile man looks on and starves.  Country ruined, sir--people miserable--thrown out of employment, while foreigners reap the benefit; we sellthem our manufactures at a cheaper rate; we clothe them well, sir, atthe expense of our own suffering population.  But is this all, sir?_Oh, no_!"And here the gentleman dropped his chin again upon his hands, and lookedvery woeful indeed.  After a few seconds, he resumed."We are dismembered, sir--ruined by faction.  Society is disintegratedby political animosities; thousands have retreated from the scene ofviolence and excitement, to find peace and repose in a foreign land."I nodded an assent."Ay, sir, and thousands will follow, withdrawing from the country itsresources, circulating millions which enrich other nations, and avoidingtheir own share of the national burdens, which fall still heavier uponthose who remain.  But is that all, sir?  _Oh, no_!"This second "oh, no!" was pronounced in a more lugubrious note: he shookhis head, and after a pause, he recommenced.  "England is no longerpriest-ridden, sir; but she is worse, she is _law-ridden_.  Litigationand law expenses have, like locusts, devoured up the produce ofindustry.  No man is safe without a lawyer at his elbow, making over tohim a part of his annual income to secure the remainder.  And thenthere's Brougham.  But, sir, is that all?  _Oh, no_!"Another pause, and he continued.  "I never grumble--I hate grumblers; Inever talk of politics--I hate politics; but, sir, is it not the case,that madmen and fools have united to ruin the country?  Is it not true,sir, that unable to rise by their talents, and urged by a wickedambition, they have summoned main force, and the power of numbers totheir assistance, and have raised a spirit which they cannot put downagain?  Is it not true, sir, that treason walks barefaced through theland, pointing to general destruction--to a violation of all rights, toanarchy, confusion, and the shedding of blood? is not reason borne downby faction, sir? but, sir, is that all?  _Oh, no_!"This last "oh, no!" was more melancholy than the preceding, but Iconsidered that my companion must have nearly exhausted his budget ofmiseries, and was curious to ascertain what would come next."What, is there more, sir?" inquired I, innocently."More, sir.  Yes, sir, plenty more.  I ask you whether even the seasonshave not changed in our unhappy country; have we not summer withunusual, unexampled heat, and winters without cold; when shall we eversee the mercury down below sixty degrees again? never, sir.  What issummer but a season of alarm and dread?  Does not the cholera come in asregularly as green peas--terrifying us to death, whether we die of it ornot?  Of what advantage are the fruits of the earth so bountifullybestowed--have they not all been converted into poisons?  Who dares todrink a light summer wine now?  Are not all vegetables abjured, peachesthrown to the pigs, and strawberries ventured upon only by little boyswho sweep the streets, with the broom in one hand and the pottle in theother?  Are not melons rank poison, and cucumbers sudden death?  And inthe winter, sir, are we better off?  Instead of the wholesome frosts ofolden days, purifying the air and the soil, and bracing up our nerves,what have we but the influenza, which lasts us for four months, and thespasmodic cough which fills up the remainder of the year?  I am nogrumbler, sir, I hate and abhor anything like complaining, but this Iwill say, that the world has been turned upside down--that everythinghas gone wrong--that peace has come to us unattended by plenty--thatevery body is miserable; and that vaccination and steam, which have beenlauded as blessings, have proved the greatest of all possible curses,and that there is no chance of a return to our former prosperity, unlesswe can set fire to our coal mines, and re-introduce the small-pox.  But,sir, the will of Heaven be done, I shall say no more; I don't wish tomake other people unhappy; but pray don't think, sir, I've told you all._Oh, no_!"At this last "oh, no!" my companion laid his face down upon hisknuckles, and was silent.  I once more sought the deck, and preferred toencounter the east wind.  "Blow, blow, thou wintry wind, thou art not sounkind," soliloquised I, as I looked over the bows, and perceived thatwe were close to the pile entrance of the harbour of Ostend.  Tenminutes afterwards there was a cessation of paddle, paddle, thump,thump, the stern-fast was thrown on the quay, there was a rush on boardof commissionnaires, with their reiterated cries accompanied with cardsthrust into your hands, "Hotel des Bains, Monsieur."  "Hotel Waterloo,Monsieur."  "Hotel Bellevue."  "Hotel Bedford, Monsieur."  "Hoteld'Angleterre," _ad infinitum_--and then there was the pouring out of theNoah's Ark, with their countenances wearing a most paradoxicalappearance, for they evidently showed that they had had, quite enough ofwater, and, at the same time, that they required a great deal more.  Ilooked at my children, as they were hoisted up from the ladies' cabin,one after another; and upon examination I decided that, with theirsmudged faces, the Hotel des _Bains_ would be the most appropriate totheir condition; so there we went.CHAPTER FOUR.Ostend, April 18, 1835.I was confoundedly taken in by a rascal of a commissionnaire, and awarehow the feelings of travellers are affected by the weather or thetreatment they receive at any place they may pass through, I shalldisplay the heroism of saying nothing about the place, except that Ibelieve Ostend to be the most rascally hole in the world, and the soonerthe traveller is out of it so much the better will it be for his purseand for his temper.April 19.It has been assumed as an axiom that every one in this world is fond ofpower.  During our passage in the track-schuyt I had an evidence to thecontrary, for as we glided noiselessly and almost imperceptibly along, alady told me that she infinitely preferred the three-horse power of theschuyt to the hundred-horse power of the steam-packet.  We arrived atBruges, escaping all the horrors and difficulties of steam navigation.House rent at Bruges is cheap, because one half of the houses areempty--at least that was the cause assigned to me, although I will notvouch for its being the true one.  The reader may remember that this wasthe site of cheap peaches, but none met our sight, the trees not beingyet in blossom.  I ought to observe, for the satisfaction of the ForeignBible Society, that at the hotel at Bruges I saw a book of theirexportation lying on the chimney-piece in excellent preservation.April 21.As to what passed on our canal voyage to Ghent, I can only say thatevery thing passed us--for the roads were very heavy, the horses verylazy, and the boys still lazier--they rode their horses listlessly,sitting on them sideways, as I have seen lads in the country swinging ona gate--whereby the _gait_ of the track-schuyt could not be styled aswinging pace.  We did arrive at last, and thus ended our watercarriage.  At Ghent we went to the Hotel Royal, from out of the windowsof which I had a fine view of the belfry, surmounted by the BrazenDragon brought from Constantinople; and as I conjured up times past, andI thought how the belfry was built and how the dragon got there, I foundmyself at last wandering in the Apocrypha of "Bel and the Dragon."We went to see the picture by Van Eck, in the cathedral of Saint Bovin.The reader will probably wish to know who was Saint Bovin--so did I--andI asked the question of the sacristan: the reader shall have the benefitof the answer, "Saint Bovin, monsieur, il etait un _saint_."That picture of Van Eck's is worth a van full of most of the pictures wesee: it was Van Eck who invented, and was indeed the father of paintingin oil.  It is a wonderful production.Mrs Trollope says that people run through Belgium as if it were a mererailroad to other countries.  That is very true--we did the same--forwho would stop at Ostend to be swindled, or at Bruges to look at emptyhouses, or at Ghent, which is nothing but a Flanders Birmingham, whenBrussels and King Leopold, and the anticipation of something moreagreeable, were only thirty miles off.  Not one day was our departurepostponed; with post-horses and postilions we posted post haste toBrussels.CHAPTER FIVE.April 22.The Queen of Belgium "a fait un enfant."  On the Continent it is alwaysthe wife who is considered as the faiseuse; the husband is supposed, andvery often with justice to have had nothing to do in the matter--itcertainly does appear to be optional on the part of the ladies, for theylimit their family to their exact wishes or means of support.  Howdifferent is it in England, where children will be born whether it isconvenient or not!  O Miss Martineau! you may talk about the "preventivecheck," but where is it?  In England it would be as valuable as thephilosopher's stone.I think that the good people of Paris would do well, as they appear justnow to have left religion in abeyance, to take up the manners andcustoms of the empire of the Nahirs, a Mahratta nation, which I onceread about.  In that country, as in heaven, there is no marrying, norgiving in marriage.  All are free, and all inheritance is through thechildren of the sister; for although it is impossible to know who may bethe father of any of the children, they are very certain that thesister's children must have the blood on the maternal side.  What a goodarrangement this would be for the Parisians--how many _peches a mortels_would they get rid of--such as adultery, fornication, etcetera,--bypassing one simple law of the land.  By-the-by, what an admirable ideafor reforming a nation--they say that laws, now-a-days, are made toprevent crime: but if laws were enacted by which crime should no longerbe considered as crime, what a deal of trouble might be saved.The theatre is closed owing to the want of funds; the want of funds isowing to the want of honesty on the part of the manager having run awaywith the strong box, which was decidedly the very best box in thetheatre.April 26.I went to see a species of Franconi, or Astley's: there is littlevariety in these performances, as there are only a certain quantity offeats, which can be performed either by the horses or the riders,nevertheless we had some novelty.  We had the very best feminine rider Iever saw; she was a perfect female Centaur, looking part and parcel ofthe animal upon which she stood; and then we had a regularly Dutch-builtlady, who amused us with a tumble off her horse, coming down on theloose saw-dust, in a sitting posture, and making a hole in it as largeas if a covey of partridges had been husking in it for the whole day.An American black (there always is a black fellow in these companies,for, as Cooper says, they learn to ride well in America by stealingtheir masters' horses) rode furiously well and sprained his ankle--theattempt of a man in extreme pain to smile is very horrible--yet he didgrin as he bowed and limped away.  After that we had a performer, whohad little chance of spraining her ankle: it was a Miss Betsey, a femaleof good proportions, who was, however, not a little sulky that evening,and very often refused to perform her task, and as for forcing thecombined will of a female and an elephant to boot, there was no man rashenough to attempt it, so she did as little as she pleased, and itpleased her to do very little; one feat, however, was novel, she took amusket in her mouth, and fired it off with her trunk.When I was in India I was very partial to these animals; there was amost splendid elephant, which had been captured by the expedition sentto Martaban; he stood four or five feet higher than elephants usuallydo, and was a great favourite of his master, the rajah.  When thisanimal was captured there was great difficulty in getting him on boardof the transport.  A raft was made, and he was very unwillinglypersuaded to trust his huge carcass upon it; he was then towed off withabout thirty of the natives on the raft, attending him; the largestpurchases and blocks were procured to hoist him in, the mainyards doublysecured, and the fall brought to the capstern.  The elephant had beenproperly slung, the capstern was manned, and his huge bulk was lifted inthe air, but he had not risen a foot before the ropes gave way, and downhe came again on the raft with a heavy surge, a novelty which he did notappear to approve of.  A new fall was rove, and they again manned thecapstern; this time the tackle held, and up went the gentleman in theair; but he had not forgotten the previous accident, and upon whatground it is impossible to say, he ascribed his treatment to thenatives, who were assisting him on the raft.  As he slowly mounted inthe air, he looked about him very wroth, his eyes and his trunk beingthe only portions of his frame at liberty.  These he turned about inevery direction as he ascended--at last, as he passed by the mainchannels, he perceived the half of a maintop-sail yard, which had beencarried away in the slings, lying on the goose-necks; it was a weaponthat suited him admirably; he seized hold of it, and whirling it onceround with his trunk, directed the piece of wood with such good aim,that he swept about twenty of the natives off the raft, to take theirchance with a strong tide and plenty of alligators.  It was theself-possession of the animal which I admired so much, swinging in theair in so unusual a position for an elephant, he was as collected as ifhe had been roaming in his own wild forests.  He arrived and wasdisembarked at Rangoon, and it was an amusement to me, whenever I couldfind time to watch this animal, and two others much smaller in size whowere with him; but he was my particular pet.  Perhaps the reader willlike to have the diary of an elephant when not on active service.  Atwhat time animals get up who never lie down without being ordered, it isnot very easy to say.  The elephants are stalled at the foot of somelarge tree, which shelters them during the day from the extreme heat ofthe sun; they stand under this tree, to which they are chained by theirhind legs.  Early in the morning the keeper makes his appearance fromhis hovel, and throws the respective keys down to the elephants, whoimmediately unlock the padlocks of the chains, cast themselves loose,and in the politest manner return the keys to the keeper; they thenmarch off with him to the nearest forest, and on their arrival commencebreaking down the branches of the trees, selecting those which are mostagreeable to their palates, and arranging them in two enormous faggots.When they have collected as much as they think they require, they makewithies and bind up their two faggots, and then twist another to connectthe two, so as to hang them over their backs down on each side, andhaving thus made their provision, they return home; the keeper may ormay not be present during this performance.  All depends upon whetherthe elephants are well trained, and have been long in servitude.  Upontheir return, the elephants pass the chains again round their legs, lockthe padlock, and present the key as before; they then amuse themselveswith their repast, eating all the leaves and tender shoots, andrejecting the others.  Now when an elephant has had enough to eat, hegenerally selects a long bough, and pulling off all the lateralbranches, leaves a bush at the end forming a sort of whisk to keep offthe flies and mosquitoes; for although the hide of the elephant is verythick, still it is broken into crannies and cracks, into which thevermin insert themselves.  Sometimes they have the following ingeniousmethod of defending themselves against these tormentors--they put theend of their trunk down in the dust, draw up as large a quantity as theycan, and turning their trunks over their heads, pour it out over theirskin, powdering and filling up the interstices, after which they takethe long branch I have before mentioned, and amuse themselves byflapping it right and left, and in all directions about their bodies,wherever the insects may settle.And now for an instance of self-denial, which I have often witnessed onthe part of my friend the large elephant.  I have observed him verybusy, flapping right and flapping left, evidently much annoyed by thepersecution of the mosquitoes; by-the-by, no one can have an idea howhard the tiger-mosquito can bite.  I will, however, give an instance ofit, for the truth of which I cannot positively vouch; but I rememberthat once, when it rained torrents, and we were on a boating expedition,a marine who, to keep his charge dry, had his fore-finger inserted inthe barrel of his musket, pulled it out in a great hurry, exclaiming tohis comrade, "May I be shot, Bill, if one of them beggars ha'n't bit meright through the barrel of my musket."  This _par parenthese_, and nowto proceed.  As I said before, the elephant showed, by constantflagellation of his person, that he was much annoyed by his persecutors,and just at that time, the keeper brought a little naked black thing, asround as a ball, which in India I believe they call a child, laid itdown before the animal with two words in Hindostanee--"_Watch it_!" andthen walked away into the town.  The elephant immediately broke off thelarger part of the bough, so as to make a smaller and more convenientwhisk, and directed his whole attention to the child, gently fanning thelittle lump of Indian ink, and driving away every mosquito which camenear it; this he continued for upwards of two hours regardless ofhimself, until the keeper returned.  It was really a beautiful sight,and causing much reflection.  Here was a monster, whose bulk exceededthat of the infant by at least two thousand times, acknowledging thatthe image of his Maker, even in its lowest degree of perfection, wasdivine; silently proving the truth of the sacred announcement, that Godhad "given to man dominion over the beasts of the field."  And here,too, was a brute animal setting an example of devotion and self-denial,which but few Christians, none indeed but a mother, could havepractised.  Would Fowell Buxton, surrounded by a host of mosquitoes,have done as much for a fellow-creature, white or black? not he; hewould have flapped his own thighs, his own ears, his own face, and hisown every thing, and have left his neighbours to take care ofthemselves; nor would I blame him.As I am on the subject, I may as well inform my readers how and in whichway this elephant and I parted company, for it was equallycharacteristic of the animal.  The army was ordered to march, and theelephants were called into requisition to carry the tents.  Thequarter-master general, the man with four eyes, as the natives calledhim, because he wore spectacles, superintended the loading of theanimals--tent upon tent was heaped upon my friend, who said nothing,till at last he found that they were overdoing the thing, and then heroared out his complaints, which the keeper explained; but there wasstill one more tent to be carried, and, therefore, as one more or lesscould make no difference, it was ordered to be put upon his back.  Theelephant said no more, but he turned sulky.  Enough was as good as afeast with him, and he considered this treatment as no joke.  Now it sohappened that at the time the main street, and the only street of thetown, which was at least half a mile long, was crowded to suffocationwith tattoos, or little ponies, and small oxen, every one of them loadedwith a couple of cases of claret, or brandy, or something else, slung oneach side of them, attended by coolies, who, with their hooting, andpushing, and beating, and screaming, created a very bustling and livelyscene.  When the last tent was put on the elephant he was like amountain with canvass on each side of him, bulging out to a width equalto his own; there was just room for him to pass through the two rows ofhouses on each side of the street, and not ten inches to spare; he wasordered by the keeper to go on--he obeyed the order certainly, but inwhat way--he threw his trunk up in the air, screamed a loud shriek ofindignation, and set off at a trot, which was about equal in speed to ahorse's gallop, right down the street, mowing down before him everypony, bullock, and coolie that barred his passage; the confusion wasindescribable, all the little animals were with their legs in the air,claret and brandy poured in rivulets down the streets, coolies screamedas they threw themselves into the doors and windows; and at one fellswoop the angry gentle man demolished the major part of the comforts ofthe officers, who were little aware how much they were to sacrifice forthe sake of an extra tent.  With my eyes I followed my friend in hisreckless career, until he was enveloped and hid from my view in a cloudof dust, and that was my farewell of him.  I turned round, and observedclose to me the quarter-master general, looking with all his _four eyes_at the effects of his inhumanity.  But I have wandered some twentythousand miles from Brussels, and must return.CHAPTER SIX.                                                        Brussels, May 5.His Belgian Majesty, the Belgian ministers, Belgian ambassadors, Belgianauthorities, and all the Belgian nobility and gentry, all the Englishwho reside in Brussels for economy and quiet, and all the exiles andpropaganda who reside here to kick up a row, have all left Brussels bythe Porte d'Anvers.  And all the Belgians who live at Brussels have shutup their shops, and gone out by the Porte d'Anvers.  And the wholepopulace, men, women, and children, have gone out of the Porte d'Anvers.And all the infants have also gone, because the mothers could not leavethem at home.  And the generals, and their staffs, and the officers, andall the troops, and all the artillery, have also left Brussels, and goneout at the Porte d'Anvers, to keep the said populace quiet and in goodorder.  So that there is no one left at Brussels, and Brussels must forone day take care of itself.And now you of course wish to know why they have all left Brussels, andfurther, why they have gone through the Porte d'Anvers.Because there is this day the commemoration of the inauguration of the_Chemin de Fer_, which has just been completed from Brussels to Malines,and which is on this day to be opened, that is to say, that three steamtugs, whose names are the Stephenson, the Arrow, and the Elephant, areto drag to Malines and back again in the presence of his majesty, allhis majesty's ministers, all the ambassadors who choose to go, all theheads of the departments, and every body else who can produce asatisfactory yellow ticket, which will warrant their getting into one ofthe thirty-three omnibuses, diligences, or cars, which are attached tothe said three steam-tugs, the Arrow, the Stephenson, and the Elephant.I shall go and see it--I will not remain at Brussels by myself, the"last man."                                                                  May 6.It was a brilliant affair, and went off well, because the trains went onwell.  We were tugged through twelve miles of the most fertile pasturein the universe, the whole line of road so crowded with spectators, asto make evident the extreme populousness of the country.  For the firstmile it was one mass of people--and a Belgian crowd has a very agreeableeffect, from the prevailing colours being blue and white, which are veryrefreshing, and contrast pleasantly with the green background.  Everyman had his blouse, and every woman her cap and straw bonnet; but if theBelgians look well _en masse_, I cannot say that they do so in detail:the men we do not expect much from, but the women are certainly theplainest race in the whole world--I will not except the Africans.  Insome of our men-of-war it was formerly the custom to have an old knife,which was passed from one to the other, as the men joined the ship,being handed to the ugliest man they could find; he held the knife untilanother came, more unfortunate in physiognomy than himself, when it wasimmediately made over to the last, who was obliged in his turn to retainit until he could discover some one even more unprepossessing.Following up this principle with the women of Belgium, and comparingthem with other European states, they are most unequivocally entitled tohold the knife, and unless they improve by crossing the breed, I amafraid they will have it in their possession for centuries.We arrived safe at Malines, and I was infinitely amused at the varietyof astonishment in the five hundred thousand faces which we passed.  Inone rich meadow I beheld a crowd of Roman Catholic priests, who lookedat the trains in such a manner as if they thought that they were"heretical and damnable," and that the Chemin de Fer was nothing but theChemin d'Enfer.  At Malines we all got out, walked to a stone pillar,where a speech was made to the sound of martial music, and we all got inagain.  And then to show the power of his engines, Mr Stephensonattached all the cars, omnibuses, and diligences together, and directedthe Elephant to take us back without assistance from the other twoengines.  So the Elephant took us all in tow, and away we went at a veryfair pace.  It must have been a very beautiful sight to those who werelooking on the whole train in one line, covered with red cloth andgarlands of roses with white canopies over head, and decorated withabout three hundred Belgian flags, of yellow, red, and black.  However,the huge animal who dragged this weight of eighty tons became thirsty atVille Vorde, and cast us off--it took him half an hour to drink--that isto say, to take in water, and then he set off again, and we arrivedsafely at Brussels, much to the delight of those who were in the carsand also of his majesty, and all his ministers, and all his authorities,and all the mercantile classes, who consider that the millennium iscome, but very much to the disappointment of the lower classes, who haveformed the idea that the _Chemin de Fer_ will take away their bread, andwho therefore longed for a blow-up.  And Mr Stephenson having succeededin bringing back in safety his decorated cars, has been _decore_himself, and is now a Chevalier de l'Ordre Leopold.  Would not the_Iron_ order of the Belgian patriots have been more appropriate as a_Chemin de Fer_ decoration?It is impossible to contemplate any steam-engine, without feeling wonderand admiration at the ingenuity of man; but this feeling is raised to adegree of awe when you look at a locomotive engine--there is suchenormous power compressed into so small a space--I never can divestmyself of the idea that it is possessed of _vitality_--that it is aliving as well as a moving being--and that idea, joined with its immensepower, conjures up in my mind that it is some spitting, fizzing,terrific demon, who, if he could escape control, would be ready andhappy to drag us by thousands to destruction.And will this powerful invention prove to mankind a _blessing_ or a_curse_?--like the fire which Prometheus stole from heaven to vivify hisstatue, may it not be followed by the evils of Pandora's fatal casket?The lower classes of Belgium have formed an idea that the introductionof steam is to take away their bread.  Let us examine whether there isnot in this idea a degree of instinctive and prophetic truth.The axiom of our political economists is, that the grand object to besought and obtained is to produce the greatest possible results by thesmallest possible means.  The axiom, as an axiom by itself, is good; butthe axiom to be opposed to it is, that the well-being and happiness ofany state depends upon obtaining full employment for the whole industryof the people.The population of Belgium is enormous.  In England we calculate abouteighteen hundred souls to the square league.  In Belgium it amounts tothree thousand eight hundred souls to the square league.  Now it wouldbe impossible for Belgium to support this population, were it not, inthe first place, for her extensive manufactories, (for upon the cottonmanufactories alone, in which steam is as yet but partially introduced,two hundred and fifty thousand souls depend for their existence,) and inthe second place, from the subdivision of the land in small portions,arising from the laws of inheritance, which bar the right ofprimogeniture; the consequence of which is, that the major part ofBelgium is cultivated by spade husbandry, and is in the very higheststate of fertility.  Nevertheless, the proportion of those who receiverelief in Belgium from public institutions and private charities of alldescriptions amounts even at present to _one in eight persons_.  Now,allowing that the steam-engine should be generally introduced into thiscountry, the consequence must be, that machinery will supply the place,and do the work of man.  And what may be the result? that thousands willbe thrown out of employment, and must be supported by the nation.  Whenthe population is so dense that there is not room for the labour of itspresent inhabitants, it is clear that the introduction of machinery canhave but one effect--that of increasing pauperism.  Are not, then, theBelgians right in thinking that it will deprive them of their bread?That machinery has already had that effect to a certain degree inEngland cannot be denied; and not only our manufacturing, but ouragricultural population, have been distressed from an adherence to thesame principle, of obtaining the greatest possible results from thesmallest possible means.  The subdivision of land will do more torelieve the agricultural distress than anything else.  At present largefarms are preferred both by landlord and tenant, because a large farmcan be cultivated with a fewer number of men and horses; but how doesthis act?  It throws a certain quantity of labourers out of employ, whoare supported in idleness.  Is the sum gained by farmers by employingfewer men on large farms more than their proportion of the poor's ratespaid for unproductive industry?  That it may be more to the farmers ispossible, as they shift a great part of the onus upon others; but to thenation it certainly is not--for the man who does not work must still befed.  May we not then consider the following propositions as correct?That, producing the greatest possible results from the least possiblemeans, is an axiom which can only hold good when it does not interferewith the industry of the people.  That, as long as the whole populationare employed, such powers become a benefit, and a source of extrawealth.  But that, in proportion as it throws the population out ofemployment, so much the more does it prove an injury, and must finallylead to a state of things which must end in riot, anarchy, andconfusion.  _Quod est demonstrandum_--I hope it will not be in our time.CHAPTER SEVEN.                                                                Antwerp.Every one has heard of the cathedral at Antwerp and the fine pictures byRubens--every one has heard of the siege of Antwerp and General Chasse,and how the French marched an army of non-intervention down to thecitadel, and took it from the Dutch--and every one has heard how LordPalmerston protocol-ed while Marshal Gerard bombard-ed--and how it wasall bombard and bombast.  The name of Lord Palmerston reminds me thatconversing after dinner with some Belgians, the topic introduced was thegreat dearth of diplomatic talent in a country like England, wheretalent was in every other department so extremely prominent.  It was notthe first time that this subject had been canvassed in my presence byforeigners.  Naturally envious of our general superiority, it is withthem a favourite point of attack; and they are right, as it certainly isour weakest point.  They cannot disparage our army, or our navy, or ourconstitution; but they can our climate, which is not our fault, but ourmisfortune; and our diplomacy, which is our fault, and has too oftenproved our misfortune also.It certainly is the fact, that our diplomatic corps are very inferior,and this can arise but from one cause; the emoluments which have beenattached to it having rendered admission into it an advantage eagerlysought by the higher classes as a provision for the junior branches oftheir families.  Of course, this provision has been granted to those towhom government have felt most indebted for support, without the leastregard to the important point as to whether those who were admitted werequalified or not; so that the mere providing for a younger son of anadherent to the government may have proved in the end to have cost thecountry millions from the incompetence of the party when placed in asituation requiring tact and discrimination.  This evil is increased bythe system of filling up the vacant appointments according toseniority--the exploded and absurd custom of "each second being heirunto the first."  Should any man have proved, upon an emergency, that hewas possessed of the highest talent for diplomacy, it will avail himnothing--he never, under the present system, will be employed--he cannotbe admitted into the corps without having entered as a private secretaryor attache.  It would be monstrous, unheard _of_; and the very ideawould throw Lord Aberdeen on the one side, or Lord Palmerston on theother, into convulsions.  Is it therefore to be wondered at our being sodeficient in our diplomatic corps?  Surely if any point more thananother requires revision and reform, it is this; and the nation has aright to insist upon it.It may be asked, what are the most peculiar qualities necessary in adiplomatist, taking it for granted that he has talents, education, and athorough knowledge of the routine of business?  The only term which wecan give to this `desideratum is' presence of mind--not the presence ofmind required in danger, but that presence of _mind_ which enables him,when a proposition is made, at once to seize all its bearings, thedirection to which it tends, and the ultimate object (for that willalways be concealed at first) which the proposer may have in view.Diplomatists, when they enter the field, are much in the situation oftwo parties, one defending and the other attacking a stronghold.Admissions are highly dangerous, as they enable the adversary to throwup his first parallels; and too often, when you imagine that the enemyis not one jot advanced, you find that he has worked through a coveredway, and, you are summoned to surrender.  It is strange that, at thevery time that they assert that it would be impossible to employ thoseas diplomatists who have not been regularly trained to the service,officers in the army, and captains in the navy are continually soemployed, and often under circumstances of vital importance.  Now itwould be supposed that the latter of all people they must be the mostunfit; as, generally speaking, they are sent to sea, _as unfit foranything else_.  But it appears that once commanding a frigate, they aresupposed to be fit for everything.  A vessel is ordered for "particularservice," why so called I know not, except that there may be an elision,and it means "particularly _disagreeable_ service."  The captain isdirected by the Admiralty to consider himself under the orders of theForeign Office, and he receives a huge pile of documents, numbered,scheduled, and red-taped (as Bulwer says in his pamphlet), the contentsof which he is informed are to serve as a guide for his proceedings.  Hereads them over with all their verbiage and technicalities, sighs forCobbett's pure Saxon, and when he has finished, feels not a littlepuzzled.  Document Number 4 contradicting document Number 12, anddocument Number 1 opposed to Number 66; that is, as _he_ reads andunderstands English.  Determined to understand them if possible, hetakes a dose of protocol every morning, until he has nearly learnt themby heart, and then acts to the best of his knowledge and belief.  And itis undeniable that, with very few exceptions, the navy have invariablygiven satisfaction to the Foreign Office when they have been soemployed, and often under circumstances of peculiar difficulty.  I haveheard, from the best authority, that military men have also been equallysuccessful, although they have not so often been called into "particularservice."  By the bye, particular service is all done at the same priceas general service in his Majesty's navy, which is rather unfair, as weare obliged to find our own red tape, pens, ink, and stationery.As I was walking on the glacis with a friend, he pointed out to me at awindow an enormous fat man smoking his pipe, and told me that he hadbeen in the Dutch service under William of Orange; but not being a verygood hand at a forced march, he had been reduced with others tohalf-pay.  He had not been many months in retirement when he went to thepalace, and requested an audience of his Majesty, and, when admitted,stated that he had come to request that his Majesty would be pleased toput him again upon full pay.  His Majesty raised many objections, andstated his inability to comply with his request; upon which thecorpulent officer exclaimed, embracing with his arms as far as he could,his enormous paunch, "My God! your Majesty, how can you imagine that Ican fill this big belly of mine with only my half-pay?"  This_argumentum ad ventrem_ so tickled King William, that he was put on_full pay unattached_, and has continued so ever since.  The firstinstance I ever heard of a _man_ successfully pleading as ladies do atthe Old Bailey.It is hard for a wanderer from childhood like me, to find out anythingnew or interesting.  I have travelled too much and have seen too much--Iseldom now admire.  I draw comparisons, and the comparison drawn betweenthe object before my eyes, and that in my mind's eye, is unfortunatelyusually in favour of the latter.  He who hath visited so many climes,mingled with so many nations, attempted so many languages, and who hashardly anything left but the North Pole or the crater of Vesuvius tochoose between; if he still longs for something new, may well cavil atthe pleasures of memory as a mere song.  In proportion as the memory isretentive, so is decreased one of the greatest charms of existence--novelty.  To him who hath seen much, there is little left butcomparison, and are not comparisons universally odious?  Not that Icomplain, for I have a resource--I can fly to imagination--quit thisevery-day world, and in the region of fiction create new scenes andchanges, and people these with new beings.Moreover, there is still endless variety, endless amusement, and foodfor study and contemplation, in our own species.  In all countries stillthe same, yet ever varying:--  "The proper study of mankind is man."From which, I presume, we are to infer that it is time thrown away tostudy woman.At the same party in which the conversation was raised relative todiplomacy, a person with whom I was, until that day, whollyunacquainted, was sitting by me, and as it happened, the name of onewith whom I had long been on terms of intimacy was mentioned.  "Do youknow him?" said my neighbour, with a very peculiar expression.  Ireplied that I had occasionally met him, for I thought there wassomething coming forward."Well, all I can say is, that he is rather a strange person.""Indeed!" replied I; "how do you mean?""Why, they say, that he is of a very uncertain temper.""Indeed!" continued I, with the same look of inquiry, as if demandingmore information."Yes, yes, rather a dangerous man.""Do you know him?" inquired I, in return."Yes; that is to say--not very intimately--the fact is, that I haveavoided it.  I grant that he is a very clever man--but I hear that hequarrels with everybody.""Who told you so?" replied I.Oh! he was not authorised to give the name of the person."Then," replied I, "allow me to say that you have been misinformed.  Ihave been on intimate terms with that person for nearly twenty years,during which he never quarrelled with me or any one that I know of;although, I grant, he is not over civil to those whom he may despise.The only part of your communication which is correct is, that he is avery clever man, and our government are of the same opinion."My neighbour was discomfited, and said no more, and I joined the generalconversation.  What may have been his cause of dislike I know not--but Ihave frequently remarked, that if a man has made himself enemies eitherfrom neglect of that sophistry and humbug, so necessary to enable him toroll down the stream of time with his fellows without attrition, if theycan find no point in his character to assail, their last resort is, toassert that he is an uncertain tempered man, and not to be trusted.This is the last, and although not the most empoisoned, still the surestshaft in the whole quiver of calumny.  It does not exactly injure thecharacter, but it induces others to avoid the acquaintance of the partyso misrepresented.It is rather singular, and perhaps I may have been fortunate, but inmore than half-a-dozen instances I have found the very parties to whomthis character has been given, although high-minded and high-spirited,the very antithesis to the character which has been assigned them.  Thatsome do deserve the character is undoubted--but there is no species ofcalumny to be received with such peculiar caution.  It may be right tobe on your guard, but it never should be the ground for a positiveavoidance of the party accused.  Indeed, in some degree, it argues inhis favour, for it is clear that the whole charge they can bring againsthis character is an infirmity to which we are all more or lesssubjected; and he who looks for perfection in his acquaintance or hisfriends, will inevitably meet with disappointment.CHAPTER EIGHT.                                                               Brussels.I have lost all my memoranda!  I cannot find them any where.  Well--children are a great blessing when they are kept in the nursery--butthey certainly do interfere a little with a papa who has the misfortuneto be an author.  I little thought, when my youngest girl brought me upa whole string of paper dolls, hanging together by the arms, that theyhad been cut off my memoranda.  But so it was; and when I hadsatisfactorily established the fact, and insisted upon an inquisition torecover my invaluables, I found that they had had an auto-da-fe, andthat the whole string of dolls, which contained on their petticoats mywhole string of bewitching ideas, had been burnt like so many witches.But as the man said in the packet--"Is that all?"  Oh, no!--they comerushing in like a torrent, bounding, skipping, laughing, and screaming,till I fancied myself like another Orpheus, about to be torn to piecesby Bacchanals (they are all girls), and I laid down my pen, for theydrive all my ideas out of my head.  May your shadows never grow less,mes enfans, but I wish you would not make such a cursed row.The author and the author of existence do not amalgamate.  That's afact.Their joyous countenances are answered by a look of despair--theirboiling-water heat drives my thermometer down to zero--their confoundedmerriment gives me a confounded headache--their animal spirits drive meto vegetable spirits--their cup of bliss running over makes me alsorequire a bumper--brandy restores the equilibrium, and I contrive to getrid of them and my headache about one and the same time.Talking about brandy--one morning at two o'clock, about the witchingtime that ghosts do glide about in churchyards, as I was thinkingwhether it would not be better to go to bed instead of writing nonsense,in which opinion most of my readers may coincide with me, in stalkedthree young men who were considerably the worse for potation.  There isa great deal of character in inebriety--at the same time that noestimate of character can be made from its effects; for we often findthe most quiet men when sober to be the most choleric in their cups--butstill there is character, and much that is curious in witnessing itsvariety of effects.  Now these young men were each drunk in a verydifferent war--the first, in a way quite novel; for although he couldpreserve his equilibrium, and stare immensely, he had lost the power ofspeech; you saw his lips move, but no articulation or sound succeeded--the second was laughing drunk; everything that was said, either byhimself or by any one else, was magnified into a pun or a _bon mot_--thethird, with whom I had no previous acquaintance, was _politely_ drunk.I presume the idea of intruding himself upon a stranger, at such anunseasonable hour, had produced that effect--but let me describe thescene."Ha, ha, ha! we come to you--ha, ha! capital.  We want some brandy andwater; and, ha, ha! we know you always keep a stock," said the second,seating himself in an armchair.The first also took a chair, moved his lips for a few seconds, and thensat bolt upright, staring at the two candles; how many he counted Icannot pretend to say."Really," said Number Three, "we are--I'm afraid--taking a greatliberty--a very great liberty; but--an apology is certainly due--if youwill allow me to offer an apology for my two friends--will you allow meto introduce them?""Many thanks, but I have the pleasure of knowing _them_ already.""I really beg your pardon--it was quite unintentional on my part.  Itrust you are not offended?  Will you allow me to introduce myself?  Iam Captain C--, of the --.  Will you permit me to present my card, andto say how happy I shall be to make your acquaintance?"  So saying, thethird gentleman presented me with his card, and returned the card-caseinto his pocket."Capital!" cried Number Two.  "Ha, ha, ha! what an excellent joke, ha,ha, ha!  Now for the brandy-and-water."This was soon produced, and although Number One had lost allarticulation, he had still the power of deglutition; he filled hisglass, sat up more erect, stared at the candles, and drank his grog; theother did the same, when Number Three again spoke."My dear Sir, I hope you will excuse the liberty, but my name is CaptainC--, of the --.  Will you allow me the honour of presenting my card, andof saying how proud I shall be to make your acquaintance?"  So saying,he presented me another card, which I put aside with the first."Ha, ha, ha! what a good joke, to find you up.  I said we should getbrandy-and-water here; wasn't that capital?--ha, ha, ha, ha!"I could not exactly see the joke of being kept up for perhaps two morehours, but I begged they would refill their glasses, as the sittingwould be sooner ended one way or the other--either by the bottle beingempty, or their falling under the table--I did not care which--when Iwas again addressed by Number Three."I really beg your pardon, but--I'm afraid I have been very remiss--willyou allow me to introduce myself?  I am Captain C--, of the --.  Here ismy card, and I cannot say how happy I shall be if I may have the honourof your acquaintance."I bowed a third time, and received a third card."By heavens, I've finished my tumbler!  Ain't that capital?  Ha, ha, ha!famous fun;--and so has Alfred.""Famous fun, indeed," thought I, as the contents of the bottledisappeared."And Alfred is going to help himself again; well, that is capital, ha,ha, ha!--ha, ha, ha!--ha, ha, ha, ha!"Alfred, who was Number One, moved his lips, but like the frozen horn ofMunchausen, sounds would not come out; he did, however, follow up thejoke, by refilling his tumbler for the third time."Upon my honour, I've been very rude, I ought to apologise," said NumberThree, again drawing out his card-case; "but will you allow me to offermy card?  I am Captain C--, of the --, and I shall be most happy to makeyour acquaintance."I bowed again, and received the fourth card.Thus were the changes rung by numbers, one, two, and three, until I wastired out, two bottles more drank out, and I had received fifteen cardsfrom my very polite friend, whom I had never seen before.At four o'clock they all rose to depart."Upon my soul, I do believe I'm drunk," said Number Two; "capital joke--ha, ha, ha!"Number One continued dumb, brandy had not thawed him; but he stared veryhard at me, as much as to say, I would speak if I could.Number Three put into my hand the sixteenth card, and made a rashattempt at a bow.Having seen them fairly outside my door, I bolted it, saying withShakespeare--  "O! that a man  Should put an enemy in his mouth  To steal away his brains!"I have been this morning to visit an establishment founded by twobrothers, of the name of Van der Maelen.  It comprehends naturalhistory, botany, geography, and statistics, and they have, moreover, alithographic press for maps and plates.  It is a very curious, and veryspirited undertaking.  As yet, the whole has been effected by their ownmeans, which are extensive, and without any assistance from government.How few people in this world employ their money so usefully!  Thisestablishment is but yet in its infancy, and the collections are notvery valuable, although rapidly increasing, from the interest felt byevery one in its welfare.Of all collections of natural history, the fossil department is, to me,the most interesting; there is room for speculation and reflection, tillthe mind is lost in its own wanderings, which I consider one of thegreatest delights of existence.  We are indebted to the vast,comprehensive mind, and indefatigable labour of Cuvier, for the gleamsof light which have lately burst upon us, and which have rendered whatwas before mere speculative supposition now a source of interesting andanxious investigation, attended with results that are as satisfactory asthey are undeniable.That there was a period when the surface of the earth was almostentirely covered with water--a state between chaos and order, when manwas not yet created (for that then the world had not yet been renderedby the Almighty a fit receptacle for man), appears to be undoubted.  Yetthe principle of life had been thrown forth by the Almighty hand, andmonsters had been endowed with vitality, and with attributes necessaryfor their existence upon an intermediate world.These were the many varieties of the Ichthyosauri and the Plesiosauri,of whose remains we have now such abundant specimens--all animals of thelizard species; some supposed to have been supplied with wings, like theflying fish of the present day.But imagine an animal of the lizard species, one hundred and twenty feetlong--imagine such a monster--the existence of which is now provedbeyond a cavil, by the remains, deeply imbedded in the hard blue liasrocks, and which remains are now in our possession.  What a terrificmonster it must have been!  We look with horror at an alligator oftwenty or thirty feet, but imagine an animal of that species extendinghis huge bulk to one hundred and twenty feet.  Were they all destroyedwhen the waters were separated from the hand, or did they graduallybecome extinct when the earth was no longer a suitable habitation forthem, and no longer congenial to those properties with which they hadbeen endowed when ordered into existence by the Almighty power?  Thedescription of the Behemoth, by Job, has long been a puzzle to thelearned; we have no animal of the present time winch will answer to it,but in many points, this description will answer to what may be supposedwould be the appearance, the muscular power, and the habits of this hugedenizen of a former world.  "His force is in the navel of his belly.  He moveth his tail like a cedar.  His bones are as strong pieces of brass.  His bones are like bars of iron.  He lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reeds and fens.  The shady trees cover him with their shadow.  The willows of the brook compass him about."It may be a matter of deep surmise, whether all animals were created aswe now find them, that is, whether the first creation was final--or howfar the unerring hand has permitted a change to take place in the formsand properties of animals, so as to adapt them to their peculiarsituations.  I would say, whether the Almighty may not have allowed theprinciple of vitality and life to assume, at various epochs, the formand attributes most congenial to the situation, either by new formationor by change.May not the monster of former worlds have dwindled down to the alligatorof this--the leviathan to the whale?  Let us examine whether we have anyproofs in existing creation to support this supposition.  We all knowthat the hair of the goat and sheep in the torrid zones will be changedinto wool when they are taken to the colder climes, and that the reversewill also take place--we know that the hare and weazel tribes, whosesecurity is increased from their colour so nearly approaching to that ofthe earth in temperate latitudes, have the same protection afforded tothem when they are found in the regions of snow, by their changing towhite--and we know that the _rete mucosum_ of the African enables him tobear the exposure to a tropical sun, which would destroy an European.But this is not sufficient, we must examine further.  Sir Humphry Davyhas given us a very interesting account of a small animal found in thepools of water in the caves in Carniola; this animal is called the_Proteus Anguinus_ or Syren: it is a species of eel with two feet--avariety only to be found in these caves--it lives in darkness, andexposure to the light destroys it.  Now, here is an animal which we musteither suppose to have been created at the universal creation--and thatis to suppose that these caves and pools of water have also existed fromthe time of the creation--or that the principle of vitality has beenpermitted, at a later date, to take that form and those attributescongenial to its situation: it is a curious problem.  Again, it is wellknown that in the continent of New Holland there are animals who have aproperty peculiar to that continent alone--that of a pouch or falsestomach, to contain their young after their birth; it has been surmisedthat at one time the major part of that continent was under water, andthat this pouch was supplied to them for the safety of their young; noris this conjecture without strong grounds; if only the kangaroo andopossum tribes, which are animals peculiarly indigenous to thatcontinent, were supplied with this peculiar formation, the conjecturewould fall to the ground, as it might fairly be said that this propertywas only another proof of the endless variety in creation; but the mostremarkable fact is, that not only the kangaroo and opossum, animalsindigenous and peculiar to that portion of the globe, but that veryvariety of squirrel, rat, and mouse, which in every other respect are ofthe same species as those found in the other continents, are all of themprovided with this peculiar false pouch to contain their young.  Why,therefore, should all these have been supplied with it, if not for acause?  And the question now arises, whether at the first creation theyhad that pouch, or were permitted so far to change their formation, whenthe pouch became necessary for the preservation and continuation ofthese species?  That these changes are the changes of centuries, Igrant, and therefore are not likely to be observed by man, whose recordsor whose knowledge are not permitted to be handed down beyond a certainextent.  Knowledge is not happiness; and when the accumulation hasarrived to that height so as to render it dangerous, it is swept away bythe all-wise and benevolent Creator, and we are permitted to begin again_de novo_.  After all, what we term posterity is but a drop of water inthe ocean of Time.CHAPTER NINE.                                                               Brussels.There are few people in Brussels, indeed in Belgium, who do not complainof the revolution; all that goes wrong is at once ascribed to thiscause--indeed I was rather staggered by one gentleman, at Ghent, tellingme very gravely that they had had no fat oxen since the revolution; butthis he explained by stating that the oxen were fattened from the refuseof several manufactories, all of which had been broken up, theproprietors having quitted for Holland.  The revolution has certainlybeen, up to the present time, injurious to both countries, but it iseasy to foretell that eventually Belgium will flourish, and Holland, inall probability, be the sufferer.  The expenses of the latter even noware greater than her revenue, and when the railroads of Belgium havebeen completed, as proposed, to Vienna, the revenue of Holland will beproportionably decreased from her loss of the carrying trade.  It may beurged that Holland can also have her railroads--but she cannot: so largea proportion of her population find their support at present on thecanals, that a railroad would be productive of the most injuriouseffects.  It is true that she can lower her rates of carriage, but themerchant will save ten days of transport by the railroads, and thisrapidity of communication will always obtain the preference.But whatever may be the future prospects of Belgium, it is certain that,from the heavy expenses attending the support of so large an army, theretirement into Holland of most of the influential and wealthycommercial men, and the defection of almost all the nobility, at presentshe is suffering.  Brussels, her capital, has perhaps been most injured,and is no longer the gay and lively town which it was under the dynastyof King William of Nassau.  When the two countries were united, it wasthe custom of the Dutch court to divide the year between Brussels andthe Hague; and as there was not only the establishment of the King, butalso those of Princes William and Frederick (in fact three courts), aswell as all the nobility of Holland and Belgium, there was an overflowof wealth, of company, and of amusement, which rendered Brussels one ofthe most delightful winter residences on the Continent: but this has nowall passed away.  The court of Leopold, in consequence of the radicalparty having the entire sway, is but a shadow, as nearly all the Belgiannobility have retired from it.  The few who reside in town will notvisit at the palace, and live in seclusion, receiving no company, andspending no money; the majority, however, have either removed fromBrussels to their country seats, or have left the kingdom to spend theirrevenue amongst foreigners.At present there are but few English here, it being no longer the sceneof gaiety, and there are other reasons which gradually decrease thenumber.  The fact is, that Brussels is not a very cheap residence.  Theduties on every thing are now enormous, and the shop-keepers prey uponthe English as much as they can, having avowedly two prices, one forthem and the other for the Belgians.  There are very few amusements, andthe people, since the revolution, are rude and bearish, imagining thatby incivility they prove their liberty and independence.  The othertowns of Belgium are very dull and very cheap--Brussels is very dull andvery dear.  In another point, Brussels presents a contradiction to allthe other capitals of Europe, in which you generally find the mostpolished manners, and the greatest beauty in the female sex,concentrated.  At Brussels it is directly the reverse--the men areuncivil and the women plain: whereas in the Belgian provinces you willmeet with civility and respect, and at Antwerp, Ostend, and most otherprovincial towns, fall in with many fine countenances, reminding you ofthe Spanish blood which has been for centuries mingled with that of theLow Provinces.Nevertheless there are many advantages in Brussels: the communicationwith England is so rapid, and its situation so central, that it may beconsidered as the point from which travellers diverge on their variousroutes.About the end of May the arrivals and departures from Brussels areconstant; this stream continues to pour through the city for threemonths, after which, as the Belgians do not mix with the foreignresidents, the latter are left entirely to their own resources foramusement.  But the greatest objection to Brussels is, that the Englishhave brought with them the _English feeling_.  I hardly know how else toterm it, but it certainly is a feeling peculiarly English, which hastaken deep root within this last half century, and which has alreadyproduced much evil, and may eventually be productive of more seriousresults.  I refer to the system of spending more money than you canafford, to enable you to hold a certain position in the scale ofsociety.For these last forty years, during which immense fortunes have been madein England, there has been a continued struggle of wealth against rank._Parvenus_, as the aristocracy have been pleased to call them, havestarted up in every direction, vying with, and even eclipsing thenobility in lavish expenditure--in some instances, driving thearistocracy to spend more money than they could afford, and therebyimpoverishing them; in others, forcing admittance into their circles.Wealth and public opinion have latterly gained the ascendency, and thearistocracy are now more looked up to on account of their largepossessions than of their high birth.  Now this has been nothing morethan a demand for greater liberty and more extended rights on the partof the commoners of England, in proportion as they found themselves amore important body in the state.  It has not been a case of MagnaCharta, but it is still analogous; for they have demanded that thebarrier raised between them and the aristocracy should be thrown down,as soon as they possessed all the advantages, with the exception of thatnominal rank, the title too often conferred without discrimination onthe one hand or claims on the other.  As soon as a partial breach hadbeen made in this barrier,--every one rushed for admittance, displayingwealth as their ticket of admission, and the consequence has been, thatwealth has now become the passport into society; but another consequencehas also ensued, which is, that to obtain entrance, almost everybody hasbeen living and keeping up an appearance which has not been warranted bytheir means.  Many have exceeded their incomes, and then sunk down intopoverty; others have, perhaps, only lived up to their incomes; but in sodoing, have disappointed those who, induced by the appearance of so muchwealth, have married into the family and discovered that they haveobtained wives with expensive ideas, and no money.  But there have beenother reasons which have induced some to live beyond their means--theyhave done it in the pure spirit of gambling.  In England, credit, nextto money, is of most value, and according to their supposed wealth, sodid the parties obtain credit; an expenditure beyond their means was,therefore, with commercial men, nothing more than a speculation, whichvery often succeeded, and eventually procured to the parties the meansof expenditure.  It is well known that the income tax, in many cases,was paid double; commercial men preferring to give in their income attwice its real value, and pay the tax to that amount, that they might besupposed to possess more than they really had; indeed, as it wasimagined that a man would evade so heavy an impost as much as possible,he was generally considered to be worth even more than what he himselfhad stated.  It is from these causes that has arisen what I have calledthe English feeling, for display beyond the means, and which has madeour countrymen look down upon those who cannot compete with them inexpense.  Let a married couple be ever so well connected--let them havetalent, and every other advantage, it will avail them nothing, if theyhave not money, sufficient at least to keep a carriage, and not shockthe mistress of a house by the sound of the rattling steps of ahackney-coach at her door; besides which, in our commercial country, theprinciple of barter, of _quid pro quo_, is extended even to dinner andevening parties--and the reason is obvious--when people live to the fullextent, or even beyond their incomes, a little management is required.A dinner-party is so arranged, that the dinners received from others arereturned to them, and they cannot afford to ask a couple who cannot givethem a dinner in return, as they would fill up the places of others towhom a dinner is due, and who, if not asked then, must be at anothertime; and an extra dinner is an extra expense to be avoided.  TheEnglish therefore, who have only moderate incomes, have the choice,either to live beyond their means, and leave their children unprovidedfor, or of being shut out from that society, to which every other is butthe adventitious claim of wealth, they are entitled.  The consequencehas been that since the peace thousands and thousands have settled onthe Continent, that they may make more display with a small income, andthousands more, with a much better feeling, to avoid expense, and lay bya provision for their children.  Of course all these remarks are madewith reservation, but with reservation, it may be said, that in Englandwe have, or soon shall have, only two classes left, the extreme rich andthe extreme poor, for the intermediate classes are gradually retiring tothe continent, emigrating to Canada and America, or sinking down intothe second class.This is a most dangerous state of society, and, if carried to theextreme, has always proved ruinous to the state.  Although the immenseextent of the Roman empire may be asserted as the ultimate cause of itsdownfall, still that downfall was most certainly accelerated by therottenness at the core, the system of patrons and clients having thrownall the wealth into the hands of a few.  Are we not rapidly advancing tothis state in England?  The landholders are almost at the mercy of thefundholders, who, in fifty years' time, will probably have possession ofthe land as well as of the money.  And should there be no check put tothis disintegration of society, then must come what the radicals are nowso anxious to obtain, the equitable adjustment--and in that case it is aproblem how far that may not be really _equitable_; for society may, bydegrees, arrive to a state so anomalous as to warrant that the fewshould be sacrificed for the benefit of the community at large.CHAPTER TEN.                                                       Brussels, May 22.Among the _lions_ of Brussels, a dog was pointed out to me, as he lay onthe pavement in front of the House of Assembly.  It was a miserablelooking cur; but he had a tale extra attached to him, which hadmagnified him into a lion.  It was said that he belonged to a Dutchsoldier, who was killed in the revolution, at the spot where the dogthen lay, and that ever since (a period of four years) the animal hadtaken up his quarters there, and invariably lain upon that spot.Whether my informant lied, and the dog did not, I cannot pretend to say;but if the story be true, it was a most remarkable specimen of fidelityand ugliness.  And he was a sensible dog, moreover; instead of dying ofgrief and hunger, as some foolish dogs have done, he has alwaysdedicated an hour every evening to cater for his support, and thenreturns to pass the night on the spot.  I went up to him, and whenwithin two yards he thought proper to show his teeth, and snarl mostdog-matically; I may therefore, in addition to his other qualities,state that he is an ill-natured dog.  How far the report was correct, Icannot vouch; but I watched him three or four days, and always found himat his post; and after such strict investigation, had I asserted tenyears instead of four, I have a prescriptive right, as a traveller, tobe believed.It is singular that it is only in England that you can find dogs,properly so called; abroad they have nothing but curs.  I do not knowanything more puzzling than the genealogy of the animals you meet withunder the denomination of dogs in most of the capitals of Europe.  Itwould appear as if the vice of promiscuous and unrestricted intercoursehad been copied from their masters; and I have been almost tempted totake up the opinion, that you may judge of the morality of a capitalfrom the degeneracy of the dogs.  I have often, at Paris, attempted tomake out a descent; but found it impossible.  Even the late Sir GNaylor, with all the herald's office, stimulated by double fees, couldnot manage to decipher escutcheons obliterated by so many crosses.I am very partial to dogs; and one of my amusements, when travelling, isto watch their meetings with each other; they appear to me to doeverything but speak.  Indeed, a constant observer will distinguish indogs many of the passions, virtues, and rices of men; and it isgenerally the case, that those of the purest race have the noblerqualifications.  You will find in them devotion, courage, generosity,good temper, sagacity, and forbearance; but these virtues, with littlealloy, are only to be found in the pure breeds.  A cur is quite alottery: he is a most heterogeneous compound of virtue and vice; andsometimes the amalgamation is truly ludicrous.  Notwithstanding which, alittle scrutiny of his countenance and his peculiar movements will soonenable you to form a very fair estimate of his general character anddisposition.One of the most remarkable qualities in dogs is the fidelity of theirattachments; and the more so, as their attachments are very oftenwithout any warrantable cause.  For no reason that can be assigned, theywill take a partiality to people or animals, which becomes a feeling sodominant, that their existence appears to depend upon its not beinginterfered with.  I had an instance of this kind, and the _parties_ areall living.  I put up, for an hour or two, at a livery stables in town,a pair of young ponies.  On my taking them out again, the phaeton wasfollowed by a large coach-dog, about two years old, a fine grown animal,but not well marked, and in very poor condition.  He followed us intothe country; but having my establishment of dogs (taxes taken intoconsideration), I ordered him to be shut out.  He would not leave theiron gates; and when they were opened, in he bolted, and hastening tothe stables, found out the ponies, and was not to be dislodged fromunder the manger without a determined resistance.  This alternatebolting in and bolting out continued for many days; finding that I couldnot get rid of him, I sent him away forty miles in the country; but hereturned the next day, expressing the most extravagant joy at the sightof the ponies, who, strange to say, were equally pleased, allowing himto put his paws upon them, and bark in their faces.  But although theponies were partial to the dog, I was not; and aware that a voyage is agreat specific for curing improper attachments, I sent the dog down theriver in a barge, requesting the men to land him where they were bound,on the other side of the Medway; but in three days the dog again madehis appearance, the picture of famine and misery.  Even the coachman'sheart was melted, and the rights and privileges of his favouritesnow-white terrier were forgotten.  It was therefore agreed, in acabinet council held in the harness room, that we must make the best ofit; and, as the dog would not leave the ponies, the best thing we coulddo, was to put a little flesh on his bones, and make him lookrespectable.  We therefore victualled him that day, and put him on ourbooks with the purser's name of Pompey.  Now this dog proved, thatsudden as was his attachment to the ponies, it was of the strongestquality.  He never would and never has since left these animals.  Ifturned out in the fields, he remains out with them, night as well asday, taking up his station as near as possible half way between the two,and only coming home to get his dinner.  No stranger can enter theirstables with impunity; for he is very powerful, and on such occasionsvery savage.  A year or two after his domiciliation, I sold the ponies,and the parties who purchased were equally anxious at first to get ridof the dog; but their attempts, like mine, were unavailing, and, likeme, they at last became reconciled to him.  On my return from abroad, Ire-purchased them, and Pompey of course was included in the purchase.We are none of us perfect--and Pompey had one vice; but the cause of thevice almost changed it into a virtue.  He had not a correct feelingrelative to _meum_ and _tuum_, but still he did not altogether steal forhimself, but for his friends as well.  Many have witnessed the fact ofthe dog stealing a loaf, or part of one, taking it into the stables, anddividing it into three portions, one for each pony, and the other forhimself.  I recollect his once walking off with a round of beef,weighing seventeen or eighteen pounds, and taking it to the ponies inthe field--they smelt at it, but declined joining him in his repast.By-the-bye, to prove that lost things will turn up some day or another,there was a silver skewer in the beef, which was not recovered until twoyears afterwards, when it was turned up by the second ploughing.  Oneday, as the ponies were in the field where I was watching some men atwork, I heard them narrating to a stranger the wonderful feats of thisdog, for I have related but a small portion.  The dog was lying by theponies as usual, when the servants' dinner-bell rang, and off wentPompey immediately at a hard gallop to the house to get his food."Well, dang it, but he is a queer dog," observed the man, "for now he'srunning as fast as he can, to _answer the bell_."CHAPTER ELEVEN.                                                                 May 23.With all the faults of the Roman church, it certainly appears to me thatits professors extend towards those who are in the bosom of their ownchurch a greater share than most other sects, of the true spirit ofevery religion--charity.  The people of the Low Countries are the mostbigoted Catholics at present existing, and in no one country is there somuch private as well as public charity.  It is, however, to privatecharity that I refer.  In England there is certainly much to be offeredin extenuation, as charity is extorted by law to the utmost farthing.The baneful effects of the former poor laws have been to break the linkswhich bound together the upper and lower classes, produced by protectionand good will in the former, and in the latter, by respect andgratitude.  Charity by act of parliament has dissolved the socialcompact--the rich man grumbles when he pays down the forcedcontribution--while the poor man walks into the vestry with an insolentdemeanour, and claims relief, not as a favour, but as a right.  The poorlaws have in themselves the essence of revolution, for if you onceestablish the right of the poor man to any portion of the property ofthe rich, you admit a precedent so far dangerous, that the poor mayeventually decide for themselves what portion it may be that they may bepleased to take; and this becomes the more dangerous, as it must beremembered, that the effect of the poor laws is _repulsion_ between thetwo classes, from the one giving unwillingly, and the other receivingunthankfully.  How the new Poor Law Bill will work remains to be proved;but this is certain, that much individual suffering must take place,before it works out the great end which it is intended to obtain.That the Roman Catholic laity are more charitable is not a matter ofsurprise, as they are not subjected to forced contributions: but itappears to me that the Catholic clergy are much more careful and kind totheir flocks than our own.  Now, indeed, can it be otherwise, when evennow, although so much reform in the Church has been effected, so many ofour clergymen are pluralists and non-residents, expending the major partof the church revenue out of the parish, leaving to the curate, whoperforms the duty, a stipend which renders it impossible for him toexercise that part of his Christian duty to any extent?--for charity_begins_ at home, and his means will not allow him to proceed muchfarther.  That serious evils have arisen from the celibacy of the Romanclergy is true, for priests are but men, and are liable to temptation;but it is equally certain that when a Roman Catholic clergyman is a pureand pious man, he has nothing to distract his attention from thepurposes of his high calling; and not only his whole attention isdevoted to his flock, but his existence, if necessary, is voluntarilyendangered.  At the period of the cholera, there were many remarkableinstances of this devotion to death on the part of the Roman priesthood,and as many, I am forced to say, of the Protestant clergy flying fromthe epidemic, and leaving their flocks without a shepherd.  And why so?because the Protestant clergymen had wives and families depending uponthem for support, and whose means of existence would terminate withtheir own lives.  It was very natural that they should prefer thewelfare of their own families to that of their parishioners.  But inother cases not so extreme, the encumbrance of a family to a clergymanin England is very often in opposition to his duty.  To eke out a scantyremuneration, he sets up a school or takes in pupils.  Now if the dutiesof a clergyman consisted in merely reading the services on a Sunday, andchristening, burying, and marrying, he might well do so; but the realduties of a clergyman are much more important.  His duty is to watchover the lives and conduct of his parishioners, to exhort, persuade, andthreaten, if necessary; to be ever among his flock, watching them as ashepherd does his sheep.  And how can he possibly do this, if he takescharge of pupils?--he must either neglect his pupils or neglect hisparish.  He cannot do justice to both.  As Saint Paul says to thebishops, "Although it is better to marry than burn, still it is betterto be even as I am," unencumbered with wife and family, and with no tiesto distract my attention from my sacred and important calling.But the _public_ charitable institutions abroad are much betterconducted than those of England, where almost every thing of the kind ismade a job, and a source of patronage for pretending pious people, whowork their way into these establishments for their own advantage.  It isincredible the number of poor people who are effectually relieved on theContinent in the course of the year, at an expense which would not meetthe weekly disbursements of a large parish in England.  But then, howmuch more judicious is the system!  I know for a fact, that in thecounty where I reside, and in which the hard-working labourer, earninghis twelve shillings a week, is quite satisfied if he can findsufficient _bread_ for his family, (not tasting meat, perhaps, ten timesduring the whole year,) that those who were idlers, supported bycharity, were supplied with meat three or four times a week; nay, eventhe felons and prisoners in the county gaol were better fed than was theindustrious working man.  And this is what in England is called charity.It is base injustice to the meritorious.  But many of thecharitable institutions in England, from mal-administration, andpseudo-philanthropy, have become very little better than establishmentsholding out premiums for idleness and hypocrisy.Among the institutions founded by Roman Catholics and particularlydeserving of imitation, that of the Soeurs de la Charite appears to bethe most valuable.  It is an institution which, like mercy, is twiceblessed--it blesses those who give, and those who receive.  Those whogive, because many hundreds of females, who would otherwise be thrownupon the world, thus find an asylum, and become useful and valuablemembers to society.  They take no vows--they only conform to the rulesof the sisterhood during the time that they remain in it, and if theyhave an opportunity, by marriage or otherwise, of establishingthemselves, they are at free liberty to depart.  How many young women,now forced into a wretched, wicked life, would gladly incorporatethemselves into such a society in England; how many, if such a societyexisted, would be prevented from falling into error!It is well known, that to support a large community, the expenses aretrifling compared to what they are when you have the same number ofisolated individuals to provide for.  A company of two or three hundredof these sisters living together, performing among themselves thevarious household duties, washing, etcetera, and merely requiring theirfood, would not incur the same expense in house rent, firing, andprovisions, as thirty or forty isolated individuals.  Soldiers inbarracks are even well fed, housed, and clothed, at a much less expensethan it costs the solitary labourer to eat his _dry bread_ in his owncottage; and the expenses of such communities, if once established,would very soon be paid by their receipts.It would be a double charity, charity to those who would willinglyembrace the life, and charity to those who might require theirassistance.  It is well known how difficult it is to obtain a sick nursein London.  It is an avocation seldom embraced by people, until they areadvanced in years, and all feeling has been dried up by suffering ordisappointment.  Those who undertake the task are only actuated by gain,and you can expect but eye-service.  Not being very numerous, andconstantly in demand, they are overworked, and require stimulants intheir long watchings.  In fact, they drink and dose--dose and drinkagain.But how different would it be if the establishments, which I havereferred to, were formed! those who are wealthy would send for one ofthe sisters when required, and if the illness were tedious, her servicescould be replaced by another, so that over-fatigue might not destroywatchfulness and attention to the patient.  You would at once feel thatyou had those in your house in whom you could confide.  If your meansenabled you, you would send a sum to the funds of the charity in returnfor the service performed, and your liberality would enable them tosuccour those who could only repay by blessings.  A very smallsubscription would set afloat such a charity, as the funds would sorapidly come in; and if under the surveillance of the medical men whoattended the hospitals, it would soon become effective and valuable.  Itrust if this should meet the eye of any real philanthropist who hastime to give, which is more valuable than money, that he will turn itover in his mind:--the founder would be a benefactor to his country.CHAPTER TWELVE.                                                                 May 25."A man cannot die more than once," is an old apothegm, and it wouldappear bold to dispute it; but still there are lives within lives, suchas political lives, literary lives, etcetera, and there is also such athing as being dead in the eye of the law; so that it is evident that aman can die twice, that is, once professionally or legally, and oncenaturally.I presume, like all other scribblers, I must meet my literary death,that is, when I have written myself down, or have written myself out.  Ihave no objection, for I am very weary of my literary existence,although authors are not so in general; on the contrary, they canperceive in themselves no sign of decay when it is apparent to everybody around them.  Literary decay is analogous to the last stage of aconsumption, in which you believe you are not going to die, and plan forthe future as if you were in perfect health.  And yet to this complexionmust all authors come at last.  There is not a more beautiful, or moretrue portrait of human nature, than the scene between the Archbishop ofGrenada and Gil Blas, in the admirable novel of Le Sage.  Often andoften has it been brought to my recollection since I have taken up thepen, and often have I said to myself, "Is this homily as good as thelast?"  (perhaps homily is not exactly the right term my writings.)  Thegreat art in this world, not only in writing, but in everything else, isto know when to leave off.  The mind as well as the body must wear out.At first it is a virgin soil, but we cannot renew its exhausted vigourafter it has borne successive crops.  We all know this, and yet we areall archbishops of Grenada.  Even the immortal Walter Scott might havebenefited by the honesty of Gil Blas, and have burnt his latterhomilies; but had he had such an unsophisticated adviser, would he not,in all probability, have put him out by the shoulders, wishing him, likethe venerable hierarch, "a little more taste and judgment."Since I have been this time abroad, I have made a discovery for whichall prose writers ought to feel much indebted to me.  Poets can invokeApollo, the Muses, the seasons, and all sorts and varieties of gods andgoddesses, naked or clothed, besides virtues and vices, and if none ofthem suit, they may make their own graven image, and fall down beforeit; but we prose writers have hitherto had no such advantage, noprotecting deity to appeal to in our trouble, as we bite our pens, or tocall upon to deliver us from a congestion of the brain.  Now being awarethat there were upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand canonisedsaints on the Roman calendar, I resolved to run through the catalogue,to ascertain--if there was one who took prose authors under hisprotection, and to my delight, I stumbled upon our man.  By-the-bye, TomMoore must have known this, and he has behaved very ill in keeping himall to himself.  But I must introduce him.  It is the most holy, and themost blessed, Saint Brandon.  Holy Saint Brandon inspire me, and guidemy pen while I record thy legend!  In the first place, let me observethat our patron saint was an Irishman, and none the worse for that, asIreland has had as good saints as any in the calendar.  And it is nowclear that he does protect us prosaic writers, by the number ofreporters and gentlemen of the press which have been sent over from thesister kingdom.  But to proceed.Saint Brandon, it appears, was a reading man, and amused himself withvoyages and travels; but Saint Brandon was an unbeliever, and thoughtthat travellers told strange things.  He took up the Zoology of Pliny,and pursued his accounts of "Antres vast, and men whose heads do growbeneath their shoulders."  He read until his patience was exhausted,and, in a fit of anger, he threw the manuscript into the flames.  Nowthis was a heavy sin, for a man's book is the bantling of his brain,and, to say the least, it was a literary-infanticide.  That very nightan angel appeared to him, and as a penance for his foul crime (in theenormity of which every author will agree with the angel), he wasenjoined to _make the book over again_, no easy task in those days, whenmanuscripts were rare, and the art of book-making had not been invented.The sinner, in obedience to the heavenly mission, goes to work; hecharters a vessel, lays in provisions for a seven years' voyage, andwith a crew of seven monks, he makes sail, and after going round theworld seven times, during which the world went round the sun seventimes, he completed his task in seven volumes folio, which he neverpublished, but carried his manuscript away with him to prove that he hadperformed his penance.  For this miraculous voyage--and certainly withsuch a ship's company, it was a miracle--he was canonised, and is nowthe patron saint of all prose authors, particularly those whose worksare measured by the foot-rule.And now that I have made known to my fraternity that we also have asaint, all they have to do is to call upon him six or seven times, whentheir brains are at sixes and sevens.  I opine that holy Saint Brandonmade a very _hazard-ous_ voyage, for it is quite clear that, in thewhole arrangement, it was--_seven's the main_.CHAPTER THIRTEEN.                                                       En route, May 26.Passed Waterloo--was informed that two days before the Marquis ofAnglesey had arrived there, and stayed a short time to visit thecemetery of his leg; a regular family visit of course, as all the_members_ were present.                                                                 May 27.Slept at Namur.  The French are certainly superior to us in the art ofrendering things agreeable.  Now, even in the furnishing of a commonapartment, there is always something to relieve the eye, if not tointerest you.  I recollect when I was last in London, in furnishedapartments, that as I lay awake in the morning, my eye caught thepattern of the paper.  It was a shepherdess with her dog in repose,badly executed, and repeated without variation over the whole apartment.Of course I had nothing to do but to calculate how many shepherdessesand dogs there were in the room, which, by counting the numbers inlength and breadth, squaring the results, and deducting for door andwindows, was soon accomplished.  But how different was the effectproduced by the paper of the room in which I slept last night!  It wasthe history of Dunois, the celebrated bastard of France, who prays inhis youth that he may prove the bravest of the brave, and be rewardedwith the fairest of the fair.  This was not the true history, perhaps,of Dunois; but I am drawing the comparison between the associations andreminiscences conjured up by this decoration in opposition to the dulland tasteless recapitulation of the English manufacture.  From thelatter I could not extract a bare idea, except that shepherdesses are,as a race, extinct, and that Lord Althorp had taken the tax offshepherds' dogs, by way of a bonus, to relieve a distressed capital ofsome hundred millions, to which the agricultural interest had veryproperly replied, "Thank you for nothing, my Lord;" but from the sightof the French paper what a host of recollections started up at themoment!  The mind flew back to history, and was revelling in all theromance of chivalry, from King Arthur and his Knights, to the Field ofthe Cloth of Gold."Yet, after all," thought I, at the end of a long reverie, "divestchivalry, so called, of its imposing effect, examine well into itsnature and the manners of the times, and it must be acknowledged thatthe modern warfare has a much greater claim than the ancient to thetitle of chivalry.  In former times men were cased in armour of proof,and, before the discovery of gunpowder, had little to fear in a _melee_,except from those who, like themselves, were equally well armed andequally protected, and even then only from flesh wounds, which wereseldom mortal.  The lower classes, who served as common soldiers, wereat the mercy of the mounted spearsmen, and could seldom make anyimpression upon their defences.  In those days, as in the present, hewho could command most gold carried the day, for the gold procured thesteel harness, and a _plump_ of spears brought into the field was morethan equal to a thousand common men.  He who had the best temperedarmour was the most secure, and that was it be only procured by gold.He who could mount and case in iron the largest number of his followerswas the most powerful, and, generally speaking, the most lawless.Divest chivalry of its splendour, which threw a halo round it, and itwas brutal, and almost cowardly.  Single combats did certainly provecourage; but even in them, skill, and more than skill, personalstrength, or the best horse, decided the victory.  In fact, although notthe origin, it was the upholder of the feudal system, in which might wasright; and we may add, that the invention of gunpowder, which placedevery man upon a level, if not the cause of, certainly much assisted tobreak up the system.  How much more of the true spirit of chivalry isrequired in the warfare of the present day, in which every man muststand for hours to be shot at like a target, witnessing the mowing downof his comrades, and silently filling up the intervals in the ranks madeby their deaths, exposed to the same leaden messengers; a system ofwarfare in which every individual is a part of a grand _whole_, actingupon one concerted and extended plan, and forced a hundred times toexhibit the passive and more perfect bravery of constancy, for once thathe may forget his danger in the ardour of the charge!  When shall welearn to call things by their right names?"                                                          Liege, May 28.Our landlord is a most loyal man, but there is a reason for it.  Leopoldtook up his quarters at this hotel in his way to Spa.  In every room wehave upon every article of _fayence_--"Leopold, with the Genius ofBelgium crowning him with laurels, while Truth is looking on."  Everyplate, every dish, is impressed with this proof print of loyalty.  Butthis is not all, as the man said in the packet, "Oh, no!"  All thewash-hand basins, jugs, and every other article required in abed-chamber, have the same loyal pattern at the bottom.  Now it appearedto me, when I went to bed, that loyalty might be carried too far; andwhat may have been intended as respect, may be the cause of his Majestybeing treated with the greatest disrespect; and not only his sacredMajesty, but the glorious Belgian constitution also.  As for poor Truth,she is indeed said to sojourn at the bottom of a well; but in thisinstance, it would, perhaps, be as well that she should not beinsulted--I am wrong, she always is, and always will be, insulted, whenshe appears in the purlieus of a court, or in the presence of a king.After all, mine is a strange sort of Diary.  It is not a diary ofevents, but of thoughts and reminiscences, which are thrown up andcaught as they float to the surface in the whirlpool of my brain.  Nowonder!--events are but as gleanings compared to the harvest of manyyears, although so negligently gathered into store.  I have beenpuzzling myself these last two hours to find out what a man's brain islike.  It is like a kaleidoscope, thought I; it contains various ideasof peculiar colours, and as you shift them round and past, you have anew pattern every moment.  But no, it was not like a kaleidoscope, forthe patterns of a kaleidoscope are regular, and there is very littleregularity in my brain, at all events.It is like a pawnbroker's shop, thought I, full of heterogeneouspledges; and if you would take anything out, experience stands at thecounter, and makes you pay her compound interest, while many articles ofvalue are lost for ever, because memory cannot produce the duplicate.And then I compared it to almost every thing, but none of my comparisonswould hold good.  After all, thought I, I have been only playing at"What are my thoughts like?" which is a childish game; and how can Ipossibly find out what my brain is like, when my brain don't choose totell?  So I rose, and opening the window, lighted my cigar, and smokedmyself into a reverie, as I watched the smoke ascending from thechimneys of the good town of Liege.And this is the city which travellers pass through, describing it as amere manufacturing town, thought I.  A city which has, in its time,produced a greater moral influence upon society than any other inexistence--a city that has led the van in the cause of religion andliberty.  Liege presents a curious anomaly among the states of Europe.It is the only town and province, with the exception of Rome, which hasbeen, for centuries, ruled by the clerical power.  But be itrecollected, that at the very period that Christianity was offering upher martyrs at the blood-stained arena of the Coliseum, it was fromLiege (or rather Tongres, for Liege was not then built) that she wasspreading wide her tenets, unpersecuted and unrestrained, for she wastoo far removed from idolatry and imposture to be regarded.  Theprovince of Liege was the cradle of the Christian faith.  From theearliest records there were bishops at Tongres; and it was about fivehundred years after Christ, that Saint Monulphe, the reigning bishop,founded the city of Liege.  From that time until the French Revolution,this town and these fertile provinces had always remained under clericalauthority.Although these prince-bishops proved that, upon necessity, they couldchange the crosier for the coat of mail, still, as by endowments andbenefactions they increased their revenues, so did they, by the mildnessof their sway, induce thousands to settle in their territory; and toincrease their population (which was to increase their wealth), theyfirst granted to their citizens those privileges and liberties, whichhave, upon their precedent, been obtained by force or prayers by others.The very boast of the English of the present day, that _every man_'s_house is his castle_, was the sacred grant of one of the bishops to thecitizens at Liege, long before the feudal system had been abolished inour island.I may also observe, for it is to be gained from the chronicles of thisprovince, that the time at which it may be said that the primitiveChristian church first fell into error, appears to have been about onethousand years after the death of our Saviour.  And as I thought of allthis, and a great deal more, and smoked my cigar, I felt a great deal ofrespect for the good old city of Liege; and then I wandered back to thecountry I had passed through the day before, excelling in all lovelyscenery.  I had seen it before, but it was many years ago; and it may beseen many times without the least degree of satiety.  I do not know anyscenery which raises up such pleasurable sensations as that of theValley of Meuse, taking it the whole way from Namur to Liege, and fromLiege to Spa.  It is not so magnificent as the Rhine, to which it bearsa miniature resemblance.  It is not of that description creating astrong excitement, almost invariably succeeded by depression; but it isof that unchanging and ever-pleasing, joyous description, that you aredelighted without being fatigued, and have stimulus sufficient to keepyou constantly in silent admiration without demanding so much from thesenses as to weary them.  If I could have divested myself from theknowledge that I was in motion, and have fancied that the scene wasmoving past, I could have imagined myself seated at one of our largetheatres, watching one of Stanfield's splendid panoramas.  But thelighted end of my cigar at last approximated so near to my nose, that Iwas burnt out of my reverie; I took the last save--all whiffs, tried tohit an old woman's cap with the end of it, as I tossed it into thestreet, and retreated to the diurnal labour of shaving--of all humanmiseries, certainly, the "unkindest cut of all"--especially when themaids have borrowed your razor, during your absence, to pare down theapex of their corns.CHAPTER FOURTEEN.                                                                  Liege.I have been reading the "Salmonia" of Sir Humphry Davy: what a pity itis that he did not write more! there are so many curious points startedin it.  I like that description of book, which, after reading a while,you drop it on your knee, and are led into a train of thought which maylast an hour, before you look for the page where you left off.  Thereare two cases argued in this work, which led me into a meditation.  Theone is, a comparison between reason and instinct, and the other, as tothe degree of pain inflicted upon fish by taking them with the hook.Now it appeared to me, in the first question, what has been advanced isby no means conclusive, and although it is the custom to offer a pennyfor your thoughts, I shall give mine for nothing, which is perhaps asmuch as they are worth, (I say that, to prevent others from making thesarcastic remark), and in the second question, I think I can assist thecause of the lovers of the _gentle_ art of angling--why _gentle_, I knownot, unless it be that anglers bait with _gentles_, and are mostly_gentle_-men.But before I attempt to prove that angling is not a cruel sport, I mustfirst get rid of "reason and instinct."  Of reason most undoubtedly aphilanthropist would reply, "Be it so;" nevertheless, I will argue thepoint, and if I do not succeed, I have only to hedge back upon Solomon,and inquire, "If man was born to misery as the sparks fly upwards, whyare not the inferior classes of creation to have their share of it?"I do not think that any one can trace out the line of demarcationbetween reason and instinct.  Instinct in many points in wonderful,especially among insects, but where it is wonderful, it is a blindobedience, and inherited from generation to generation.  We observe, asin the case of the bees, that they obey the truest laws of mathematics,and from these laws they never have deviated from their creation, andthat all animals, as far as their self-defence or their sustenance isconcerned, show a wonderful blind obedience to an unerring power, and asagacity almost superior to reason.  But wonderful as this is, it isstill but instinct, as the progenitors of the race were equally guidedby it, and it is handed down without any improvement, or any decay inits power.  Now if it could be asserted that the instinct of animals wasonly thus inherited from race to race, and could "go no farther," theline of demarcation between reason and instinct would at once bemanifest, as instinct would be blindly following certain fixed laws,while reason would ever be assisted by memory and invention.  But wehave not this boasted advantage on the side of reason, for animals haveboth memory and invention, and, moreover, if they have not speech, theyhave equal means of communicating their ideas.  That this memory andinvention cannot be so much exercised as our own, may be true, but it isexercised to an extent equal to their wants, and they look no further;that is to say, that if any want not prepared for, or anything shouldtake place interfering with their habits and economy, instinct willenable them to meet the difficulty.  There is nothing more wonderfulthan the application of mechanical power by ants.  No engineer couldcalculate with greater nicety, and no set of men work together with suchcombination of force.  After they have made ineffectual attempts toremove a heavy body, you will observe them to meet together, consultamong themselves, and commence an entire new plan of operations.  Bees,also, are always prepared to meet any new difficulty.  If the _sphinxatropos_, or death's head moth, forces its way into the hive, the beesare well known, after having killed it with their stings, to embalm thedead body with wax--their reason for this is, that the body was toolarge for them to remove through the passage by which it entered, andthey would avoid the unpleasant smell of the carcass.  It may be argued,that instinct had always imparted to them this knowledge; but if so,they must have had a fresh accession of instinct after they had beendomiciled with men: for it is well known that the hole in the tree, inwhich the wild bees form their cells, is invariably too small to admitany animal larger than themselves, and the bodies of such sized animalsthey could remove with as much ease as they do the bodies of their owndead.I could cite a hundred instances, which would prove that animals haveinvention independent of the instinct handed down from generation togeneration.  I will, however, content myself with one instance ofsuperior invention in the elephant, which occurred at Ceylon.  Partieswere employed felling timber in the forests of Candia, and this timber,after having been squared, was dragged to the depot by a large party ofelephants, who, with their keepers, were sent there for that purpose.This work was so tedious, that a large truck was made, capable ofreceiving a very heavy load of timber, which might be transported atonce.  This truck was dragged out by the elephants, and it was to beloaded.  I should here observe, that when elephants work in a body,there is always one who, as if by common consent, takes the lead, anddirects the others, who never refuse to obey him.  The keepers of theelephants, and the natives, gave their orders, and the elephants obeyed;but the timber was so large, and the truck so high on its wheels, thatthe elephants could not put the timber in the truck according to thedirections given by the men.  After several attempts, the natives gaveup the point, and retiring to the side of the road as usual, squatteddown, and held a consultation.  In the meantime, the elephant who tookthe lead summoned the others, made them drag two of the squared piecesto the side of the truck, laid them at right angles with it, lifting oneend of each on the truck, and leaving the other on the ground, thusforming the inclined plane.  The timber was then brought by theelephants, without any interference on the part of the keepers ornatives, who remained looking on, was pushed by the elephants with theirforeheads up the inclined plane, and the truck was loaded.  Here then isan instance in which the inventive instinct of the animal--if that termmay be used--was superior to the humbler reasoning powers of the men whohad charge of them.That animals have the powers of memory as well as man, admits of nodispute.  In elephants, horses, and dogs, we have hourly instances ofit: but it descends much lower down--the piping bullfinch, who has beentaught to whistle two or three waltzes in perfect concord, must have agood memory, or he would soon forget his notes.  To detail instances ofmemory would therefore be superfluous; but, as it does occur to me whileI write, I must give an amusing instance how the memory of a goodthrashing overcame the ruling passion of a monkey, which is gluttony,the first and only instance that I ever saw it conquered.I had on board a ship which I commanded, a very large Cape baboon, whowas a pet of mine, and also a little boy, who was a son of mine.  Whenthe baboon sat down on his hams, he was about as tall as the boy waswhen he walked.  The boy having tolerable appetite, received about noona considerable slice of bread and butter, to keep him quiet tilldinner-time.  I was on one of the carronades, busy with the sun's lowerlimb, bringing it in contact with the horizon, when the boy's lowerlimbs brought him in contact with the baboon, who having, as well as theboy, a strong predilection for bread and butter, and a stronger arm totake it withal, thought proper to help himself to that to which the boyhad been already helped.  In short, he snatched the bread and butter,and made short work of it, for it was in his pouch in a moment.  Uponwhich the boy set up a yell, which attracted my notice to this violationof the articles of war, to which the baboon was equally amenable as anyother person in the ship; for it is expressly stated in the preamble ofevery separate article, "All who are _in_, or _belonging_ to."Whereupon I jumped off the carronade, and by way of assisting hisdigestion, I served out to the baboon monkey's allowance, which is, morekicks than halfpence.  The master reported that the heavens intimatedthat it was twelve o'clock; and with all the humility of a captain of aman-of-war, I ordered him to "make it so;" whereupon it was made, and sopassed that day.  I do not remember how many days it was afterwards thatI was on the carronade as usual, about the same time, and all partieswere precisely in the same situations,--the master by my side, thebaboon under the booms, and the boy walking out of the cabin with hisbread and butter.  As before, he again passed the baboon, who againsnatched the bread and butter from the boy, who again set up a squall,which again attracted my attention.  Looked round, and the baboon caughtmy eye, which told him plainly that he'd soon catch what was not "at all_my eye_;" and he proved that he actually thought so, for he actuallyput the bread and butter back into the boy's hands.  It was the onlyinstance of which I ever knew or heard of a monkey being capable ofself-denial when his stomach was concerned, and I record it accordingly.(Par parenthese:) it is well known that monkeys will take thesmall-pox, measles, and I believe the scarlet fever; but this poorfellow, when the ship's company were dying of the cholera, took thatdisease, went through all its gradations, and died apparently in greatagony.As, then, invention and memory are both common to instinct as well as toreason, where is the line of demarcation to be drawn; especially as inthe case of the elephants I have mentioned, superior instinct willinvent when inferior reason is at fault?  It would appear, if the twoqualities must be associated, that, at all events, there are twovarieties of instinct: blind instinct, which is superior to reason, sofar that it never errs, as it is God who guides; and inventive instinct,which enables the superior animals to provide for unexpecteddifficulties, or to meet those which memory has impressed upon them.But if we examine ourselves, the difficulty becomes even greater--wehave decidedly two separate qualities.  We are instinctive as well asreasonable beings; and what is inventive instinct but a species ofreason, if not reason itself?But although I say that it is hardly possible to draw the line ofdemarcation, I do not mean to say that they are one and the same thing;for instinct and reason, if we are to judge by ourselves, are in directopposition.  Self-preservation is instinctive; all the pleasures ofsense, all that people are too apt to consider as happiness in thisworld; I may say, all that we are told is wrong, all that our reasontells us we are not to indulge in, is _instinct_.Such are the advantages of being reasonable beings in _this world_;undoubtedly, we have a right to claim for ourselves, and deny to therest of the creation, the enjoyments of the next.  Byron says:--  "Man being reasonable, must get drunk."That is to say, being reasonable, and finding his reason a reason forbeing unhappy, he gets rid of his reason whenever he can.  So do themost intellectual animals.  The elephant and the monkey enjoy theirbottle as much as we do.  I should have been more inclined to agree withByron, if he had said:--  Man being reasonable, must _go to the devil_.For what are poor reasonable creatures to do, when instinct leads themto the "old gentleman;" and reason, let her tug as hard as she pleases,is not sufficiently powerful to overcome the adverse force.After all, I don't think that I have come to a very satisfactoryconclusion.  Like a puppy running round after his own tail, I am justwhere I was when I set out; but, like the puppy, I have been amused forthe time.  I only hope the reader will have been so too.And now, my brethren, I proceed to the second part of my discourse,which is, to defend anglers and fly-fishers from the charge of cruelty.It is very true that Shakespeare says, "The poor beetle that we treadon, in mortal sufferance, feels a pang as great as when a giant dies;"and it is equally true that it is as false as it is poetical.There is a scale throughout nature, and that scale has been divided byunerring justice.  Man is at the summit of this scale, being morefearfully and wonderfully made, more perfect than any other of thecreation, more perfect in his form, more perfect in his intellect; he isfiner strung in his nerves, acuter in his sympathies; he has moresusceptibility to pleasure, more susceptibility to pain.  He haspleasures denied to, and he has pains not shared with him by, the restof the creation.  He enjoys most, and he suffers most.  From man, thescale of creation descends, and in its descent, as animals are less andless perfect, so is meted out equal but smaller proportions of pleasureand pain, until we arrive to the Mollusca and Zoophyte, beings existingcertainly, but existing without pleasure and without pain--existing onlyto fill up the endless variety, and add the links to the chain of naturenecessary to render it complete.  The question which naturally will beput is, "how do you know this? it is assertion but not proof."  Butarguments are always commenced in this way.  The assertion is the_quid_, the _est demonstrandum_ always comes afterwards.  I handle mynose, flourish my handkerchief, and proceed.Man is the most perfect of creation.  What part of his body, ifseparated from the rest, can he renew?  No part, except the hair and thenail.  Reproduction can go no further.  With the higher classes ofanimals, also, there is no reproduction: but even at this slight descentupon the scale, we may already point out a great difference.  Althoughthere is no reproduction, still there are decided proofs of inferiority;for instance, a hare or rabbit caught in a trap, will struggle till theyescape, with the loss of a leg; a fox, which is carnivorous, will domore; he will _gnaw_ off his own leg to escape.  Do they die inconsequence? no, they live and do well; but could a man live under suchcircumstances? impossible.  If you don't believe me, gnaw your own legoff and try.  And yet the conformation of the Mammalia is not verydissimilar from our own; but man is the more perfect creature, andtherefore has not the same resources.I have hitherto referred only to the _limbs_ of animals; I will now gofurther.  I had a beautiful little monkey on board my ship.  By accidentit was crushed, and received such injury that the backbone was dividedat the loins, and the vertebra of the upper part protruded an inchoutside of its skin.  Such an accident in a man would have producedimmediate death; but the monkey did not die; its lower limbs were ofcourse paralysed.  The vertebra which protruded gradually rotted off,and in six weeks the animal was crawling about the decks with its forefeet.  It was, however, such a pitiable object, that I ordered it to bedrowned.  Now, if we descend lower down in the scale until we come tothe reptiles and insects, we shall find not only that the loss of limbsis not attended with death, but that the members are reproduced.  Letany one take a spider by its legs, it will leave them in your hands thatit may escape.  Confine the animal under a glass, and in a few weeks itwill have all its members perfect as before.  Lizards are still morepeculiar in their reproduction.  I was at Madeira for many months, andoften caught the lizards which played about the walls and roofs of theout-houses; and if ever I caught a lizard by the tail, he would make aspring, and leave his tail in my hand, which seemed to snap off aseasily as would a small carrot.  Now the tail of the lizard is longerthan its body, and a continuation of the vertebrae of the back.  I soonfound out that lizards did not die from this extensive loss, but, on thecontrary, that their tails grew again.  Even the first week afterwards,a little end began to show itself, and in about two months the animalhad reproduced the whole.  What I am about to say now will probably beconsidered by some as incredible; they are, however, at full liberty todisbelieve it.  One day I was looking out of the window with the lateTom Sheridan, who lived in the same house, and we observed on the roofof the out-house a lizard with two tails, but neither of them fullgrown; and we argued that, at the time the animal lost his tail, he musthave suffered some division of the stump.  Being at that time anaturalist, i.e. very cruel; I immediately caught a lizard, pulled offhis tail, notched the vertebra, and turned him loose again.  Ourconjectures were right; the animal in two or three weeks had two tailsgrowing out like the one we had seen.  I repeated this experimentseveral times, and it always appeared to succeed; and all the two-tailedlizards were called mine.Now this power of reproduction increases as you descend the scale; as aninstance, take the polypus, which is as near as possible at the bottomof it.  If you cut a polypus into twenty pieces, without any regard todivision, in a short time you will have twenty perfect polypi.Now the deductions I would draw from these remarks are--That the most perfect animals are least capable of reproduction, andmost sensible of pain.That as the scale of nature descends, animals become less perfect, andmore capable of reproduction.Ergo--they cannot possibly feel the same pain as the more perfect.Now with respect to fish, they are very inferior in the scale ofcreation, being, with the exception of the cetaceous tribe, which classwith the Mammalia, all cold-blooded animals, and much less perfect thanreptiles or many insects.  The nervous system is the real seat of allpain; and the more perfect the animal, the more complicated is thatsystem: with cold-blooded animals, the nervous organisation is next tonothing.  Most fish, if they disengage themselves from the hook, willtake the bait again; and if they do not, it is not on account of thepain, but because their instinct tells them there is danger.  Moreover,it is very true, as Sir H.  Davy observes, that fish are not killed bythe hook, but by the hooks closing their mouths and producingsuffocation.  How, indeed, would it otherwise be possible to land asalmon of thirty pounds weight, in all its strength and vigour, with apiece of gut not thicker than three or four hairs?Upon the same grounds that I argue that fish feel very littlecomparative pain, so do I that the worm, which is so low in the scale ofcreation, does not suffer as supposed.  Its writhings and twistings onthe hook are efforts to escape natural to the form of the animal, andcan be considered as little or nothing more.  At the same time Iacknowledge and, indeed, prove, by my own arguments, that it is verycruel to _bob for whale_.To suppose there are no gradations of feeling as well as of perfectionin the animal kingdom, would not only be arguing against all analogy,but against the justice and mercy of the Almighty, who does not allow asparrow to fall to the earth without his knowledge.  He gave all livingthings for our use and our sustenance; he gave us intellect to enable usto capture them: to suppose, therefore, at the same time, that heendowed them with so fine a nervous organisation as to make them undergosevere tortures previous to death, is supposing what is contrary to thatgoodness and mercy which, as shown towards us, we are ready toacknowledge and adore.I cannot finish this subject without making a remark upon creation andits perfectibility.  All _respectable_ animals, from man down to acertain point in the scale, have their lice or parasites to feed uponthem.  Some wit, to exemplify this preying upon one another, wrote thefollowing:--  "Great fleas have little fleas,  And less fleas to bite them,  These fleas have lesser fleas,  And so--_ad infinitum_."This, however, is not strictly true.  Parasites attach themselves onlyto the great.  Upon those they can fatten.  Having your blood sucked, istherefore, a great proof of high heraldry and perfectibility in thescale of creation.  If animals were endowed with speech and pride likeman, we might imagine one creature boasting to another, as a proof ofhis importance.  "And I, too, also have my louse!"CHAPTER FIFTEEN.                                                        Liege, May 30th.What strange meetings take place sometimes!  I recollect once, when Iwas sitting at a _table d'hote_, at Zurich, being accosted by a ladynext to me, and being accused of having forgotten her.  I looked withall my eyes, but could not discover that I had ever seen her before.  Atlast, after allowing me to puzzle for some time, she said: "Sir, you andI met at dinner four years ago, at Mr K--'s house in Demerara."  It wasvery true; but who would have thought of running his memory over toSouth America, to a cursed alluvial deposite, hatching monthly broods ofalligators, and surrounded by naked slaves, whilst out of the windowbefore him his eye rested upon the snow-covered mountains ofSwitzerland, and he breathed the pure air of William Tell and liberty.This morning I fell in with an acquaintance whom had not seen for years,and him also I did not recollect.  I am very unfortunate in thatrespect, and I am afraid that I have very often given offence withoutintending it; but so imperfect is my memory of faces, that I have dancedwith a lady in the evening, and the next day have not known her, becauseshe was in a bonnet and morning dress.  Sometimes the shifts I am put toare quite ludicrous, asking all manner of questions, and answering thoseput to me at random, to find out some clue as to who my very intimatefriend may be.  They ought not to be angry at my forgetting their names,for sometimes, for a few minutes, I have actually forgotten my own.  Itdoes, however, only require one clue to be given me, and then all of asudden I recollect every thing connected with the party.  I remember oneday as I was passing Whitehall, somebody came up, wrung my hand withapparent delight, and professed himself delighted to see me.  I could dono other than say the same, but who he was, and where I had seen himbefore, was a mystery.  "I am married since we parted," said he, "andhave a fine little boy."  I congratulated him with all my heart.  "Youmust come and see me, and I will introduce you to Mary.""Nothing would give me more pleasure;" but if he had only called hiswife Mrs So-and-so, I should have a _clue_.  "Let me see," said I,"where was it we parted?""Don't you recollect?" said he, "At the Cape of Good Hope."But I was still mystified, and after putting several leading questions,I found myself quite as much in the dark as ever.  At last I asked himfor his card, that I might call upon him.  He had not one in his pocket.I pulled out my tablets, and he took out the pencil, and wrote down hisaddress; but that was of no use to me."Stop, my good fellow, I have so many addresses down there, that I shallbe making some mistake; put your name down above it."He did so, and when I saw the name every thing came fast like a torrentinto my recollection; we _had been_ very intimate, and he was fullyjustified in showing so much warmth.  I could then talk to him about oldscenes, and old acquaintances; so I took his arm, and went forthwith tobe introduced to his Mary.  The knowledge of this unfortunate failingmakes me peculiarly careful not to avoid a person who appears to knowme; and one day a very absurd scene took place.  I was standing on somedoor steps close to the Admiralty, waiting for a friend, and there wasanother gentleman standing close to me, on the pavement.  A third partycame up, extending his hand, and I immediately took it, and shook itwarmly,--although who my friend was, I was, as usual, very much puzzledto find out.  Now it so happened that the hand which I had taken wasextended to the gentleman standing by me, and not to me; and the partywhose hand I was squeezing looked me in the face and laughed.  I did thesame, and he then gave his hand to the right party, and walked off.  As,however, we had said, "How d'ye do?" we had the politeness to say,"Good-by;" both taking off our hats on the broad grin.I _was_ observing, that I here met with a person whom I could notrecollect, and, as usual, I continued to talk with him, trusting to mygood fortune for the clue.  At last it was given me.  "Do you recollectthe little doctor and his wife at Bangalore?"  I did, and immediatelyrecollected him.  As the story of the doctor and his wife has often mademe laugh, and as I consider it one of the best specimens of _tit fortat_, I will narrate it to my readers.  I have since been told that itis not new--I must tell it nevertheless.A certain little army surgeon, who was stationed at Bangalore, hadselected a very pretty little girl out of an invoice of young ladies,who had been freighted-out on speculation.  She was very fond of gaietyand amusement, and, after her marriage, appeared to be much fonder ofpassing away the night at a ball than in the arms of her little doctor.Nevertheless, although she kept late hours, in every respect she wasvery correct.  The doctor, who was a quiet, sober man, and careful ofhis health, preferred going to bed early, and rising before the sun, toinhale the cool breeze of the morning.  And as the lady seldom came hometill past midnight, he was not very well pleased at being disturbed byher late hours.  At last, his patience was wearied out, and he told herplainly, that if she staid out later than twelve o'clock, he wasresolved not to give her admittance.  At this, his young wife, who, likeall pretty women, imagined that he never would presume to do any suchthing, laughed heartily, and from the next ball to which she wasinvited, did not return till half-past two in the morning.  As soon asshe arrived, the palanquin-bearers knocked for admittance; but thedoctor, true to his word, put his head out of the window, and veryungallantly told his wife she might remain all night.  The lady coaxed,entreated, expostulated, and threatened; but it was all in vain.  Atlast she screamed, and appeared to be frantic, declaring that if notimmediately admitted, she would throw herself into the well, which wasin the compound, not fifty yards from the bungalow.  The doctor beggedthat she would do so, if that gave her any pleasure, and then retiredfrom the window.  His wife ordered the bearers to take her on herpalanquin to the well; she got out, and gave her directions, and thenslipped away up to the bungalow, and stationed herself close to thedoor, against the wall.  The bearers, in obedience to her directions,commenced crying out, as if expostulating with their mistress, and thendetaching a large and heavy stone, two of them plunged it into thewater; after which, they all set up a howl of lamentation.  Now thelittle doctor, notwithstanding all his firmness and _nonchalance_, wasnot quite at ease when he heard his wife express her determination.  Heknew her to be _very entetee_, and he remained on the watch.  He heardthe heavy plunge, followed up by the shrieks of the palanquin-bearers."Good God," cried he, "is it possible?" and he darted out in his shirtto where they were all standing by the well.  As soon as he had passed,his wife hastened in-doors, locked, and made all fast, and shortlyafterwards appeared at the window from which her husband had addressedher.  The doctor discovered the _ruse_ when it was too late.  It was nowhis turn to expostulate; but how could he "hope for mercy, renderingnone?"  The lady was laconic and decided.  "At least, then, throw me myclothes," said the doctor.  "Not even your slippers, to protect you fromthe scorpions and centipedes," replied the lady, shutting the"jalousie."  At day-light, when the officers were riding their Arabians,they discovered the poor little doctor pacing the verandah up and downin the chill of the morning, with nothing but his shirt to protect him.Thus were the tables turned, but whether this _ruse_ of the well endedwell,--whether the lady reformed, or the doctor conformed,--I have neversince heard.CHAPTER SIXTEEN.                                                          Liege, June 2.The academy or college established at Liege in 1817 is very creditableto the Liegeois.  Much has been done in fifteen years: the philosophicalapparatus, collections of minerals and natural history, are allexcellent for instruction, although the minerals are not very valuable.The fossils found in the Ardennes are very interesting, and ought to bea mine of wealth to the Liegeois, as by exchanging them they might soonhave a valuable collection.  It is a pity that the various museums ofEurope do not print catalogues, not of their own collections only, butalso of the duplicates which they can part with, so that they may becirculated, not only among the national collections, but also amongprivate cabinets; by so doing they would all become more perfect.  It iscurrently reported that more duplicates have been allowed to perish inthe cellars of the British Museum than would have furnished all thecabinets in Europe.  It may be replied, that other cabinets had nothingto offer in exchange; but that is only a surmise: and even if they hadnot, they should have been presented to other institutions abroad.Science ought not to be confined to country or people: it should beconsidered as universal.To the college is annexed a botanical garden.  There is nothing Idislike more than a botanical garden.  I acknowledge the advantages,perhaps the necessity, of such institutions; but they always appear tome as if there was disarrangement instead of arrangement.  What may becalled order and classification seems to me to be disorder andconfusion.  It may be very well to class plants and trees for study, butcertainly their families, although joined by man, were never intended tobe united by God.  Such a mixture in one partition, of trees, andshrubs, and creeping plants, all of which you are gravely told are ofone family.  I never will believe it: it is unnatural.  I can see orderand arrangement when I look at the majestic forest-trees throwing abouttheir wild branches, and defying the winds of heaven, while they affordshelter to the shrubs beneath, which in their turn protect and shelterthe violets that perfume all around.  This is beautiful and natural--itis harmony; but in a botanical garden every thing is out of its place.The Scripture says, "Those whom God hath joined let no man put asunder;"may we not add, Those whom God hath sundered let no man presume to join.I felt as I looked at the botanical garden as if it were presumptuousand almost wicked, and as it was on the banks of the Meuse, I sat downon the wall and recovered myself by looking at the flowing river, andthinking about utility and futility, "and all that sort of thing andeverything else in the world," as poor Matthews used to say,--and thereI sat for an hour, until my thoughts revolved on the propriety of goingback and eating my dinner,--as Mrs Trollope used to do when she was inBelgium.As I was walking about in the evening, I perceived a dirty little alleyilluminated with chandeliers and wax candles.  There must be a ball,thought I, or some gaiety going on: let us inquire.  "No, sir," replieda man to whom I put the question, "it's not a ball,--it is a Monsieurwho has presented to an image of the Virgin Mary which is up that court,a petticoat, which, they say, is worth one thousand five hundred francs,and this lighting-up is in honour of her putting it on."  The race offools is not extinct, thought I.  I wonder whether, like King Ferdinand,he worked it himself.  Belgium is certainly at this present thestronghold of superstition.CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.                                                                 June 3.Went to Harquet's manufactory of arms, and was much amused.  They exportall over the world, and the varieties they make up for the differentmarkets are astonishing.  They were then very busy completing an orderfor several thousand muskets for the Belgian troops, which load at thebreech and fire off without locks or priming.  They showed me afowling-piece on the same principle, which they fired off under water.But the low prices of the arms astonished me.  There were a largequantity of very long fowling-pieces with the _maker's_ name at_Constantinople_, for the Turkish gentlemen, at thirty francs each: acommon musket was fourteen francs.  I perceived in a corner a largenumber of muskets, of infamous workmanship, and with locks resemblingthose awkward attempts made two hundred years back.  I asked what theywere for.  They were for the South American market, and made to order,for the people there would use no others: any improvement was eschewedby them.  I presume they had borrowed one of the Spanish muskets broughtover by Pizarro as a model, but, at all events, they were very cheap,only eight francs each.  God help us, how cheaply men can be killednow-a-days!It is very seldom that you now meet with a name beginning with an X, butone caught my eye as I was walking through the streets here.  _UrbanXhenemont, negociant_.  I perceive there are still some to be found inGreece; the only one I know of in England is that of Sir Morris Ximenes,who, I presume, claims descent from the celebrated cardinal.  Themention of that name reminds me of the songs of the improvisatore,Theodore Hook, and his address in finding a rhyme for such an awkwardname as Ximenes.  Few possess the talent of improvising.  In Italy it ismore common, because the Italian language admits the rhyme with so muchfacility; but a good improvisatore is rare even in that country.  Therewas a Dutchman who was a very good improvisatore, a poor fellow who wentabout to amuse companies with his singing and this peculiar talent.  Oneday a gentleman dropped a gold Guillaume into a glass of Burgundy, andtold him if he would make a good impromptu, he should have both the wineand the gold: without hesitation he took up the glass, and suiting theaction to the word, sang as follows:--  "Twee Goden in een Glas,  Wat zal ik van maken?  K' steek Plutus in myn tas,  K slaak Bacchus in myn Kaken."Which may be rendered into French as follows:--  "Quoi! deux dieux dans un verre,  Eh bien! que vais-j'en faire?  J'empocherai Plutus,  J'avalerai Bacchus."The gentleman, who gave me this translation, also furnished me with acopy of extempore French verses, given by a gentleman of Maestricht, whowas celebrated as an improvisatore.  They certainly are very superior.He was at a large party, and agreed to improvise upon any theme givenhim by five of those present in the way of _Souvenir_.  The first personrequested the souvenir of _early youth_.  "Vous souvient-il?  Amis de ma jeunesse,  Des beaux momens de nos fougueux exploits?  Quand la raison sous le joug de l'ivresse,  Essaye en vain de soutenir ses droits.  Ce tems n'est plus, cet age de folie,  Ou tout en nous est presse de jouir:  Mes bons amis, du printemps de la vie  Gardons toujours le joyeux _souvenir_."The next party requested a souvenir of the conscription, many of them,as well as the poet, having been forced into the army of France.  "Vous souvient-il? que plus tard, sous les armes  Plusieurs donons, designes par le sort,  Loin des parents; versant d'ameres larmes,  Allaient trouver ou la gloire ou la mort.  Ces jours de deuil par milliers dans l'histoire  Ne viendront plus, sur nous s'appesantir  Amis, volons an temple de Memoire  Effacons-en le sanglant _souvenir_."The third party requested a souvenir of his "first love."  "Vous sonvient-il? de cet enfant de Guide  Fripon ruse, volage et seducteur;  Qui par les yeux d'une beaute timide,  D'un trait de feu veut nous frapper au coeur.  Du sentimens que sa fleche fit naitre,  Et que la mort peut seul aneantir,  Eternissons le ravissant bien-etre,  En conservant un si beau _souvenir_."The fourth proposed as a theme, the morning of his marriage.  "Vous souvient-il? du jour ou l'hymenee  Vint nous dicter ses eternelles loix,  En attachant a notre destinee  L'objet sacre de notre premier choix.  Solennite qui par des voeux nous lie,  De saints devoirs chargeant notre avenir,  Solennite que le vulgaire oublie  Nous te gardons en pieux _souvenir_."The last party desired him to wind up with _friendship_.  "Quel souvenir puis-je chanter encore,  Apres celui ne dans la volupte?  Il en est un que le tems corrobore,  C'est le premier elan de l'amitie.  Eh! qui de nous n'a pas dans sa jeunesse,  Livre son coeur a ses charmes puissants,  Sainte Amitie, jusqu'a dans la vieillesse,  Console-nous des ravages du tems."I should imagine that after the gentleman had finished all this, he musthave been pretty well out of breath.About four miles from Liege is the celebrated manufactory of Seraing,belonging to Messrs. Cockerell.  It is beautifully situated on the banksof the Meuse, and was formerly the summer palace of the PrinceArchbishop.  But it is not only here that you observe these symptoms ofthe times--all over France you will perceive the same, and the majorportion of the manufactories have the arms of princes or noblesemblazoned over the facade, while the interiors, which once were theabode of refinement and luxury, are now tenanted by artisans andappropriated to utility.  The utilitarian system was, however, morefully exemplified before the Belgian revolution, for William of Nassauwas, in fact, a partner of Mr Cockerell.  Mr Cockerell, the father,who is now dead, came over from England before the peace, bringing withhim either the machinery for spinning cotton, or the knowledge necessaryfor its construction, so jealously guarded by our manufacturers.  Heestablished himself at Liege, and soon gained patrons.  The firm has nowthree or four manufactories at Liege besides the one at Seraing.  Largeas was the bishop's palace, it has been increased to about three timesits original size: it reminds me more of Portsmouth yard than any otherplace.  The number of workmen employed in this manufactory alone isbetween fourteen and fifteen hundred.  They make every variety of steamengines, and not only supply this country, but Prussia, Austria, France,and even Russia.  People talk of Mr Cockerell having done much mischiefto his country by furnishing foreigners with the machinery which enabledus to undersell them.  I doubt it very much: I consider that the soonerother countries are enabled to compete with us to a certain extent, thebetter it will be for England.  At present we are in an unhealthy state,and chiefly arising from the unlimited use of machinery.  Let us losethat advantage, and, if not richer, at all events we shall be muchhappier.  We are now suffering under a plethora of capital at the sametime that we are oppressed with debt.  As for Mr Cockerell, it may bevery well to cry out about patriotism, but the question is, would notevery other man have done the same?  Had he not a right to bring histalents to the best market? and before he is accused of having had noregard for his country, it may first be fairly asked, what regard hadhis country shown for him?CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.                                                           Spa, June 10.Here we are, and for a time at rest.  Rest! no, the wheels of thecarriage may rest, even the body for a time may rest, but the mind willnot.  We carry our restlessness with us wherever we go.  Like asteam-engine, the mind works, and works, and works, sometimes, indeed,with less rapidity of motion; but still it goes on, goes on in itsever-continued labour; waking or sleeping, no repose; until the body,which is the mechanical part of the engine, is worn out by constantfriction, or the steam of the mind is exhausted.  And people tell you,and believe that there is rest in the grave.  How can that be?  The soulis immortal and cannot exist without consciousness.  If not conscious,it does not exist; and if conscious, it must work on, even beyond thegrave, and for ever.  To assert that there is rest in the grave, isdenying the immortality of the soul.  And what a contemptible, baseslave the body is to the soul!  I was going to say that he could notcall his soul his own; but that would be a Catachresis, and I hate andabominate every thing which begins with _cat_.  It is singular that theyare all unpleasant, or unlucky, or unsafe; for instance--+=============+=========================================+Y             Yremind you of                            Y+-------------+-----------------------------------------+YCat-acombs   Ydeath, funerals, and mummies.

The bell of the church infront of my window is tolling;--it ceases; and the pealing of the organ,with the chanting of the priests, comes distinct and clear upon my ear,as the notes of the bugle over the still water, from some dashingfrigate in the Sound, beating off at sunset.  How solemn and howbeautiful is this early prayer!  The sun is rising, the mists of thenight are rolling off, and the voices and music resound at the same timeto heaven.  The church is full, and many remain outside, uncovered, andkneeling in humility.  But who comes here, thought I, as a man in ashabby coat walked to within a few yards of the church door, and laiddown his burden, consisting of a drum, a fiddle, a roll of canvass, achair, and a long pole.  This is a curious stock in trade, methinks; howin the name of all the saints do you gain your livelihood?  This wassoon ascertained.  A minute before the mass was over, he fixed his poleupright in the ground, hung his canvass on it, and unrolled it,displaying a picture divided in six compartments.  He then hung hisfiddle to his button, took his drum, and putting his chair close to hispole, stood upon it, giving a long, but not loud roll of his drum, whichhe repeated at intervals, to attract attention.  He had taken hisstation with judgment; and as the people came out of church, he had soona crowd about him, when he commenced with crossing himself, and thencontinued to explain the legend which was attached to his pictures onthe canvass.  I could not hear all, but still I could understand enoughto fill up the rest.  It was the wonderful cure performed by a certainsaint; and as he told the story, he pointed to the differentcompartments with his fiddlestick, for he had laid aside his drum assoon as he had collected an audience.  Now and then he crossed himselfdevoutly, and at last informed the crowd around him that he had the veryprayer, and the very remedy which had been prescribed.  He then playedhis fiddle, singing the prayer in a solemn chaunt; and then he pulledout of his pocket a packet of little books and little boxes.  They areonly one halfpenny each; and all that is necessary is, that they shouldtouch the figure of the saint on the canvass, to be imbued with thenecessary virtue.  He sells them rapidly; each time that he puts them tothe canvass crossing himself, and insisting that the party who purchasesshall do the same.  He takes his fiddle again, and sings the history ofthe saint, pointing with his fiddlestick to the compartments of thepicture as he goes on; and now he pulls out more little books and moreboxes; and how fast they purchase them!  The stock in trade in his ownpossession is certainly of little value; but he possesses a fruitfulmine in the superstition of others.  Ah, well!  Are not those inside thechurch setting him the example of mixing up religion with quackery?Spa is beautifully situated, between abrupt hills covered with verdure;the walks cut in these hills are very beautiful, and much pains havebeen taken to render the place agreeable;--no wonder, when we recollecthow many crowned heads have visited the place: but the sun of Spa hasset, probably never to rise again; for whatever may be the property ofits waters, to be frequented, a watering-place must be fashionable.There are many causes for its desertion.  One is, the effects of theBelgian revolution.  During the time that Belgium was attached to theNetherlands, the king, with the prince and princess of Orange, came herealmost every year, bringing with them, of course, a great number of thenobility; but now the nobility have deserted the court; and when Leopoldcame here, no one followed.  He was disgusted, and remained but a fewdays.  The Prussians used also to resort very much to Spa; but the kingof Prussia finding that so many young men were ruined at thegaming-tables, and so much distress occasioned by it, with a mostfatherly despotism, has refused all the officers permission to visitSpa, and has forbidden the medical men to recommend the waters.  TheRussians also flocked in great numbers to Spa; but the emperor, althoughvery indifferent about their losing their money, is very particularabout his subjects gaining revolutionary opinions; and Spa being in arevolutionary country, has been condemned: they may just as well ask togo to Siberia, for that would probably be their route; and lastly, thereis one more cause which, these two last seasons, has had a powerfuleffect, neither more nor less than a certain book, called the "_Bubblesof the Brunnen_."  I say for the last two seasons, for its influencewill not extend to a third, as hundreds and hundreds who have gone tothe Baths with the intention of passing this season, have alreadyreturned in disgust.  A word upon this.When Sir George Head published his "Bubbles," he set people almost asmad as they were during the great "Bubble Mania;" and like all themining and other associations, they have proved but bubbles at last.  Itis said that one hundred and thirty-five thousand passports were takenout last year to go up the Rhine, by people who wished to see the pigsgo through their daily manoeuvres, to an unearthly solo on the horn, andto witness the decapitation of the Seltzer-water bottles, which werecondemned as traitors.  Now, so large an influx of people to theseGerman watering-places could have but one effect; that of a gloriousharvest to the innkeepers, and those who had lodgings to let.  Theprices, at these places, have now become so enormous, that three florinshave been asked for a single bed, and everything else has risen in thesame proportion.  The reaction has now begun to take place, and everyday and every hour we have carriages returning through Liege, and othertowns, from these watering-places, the occupants holding up their hands,quite forgetting the pigs and bottles, and only exclaiming againstextortion, and everything German.  They have paid too dear for theirwhistle, as Franklin used to say; the bubble has burst, and they lookwith regret at their empty purses.  And yet, all that Head said in hisamusing book was true.  He rambled through a verdant and unfrequentedlane, and described what he felt as he stopped to pick blackberries.  Animmense multitude have followed him, the green lane has been beaten downinto a high road, and, as for blackberries, they are only to be procuredat the price of peaches in May.And now let us reflect whether the bubble will not also burst with theGermans.  Formerly they were contented with moderate profits, andreceived their visitors with humility and thankfulness.  Now, that theyhave suddenly made large profits, they have become independent andunceremonious; and, like most people, because they have reaped a goldenharvest for two years, they anticipate that it will continue.  The valueof property at these places has risen, speculations have been enteredinto on a large scale, provisions and the necessaries of life havebecome dear; new houses are building against time, and the proprietorssmoke their pipes with becoming gravity, calculating upon their futuregains.  But the company will fall off more and more each succeedingyear, although the speculations will continue; for people always find agood reason for a bad season, and anticipate a better one the next.  Atlast, they will find that they are again deserted, and property willsink in value to nothing; the reaction will have fully taken place,prices will fall even lower than they were at first; honesty andcivility will be reassumed, although, probably, the principal will havebeen lost.  Thus will the bubble burst with them, as it has already withdeserted Spa.But when all idle people shall have visited all the bubbling fountainsof Germany, where are they to go next?  There are some very nice springsin Iceland not yet patronised; but although the springs there are hot,the Springs, vernally speaking, are cold.  I can inform travellers wherethey will find out something new, and I advise them to proceed to theboiling springs at Saint Michael's, one of the Western isles, and whichare better worth seeing than all the springs that Germany can produce.I will act as _guide de voyage_.When you land at Saint Michael's, you will find yourself in one of thedirtiest towns in the world, and will put up at one of the worst hotels;however, you will have to pay just as dear as if lodged at theClarendon, and fed at the _Rocher de Cancale_.  The town contains manyinhabitants, but more pigs.  German pigs are not to be compared to them.You must then hire donkeys and ascend to the mountains, and after a hotride, you will arrive at a small valley in the centre of the mountains,which was once the crater of a volcano, but is now used by nature as akettle, in which she keeps hot water perpetually boiling for those whomay require it.  There you will behold the waters bubbling and boilingin all directions, throwing up huge white columns of smoke, brought outin strong relief by the darker sides of the mountains which rear theirheads around you.  The ground you tread upon trembles as you walk; youfeel that it is only a thin crust, and that in a moment you may sinkinto the vast cauldron below, and have a hot bath without paying for it.Continue along the valley, and you will find lakes of still,deadly-cold water, with hot springs at their verge, throwing the smokeover their surface, while they pour in their boiling water as if theywould fain raise the temperature; depositing sulphur in cakes andcrystals in their course.  And in another spot there is a dark,unfathomable hole, called the Devil's Mouth: you approach it, and youhear low moanings and rumblings, as if nature had the stomach-ache; andthen you will have a sudden explosion, and a noise like thunder, and ashower of mud will be thrown out to a distance of several yards.  Waitagain; you will again hear the moans and rumblings, and in about threeminutes the explosion and the discharge will again take place; and thushas this eternal diarrhoea continued ever since the memory or traditionof man.Yet, upon this apparently insecure and dangerous spot have been erectedhouses and baths, and it is resorted to by the fashionables of SaintMichael's, who wish, by its properties, to get rid of certain cutaneousdisorders: for the whole air is loaded with sulphurous vapour, as theeternal pot keeps boiling.Observe the advantages of this place:--you may have a bath as hot as youplease, as cold as you please, or you may have a mud _douche_, if youhave that buffalo propensity; and then you will have to rough it, whichis so delightful; you will find little or nothing to eat, and plenty ofbedfellows in all their varieties, a burning sun, and a denseatmosphere, and you will be very delighted to get back again, which,after all, is the _summum bonum_ to be obtained by travel.Not very far from this valley of hot water there is another valley,containing four small lakes, and in those lakes are found the mostbeautiful gold and silver fish, perhaps, in the world.  How they camethere, Heaven only knows; but I mention this because there is a curiouscoincidence.  These lakes are known by the name of the Quadre Cidade, orfour cities.  Now, if my readers will recollect, in the "ArabianNights," there is a story of a valley with four lakes, which were oncefour cities, and that in these lakes were fish of various beautifulcolours, who were once the inhabitants.  If I recollect right, when thefish were caught and put into the frying-pan, they jumped up and made aspeech; (so would fish now-a-days, if they were not mute;) and the storyis told by a prince, whose lower extremities are turned into blackmarble, very convenient, certainly, if he dined out every day, as he hadonly his upper toilet to complete.  This coincidence appeared to me tobe very curious, and had I had time and opportunity I certainly shouldhave fried four of these unfortunate fish, to ascertain whether theywere of the real breed spoken of in the Arabian Tales, of theauthenticity of which no one, I presume, will venture to doubt.CHAPTER NINETEEN.                                                           Spa, July 15.What a curious history might be afforded by Spa and its gaming tables!When Spa was in its glory, when crowned heads met and dukes were forcedto remain in their carriages for want of accommodation, when it was thefocus of all that was _recherche_ and brilliant, for Spa was so beforethe French revolution, the gaming tables were a source of immenseprofit; and to whom do you imagine that a great portion of the profitsbelonged?--to no less a person than the most sacred and puissant prince,the Bishop of Liege, who derived a great revenue from them.  But itwould appear as if there was a judgment upon this anomalous secularproperty, for these gaming-tables were the cause of the Prince Bishoplosing all, and being driven out of his territories.  There were twogaming establishments at Spa, the Redoubt in the town, and the Vauxhallabout a quarter of a mile outside of it.  The Redoubt is a finebuilding, with splendid ball-rooms and a theatre, but you must go_through the gaming-rooms_ to enter either the ball-room or the theatre.The Vauxhall has no theatre, but the rooms are even more spacious; butwhen Spa was at its zenith, even these two immense edifices were barelysufficient for the company.  Both these establishments were under thesame proprietors, and it so happened that the English nobility, who werealways a very strong party here, were displeased with the conduct of thelessees, and immediately raised funds for the building of a secondVauxhall.  The bishop ordered the building to be discontinued, but, asby the privileges granted by former bishops, this was a violation of therights of the Liegeois, his order was disregarded, and the Vauxhall nowknown by the name of _the Vauxhall_, was finished.  When finished, thebishop would not permit it to be opened, but his commands beingdisregarded, he came down with two hundred soldiers and two pieces ofcannon and took possession.  This created a revolution, and the bishopwas ultimately obliged to fly his territory and seek assistance.  ThePrussians marched an army into the city, and there was apparentsubmission, but as soon as they quitted, the insurrection again tookplace, and the bishop was forced again to solicit aid from theAustrians, for Prussia would no longer interfere.  Metternich, who wasso fond of legitimacy that he considered the gaming-tables a legitimatesource of revenue to the apostle, marched in an Austrian army, andhundreds were slaughtered that the bishop might obtain his rights.  Suchwas the state of affairs when the French revolution broke out andconvulsed Europe, and the province of Liege was among the very first toreceive with open arms the _bonnet rouge_ and to join themselves withFrance, and thus did the bishop lose his beautiful province for ever.As far as Liege was concerned, the French revolution proved a blessing.It certainly was a disgraceful finale to an ecclesiastical power, which,as I have before mentioned, had formerly led the van in the march ofChristianity and liberty.But it appears that the clergy are fated to have an interest in thesegaming-tables, the stipend of the English resident clergyman being, evennow, paid out of their profits; for when Belgium was made over to theNetherlands, King William assumed his right to the bishop's former shareof the profits of the tables, and of course brought as many people downhere as he could to _lose their money_, as he pocketed his _thirds_.Since the revolution, Leopold is in King William's shoes, but there arelittle or no profits, as Spa is deserted and the expenses of theestablishments are great.  Perhaps there is no spot of ground inEurope--I will not except Paris--where so much money has been lost bygaming as at Spa.  I was walking with a friend who pointed out to me asmall pavilion in a garden.  "There," says he, "the Prince of Orange,who played very deeply, lost to a Spanish gentleman those very jewelsthat were pretended to be stolen.  It was well got up in the papers, butthat is the real truth."  How far it may be the truth or not, I cannotpretend to say, and only know that in Spa you cannot pick your teethwithout all the world knowing it, and that this is fully believed at Spato be the real truth of the disappearance of the splendid jewels of theprincess, which have since been redeemed from the Spanish gentleman, whonow resides at the Hague.Gaming has always been held up in abhorrence as a vice; but it is rathera passion strongly implanted by nature, and abhorrent from the dreadfuleffects produced by its overpowering influence, than a vice _per se_.Life itself is a lottery, and the best part of our life is passed ingambling.  It is difficult to draw the line between gambling andspeculation, for every speculation is a gambling transaction.  Is notthe merchant a gambler? in fact, is not every venture an act ofgambling?  As for the Stock Exchange, it is the very worst species ofgambling.  All we can say is, that gambling may be legitimate orotherwise; that is, there are species of gambling which may enrich theindividual if he is fortunate, but whether it enriches him or not, atall events it is beneficial to the community at large.  A merchantspeculates--he sends out manufactures of every description: he fails,and is ruined: but the artisans have procured employment for theirindustry, and, although the merchant fails, the community at large hasbenefited.  This is legitimate gambling; but do people in business stopthere?  No: they will agree to deliver so many thousands of casks oftallow or tons of hemp at such and such a time and at a certain price,whatever the price may then be.  They cannot complete their engagement,and they are ruined; but in this instance, which is simply termedspeculation, we have quite as much gambling as if the money were at oncelaid down on the table, and the chances decided in an hour instead of somany months.  But there is this difference, that this party does notinjure his character by such a transaction, whereas, if he lost hismoney at the gaming-table he would.  The English are, with the exceptionof the Americans, the most gambling nation under heaven; naturally so,because they are the greatest mercantile nation.  The spirit of gamblingis innate, and when directed into the proper channel it becomesenterprise.  It is doubtless a great moral error on the part of agovernment to encourage vice with the view of increasing the revenue,but, at the same time, there is no tax so well laid on as that which isimposed on vice.  Again, there are certain propensities in man whichcannot be overcome, and which, if attempted to be wholly eradicated bylegal enactments, would occasion more evil still.  All that a judiciousgovernment can or should attempt to effect is, to restrain them withinproper bounds, to regulate them, and as much as possible to keep themout of sight, that the virus may not extend.  It is well known, thatcertain houses are licensed by the magistrates, because, it beingimpossible to eradicate the vice, they can do no more than to separateit, that it may not be communicated to the healthier part of thecommunity.  Now upon this principle, which is the true principle ofsound legislation, I have often thought that it was a great error in ourlegislature when they consented to put down the public lotteries inEngland.  I am convinced that they were beneficial, acting assafety-valves to the gambling spirit of the nation, and that theirprohibition has been productive of much crime and misery.  The spirit ofgambling cannot be eradicated; it ought, therefore, to be kept withindue bounds.  There was one great advantage in the English lottery; itwas drawn but once a year, and those who purchased the tickets werecontent to remain quiet until their success was made known.  Thechances, although very distant, of so high a prize, satisfied the spiritof gambling; if they lost, they purchased again, and waited patientlyfor another year, trusting to be more fortunate.  Now, although theygambled, they did not acquire the _habit_ of gaming.  What has been theconsequence since the lotteries have been abolished? that there arehells of every description established throughout the metropolis, fromthose which admit the stake of a shilling, to Crockford's splendidPandemonium; and those who were formerly content with a lottery ticket,now pass their evenings away from their families, and ruin themselves ina very short time.  The lottery never ruined any one.  The sum stakedmight be large for the circumstances of the parties, but it was a yearlystake, and did not interfere with the industry, the profits, or thedomestic happiness of the year.  One half the tradesmen who now appearin the "Gazette," have been ruined by frequenting the low hells withwhich the metropolis abounds.  From the above considerations, I do notthink it was advisable to abolish the lotteries.The next question is one upon which I hesitate to offer an opinion; butit is worthy of consideration how far it may be advisable to license andtax gaming-houses.  Were it possible to put them down altogether, thequestion need not be discussed; but it is impossible.  Has anymagistrate ventured to interfere with Crockford's, where it is wellknown that the highest gaming is carried on every night?  Are you notpermitted to walk through the club at any hour of the day?  Do they nothave the tables exposed to the view of every one?  Yet who hasinterfered, although you find that the smaller hells are constantlybroken in upon, and the parties had up to the police-office?  Are notthe laws made for all?  Is that an offence in the eyes of government ina poor man which is not one in the rich?  Yet this is the case: and whyso?  Because the rich will game, and the government cannot prevent them.Has not a man a right to do as he pleases with his own money?  Youlegalise the worst of gambling on the Stock Exchange, for a man canthere risk what he cannot pay: you cannot control the gaming of therace-course, and yet you would prevent a man from gambling after his ownfashion.  You wink at the higher classes ruining themselves, and youwill not permit the middle classes.  Now the consequence of not havinglicensed tables is, that you have no control over them, and the public,who will play, are the dupes of rascals who cheat in every way: whereas,if a certain number were licensed and controlled, those who play wouldhave a better chance, and the licensed tables taxed by government wouldtake care to put down all others who were not.  We must legislate forsociety as it is, not as it ought to be; and, as on other points, wehave found it necessary to submit to the lesser evil of the two, it is aquestion whether in this also we might not do better by keeping withindue bounds that which it is impossible to prevent.I was amused with an anecdote told me to-day.  An Englishman and aFrenchman arrived at Spa in the same diligence.  They both took up theirquarters at the same hotel, but from that moment appeared to have nofurther intimacy."Do you see that fellow?" would the Englishman say, pointing at theFrenchman, "I know him, and he's a confounded rogue.  I recommend you tobe shy of him.""Voyez-vous cet Anglais?" said the Frenchman as the Englishman passedby.  "Gardez-vous en bien; c'est un coquin superieur."Thus did they continue to warn the company of each other, until theclose of the season, when one fine day they both went off together inthe diligence, leaving all their debts unpaid, and their trunks andportmanteaus for the benefit of the landlord of the hotel, who, onopening them, found them to contain nothing but stones and rubbish.This was a new species of holy alliance, but the _ruse_ was by no meansill advised.  When you hear a man constantly proclaiming the roguery ofanother, you are too apt to give him credit for honesty in his ownperson.  Thus, with those whom each party associated and dealt with,they obtained a credit for honesty, which enabled them to succeed intheir roguish endeavours.CHAPTER TWENTY.                                                                 Ostend.From Spa to Liege, from Liege to Brussels, from Brussels to Ostend, howdetestable it is to go over the same ground again and again! only to beimposed upon and cheated again and again.  What a weary world this is,and what a rascally one!  How delightful a little honesty would be, byway of a change!  Of all the rascality spread like butter on bread overthe surface of the globe, certainly the butter lies thicker on theconfines of each territory.  There is a concentration of dishonesty atthe ports of embarkation and debarkation.  Take London when you landfrom a steam-boat, or Dover, or Calais, or Ostend.  It is nothing but asystem of extortion or over-reaching.  And why so? because in the hurry,the confusion, the sickness, and the ignorance of what is right,everything that is wrong can be practised with impunity.  These preyersupon mankind at the confines, remind you of the sharks in India, whoalways ply _in the surf_, where their motions cannot be seen, and theunwary are invariably their prey.  I have knocked three down already,and one would imagine they would hasten for redress; but they will not,for that would take hours, and during these hours they will lose theopportunity of making their harvest, so they get up again, and pocketthe affront, that they may not lose time in filling their pockets.Talking about roguery, there was a curious incident occurred some timeback, in which a rascal was completely outwitted.  A bachelor gentleman,who was a very superior draftsman and caricaturist, was laid up in hisapartments with the gout in both feet.  He could not move, but sat in aneasy chair, and was wheeled by his servant in and out of his chamber tohis sitting-room.  Now a certain well-known vagabond ascertained thefact, and watched until the servant was sent upon a message.  Theservant came out of the front door, but left the area door open,communicating with the kitchen.  Down went the vagabond, entered thekitchen, and walked up stairs, where, as he anticipated, he found thegentleman quite alone and helpless."I am sorry, sir, to see you in this situation," said the rogue; "youcannot move, and your servant is out."The gentleman stared."It is excessively careless of you to leave yourself so exposed, forbehold the consequences.  I take the liberty of removing this watch andthese seals off the table, and putting them into my own pocket; and, asI perceive your keys are here, I shall now open these drawers, and seewhat suits my purpose.""Oh! pray help yourself, I beg," replied the gentleman, who was awarethat he could do nothing to prevent him.The rogue did so accordingly; he found the plate in the sideboarddrawer, and many other articles which suited him, and in about tenminutes, having made up his bundle, he made the gentleman a very lowbow, and decamped.  But the gentleman had the use of his hands, and hadnot been idle; he had taken an exact likeness of the thief with hispencil, and on his servant returning soon after, he despatched himimmediately to Bow Street with the drawing, and an account of what hadhappened.  The likeness was so good, that the man was immediatelyidentified by the runners, and was captured before he had time todispose of a single article purloined.  He was brought to the gentlemanin two hours afterwards, identified, the property found on him sworn to,and, in six weeks, he was on his passage to Botany Bay.CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.                                                       London, November.We have the signs of the times here.  I peep through the fog and seequite enough to satisfy me that the prosperity is but partial.  Money inplenty, but lying in heaps--not circulated.  Every one hugs his bag, andis waiting to see what the event may be.  Retrenchment is written up asevident as the prophetic words of fire upon the walls of Belshazzar'spalace--_To let--to let--to let_.  Leave London in any direction, andyou find the same mystical characters every one hundred yards of theroad.  This beautiful villa, this cottage ornee, this capital house withpleasure-grounds, this mansion and park--all--all to let.  It is saidthat there are upwards of seven thousand of these country seats to letwithin twelve miles of the metropolis.  Again, look at the arms of thecarriages which still roll through the streets, and you will perceivethat if not with a coronet or supporters, nine out of ten have thewidow's _lozenge_.  And why so? because they belong to the widows ofthose who died in the times of plenty, and who left them large jointuresupon their estates.  They, of course, can still support and even bettersupport, the expense; but the estates now yield but sufficient to paythe jointure, and the incumbent swallows up the whole.  And where arethe real owners of the properties?  At Paris, at Naples, at Brussels, ifthey can afford to be in a Capital--if not, dispersed over Belgium,Switzerland, and Italy--retrenching in other countries, or living morecomfortably upon their incomes.  How many millions, for it does amountto millions, are now spent on the continent, enriching the people ofother countries, and in all probability laying up for those countriesthe sinews for another war to be directed against England!  How much ofwretchedness and starvation has been suffered in our own country withinthese few years, which, if our people had not been living abroad, mightnever have been felt!  Where are the elite of our aristocracy?  Whereare our country gentlemen who used to keep open house at their estates,disseminating their wealth and producing happiness?  All driven abroad--society disjointed--no leader of fashion to set the example, byluxurious entertainments, of disseminating that wealth which ultimatelyfinds its way into the greasy pocket of the labourer or mechanic.  Shopsopened late and closed early.  Gin palaces, like hell, ever open to acustomer.  The pulse of London hardly beats--it is perceptible, but nomore.  Nothing is active but the press, and the pressure from without.But who would remain ten days in London in the month of November, whenhe can go away, without he had serious thoughts of suicide?  Candles athigh noon, yellow fogs, and torches in mid-day, do not suit me, so I'moff again to a purer atmosphere.CHAPTER TWENTY TWO.                                                           Spa, June 30.Yesterday I fell in with two old friends, who, from a mere "truantdisposition," joined perhaps with a little good will towards me, cameover to Spa.  As soon as their arrival had been announced, I went tothem, and at their request joined their dinner.  After our firstgreetings, B--, who not only appears, but really is, a man of fashion,in the best sense of the term, wanted his snuff-box.  It was in hisbed-room, and his bed-room was locked by the servant, who had taken thekey and gone out.  The consequence was, that B-- had to wait some time,and until the man came back.  I have always had a great aversion to avalet when constantly moving about on the Continent, as a single man;and, although I do not now, as I used to do when a midshipman, brush myown clothes and black my own shoes, yet I like independence, in everything, and infinitely prefer doing anything myself, to being waitedupon; for, generally speaking, it is the master who waits and not theman."I wonder you bother yourself with such a travelling appendage, B--,"observed I, giving him a pinch of snuff to quiet his impatience.  "Ihave never lately travelled with one.""My dear fellow--the comfort of it--you have no idea.  It would beimpossible to get on without one.""Quite impossible," observed W--, my other acquaintance."I have been brought up in a school in which the word impossible hasbeen erased from the language.""Well, but the comfort of it.  When you arrive, dirty and dusty, yourportmanteau opened, all your articles of dress laid out.""I can do all that myself sooner than he can; and, as I must wait tillit be done, I may as well do it myself.""Yes, so you may, but then the security; every thing locked up, which,in a strange hotel, is so necessary."I lock my own room, and know where to find the key when I come in."Very likely; but still it is impossible to travel comfortably without avalet.""Quite impossible," rejoined W--."Be it so," replied I; "we differ in opinion.  All I can say is, thatnecessary as a valet is when stationary, he is a nuisance when youtravel _en garcon_."The conversation dropped, and we sat down to dinner; the time passedaway, as it always does, when old friends, who respect and like eachother, meet, after an absence of some months.  After dinner we smokedcigars; and, as the evening advanced, there were none left on the table.B-- rang the bell for his servant to procure others; the servant hadgone out and was no where to be found, and for _security_ had locked thebed-room door and taken the key with him.  So we drank our claret, andwaited for his return.  "Thinks I to myself"--but I said nothing.  Atlast, we waited till past twelve o'clock; but the gentleman's gentlemanwas no where to be found.  B-- was angry with the man, W-- had thrownhimself on the sofa.  He wished to go to bed after a long day's travel;but his key was also, for security, in the valet's pocket, who had beensearched for every where without success.  B-- begged me not to remainout of politeness; but I did remain not out of politeness, but of"_malice_," as the French term it.  "I had too much pleasure in theircompany to think of leaving them;" and we continued to sipbrandy-and-water.  At last, three o'clock came, B-- was out of allpatience, W-- snoring on the sofa, and I, quite delighted.  The sunshould have poured his beams upon us before I would have gone away.  Thebell was rung, but in vain, for the waiters would wait no longer.  Itwas proposed to send for a menuisier to pick the lock; but how was oneto be found at three o'clock in the morning?  At last the valet, drunkand reeling in his morning jacket, entered the room.  "The keys thekeys!" demanded B-- in wrath."The key!" roared W--, who had woke up."I have them," replied the valet, with a most knowing leer, facetiouslysmiling.  "I have them--all safe--all right, gentlemen.  Here they are,"continued the man, pulling them out, and presenting them as if he haddone a very clever thing.  "Here they are, you see."The man was too tipsy to be expostulated with, and the gentlemen tooktheir keys in silence.  "And now," said I, "gentlemen, I wish you a verygood night.  You have fully established the extreme _comfort_ of atravelling valet, and the impossibility of doing without one."  It was aglorious victory, although to get _out_ of the house I had to open awindow and leap from it, and to get _into_ my own house at that hour waseven more difficult.CHAPTER TWENTY THREE.I have been reading Jesse's "Gleanings."  Is he quite correct?  I havemy doubts.  In one point I certainly do not agree with him, in hisfavourite opinion of cats.  I do, however, know an instance of misplacedaffection in a cat, which, although it does not add to the moralcharacter of the race, is extremely curious for more reasons than one,and as it happened in my own family, I can vouch for its authenticity.A little black spaniel had five puppies, which were considered too manyfor her to bring up.  As, however, the breed was much in request, hermistress was unwilling that any of them should be destroyed, and sheasked the cook whether she thought it would be possible to bring aportion of them up by hand before the kitchen fire.  In reply, the cookobserved that the cat had that day kittened, and that, perhaps, thepuppies might be substituted for her progeny.  The experiment was made,two of the kittens were removed, and two puppies substituted.  The catmade no objections, took to them kindly, and gradually all the kittenswere taken away, and the cat nursed the two puppies only.  Now, thefirst curious fact was, that the two puppies nursed by the cat were, ina fortnight, as active, forward, and playful, as kittens would havebeen: they had the use of their legs, barked, and gambolled about; whilethe other three, nursed by the mother, were whining and rolling aboutlike fat slugs.  The cat gave them her tail to play with, and they werealways in motion; they very soon ate meat, and long before the othersthey were fit to be removed.  This was done, and the cat became veryinconsolable.  She prowled about the house, and on the second day oftribulation fell in with the little spaniel, who was nursing the otherthree puppies."O ho!" says Puss, putting up her back, "it is you who have stolen mychildren.""No," replied the Spaniel, with a snarl, "they are my own flesh andblood.""That won't do," said the cat, "I'll take my oath before any justice ofpeace that you have my two puppies."Thereupon issue was joined, that is to say, there was a desperatecombat, which ended in the defeat of the spaniel, and the cat walkingproudly off with one of the puppies, which she took to her own bed.Having deposited this one, she returned, fought again, gained anothervictory, and redeemed another puppy.  Now it is very singular that sheshould have only taken two, the exact number she had been deprived of.Does this not prove to a certain extent the power of calculating numbersin animals? and does not the precocity of the two puppies brought up bythe cat, infer there is some grounds for the supposition that with themilk is imbued much of the nature and disposition of the mother?  A fewexperiments made on these points would be interesting, and we shouldhave a new science, that of _lacteology_, to add to craniology, in ournurture and rearing of the species.This reminds me of a singular fact, little known.  The Burmahs, who aredisciples of Gaudma, equally with the inhabitants of Pegu and Syriam,whose country they have conquered, worship the White Elephant, who isconsidered as a god.  There have been but three white elephants sincethe foundation of the Burmah dynasty by Alompraa.  The first one isdead, and I have one of his teeth carved with figures, which wasconsecrated to the great Dagon Pagoda.  The second now _reigns_--he isattended by hundreds, wears a howdah, or cloth, studded with preciousstones; which is said to be worth a million of money.  He also wears hisbangles or armlets on each leg, and fares sumptuously every day.  Whiteelephants are very scarce; the colour is occasioned by a disease in theanimal, a species of leprosy.  Any elephant hunter in these countries,who is fortunate enough to capture a white elephant, is immediatelycreated a noble, and advanced to high honour and wealth.  The thirdwhite elephant, of which I am about to speak particularly, and who maybe considered as the heir apparent, was taken a few months previous toour declaring war against the Burmahs.  He was very young; his motherhad been killed, and he yet required partial nourishment.  He wasbrought to Rangoon, established in one of the best houses in the place,and an edict was sent forth from the capital, ordering that twenty-fourof the most healthy young married women should be dedicated to hiswants, and if they fell off in powers of nourishment, be replaced byothers.  This was considered an honour--for were they not nursing a_God_?  Major Canning, the political agent, who went to see this curiousspectacle, described it to me as follows: "The animal was not abovethree feet and a few inches high, its colour was a dirty grey, ratherthan white; it was very healthy, playful, and in good spirits.  When Iwent into the room, which was very spacious, and built of teak-wood, thetwenty-four nurses were sitting or lying on mats about the room, someplaying at draughts and other games, others working.  The elephantwalking about, looking at them, and what they were doing, as if heunderstood all about it.  After a short time, the little deity felthungry, and, with his trunk he pushed some of the women, but to annoyhim they would not yield to his solicitations.  When he became angry,and was too rough for them, they submitted, and he put his trunk roundtheir waists in the most affectionate manner, while he was supplyinghimself."  I did not see the animal myself, as immediately that theyheard of our arrival at the mouth of the river, they despatched himunder a strong guard to a place of security.  But I should like toascertain hereafter, whether his nurture made him a more reasonablebeing than are elephants in general.How one's thoughts fly away over time and space!  What a rush ofincidents crowd into my memory, merely from having mentioned thiscircumstance of the white elephant.  I did once intend to have written anarrative of what passed during our sojourn in that country, for I sawmore of the inhabitants than most people; but others have forestalledme, and it is now too late.  Nevertheless, it will perhaps amuse thereader, if, without entering into the military details, I mention a fewof the operations and scenes which then occurred.  It shall be so then,and we will discourse a little about the Burmahs.An Armenian merchant who resided there told me a story one day which wascurious.  The King of Pegu was possessed of the most splendid ruby inthe world, both as to size and colour.  This was well known; it was theboast of the nation.  When the Burmahs subdued the kingdom of Pegu, theold king with all his family were taken prisoners, vast treasure wasalso captured, but the great ruby was not to be found, notwithstandingthe torture and beheading of thousands.  With the usual barbarity ofthese countries, the old king, a miserable paralytic little man, wasstripped naked and confined in an iron cage, which I saw when I was atRangoon.  In this confinement he lived for ten or twelve years, everyfestival day being brought out and exposed to the derision of thepopulace.  At last he died, and his body was thrown out to be devouredby the dogs and birds of prey.  One of the soldiers who assisted to dragthe body out of the cage, turned it over with his foot, and perceivedthat his right hand grasped a hump of _damma_, (a sort of pitch,) whichcuriosity induced the Burmah to force out with the point of his spear.This had been observed before, but the Burmahs, who are verysuperstitions and carry about them all sorts of charms, imagined it tobe a charm for his paralysis or palsy with which he was afflicted, andtherefore had allowed him to retain it.  But when the Burmah took it up,the weight of it convinced him that it was not all damma: he examinedit, and found that it was the great ruby of the Pegu kingdom which hadbeen lost, and which the old man had for so many years, in a state ofnudity and incarceration, held in his left hand.  I asked one of theBurmah chiefs whether this ruby now in the possession of the King of Avawas so fine as represented: his answer was in truly Easternhyperbole--"Dip it in the Irrawaddy," said he, (that is, an enormousriver seven hundred miles long and in many parts several miles broad,)"and the whole water will turn to blood."I have said that the Burmahs are very superstitious: they have a greatvariety of charms which they wear about their persons, but there is onecustom of theirs which is very singular.  They polish rubies; that is,without cutting them in _facettes_, but merely the stone, whatever itsprimitive shape, is rubbed down on every side until it is perfectlysmooth.  They then make an incision in the flesh, generally the arm orleg, put in the ruby and allow the skin to heal over it, so that thestone remains there.  Soldiers and sailors in search of plunder willfind out any thing, and this practice of the Burmahs was soondiscovered; and after the assault and carrying of a stockade, you wouldsee the men passing their hands over the bodies, and immediately theyfelt a rising in the limb, out with their knives and cut in for therubies.  Indeed, the plunder was more considerable than might beimagined, for every Burmah carried all his wealth about his person.Another singular custom arising from their superstition prevails amongthis people.  The king has a corps denominated _Invulnerables_, whoseranks are filled up in this manner:--when a criminal is condemned todeath for certain offences, such as robbery, he is permitted tochallenge as an _invulnerable_.  This is proved by his standing at acertain distance from several men who fire at him with ball.  Should henot be wounded or killed, he is pronounced an invulnerable and enrolledin the corps.  In every stockade we attacked, there were always one ortwo of these men, and they really appeared to believe in their ownpowers.  They generally stood above the timbers of the stockade, dancingand capering as the boats advanced, and continued their extravaganceamidst a shower of bullets, exposing their persons in a most undauntedmanner.  There was one fellow who, dressed in a short red jacket, andnothing else except the cloth round his loins, who was well known to ourmen; they called him _Happy Jack_, from the capers which he used to cut,and somehow or another it was his good fortune never to be hit, atleast, not that we know of, for taking stockade after stockade, at everyfresh attack there was Happy Jack to be seen capering and shouting asusual, and never ceasing to expose himself until the troops had landedand were about to scale the fortress.  It was quite amusing to hear themen shout out with laughter, "By heavens, there's Happy Jack again."  Ihope he is alive at this moment; at all events, he deserves to be.CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.                                                                    Spa.Yes, now Spa is agreeable: we have no _redoubte_ open with fools losingtheir money, no English _passants_ looking after amusement, novaletudinarians drinking the _poupon_, no Spa boxes crowding everywindow: we are now as a Spa should be, a _coterie_ of houses in aravine, surrounded by the mountains of the Ardennes, crowding andshoving up together in mutual protection against the deep snow and theforest wolves.  There is something new in this: most of the houses areshut up; the shop-windows are all bare; the snow is two feet deep in thestreets; the mountains on every side are white; the icicles hang uponthe leafless boughs, and the rivulets are enchained.  All is one drearblank; and except the two-horse diligence which heaves slowly in sightthree or four hours past its time, and the post, (which is now deliveredat nine o'clock instead of noon); there is no such thing as an arrival:the boys slide upon their little sledges down the hills; the cattle aredriven home; the church clock strikes; and unless we are enlivened bythe crowd assembled round the countryman, who appears with the carcassof a wolf which he has been fortunate enough to kill, we are all quiet,monotony and peace: in fact, Spa, now that it is a desert, has become tome, at least agreeable.They say, this hard winter promises plenty of wolves; if so, I recommendthose who are fond of excitement come here.  Indeed, it will beprofitable, for if they are active huntsmen, they can pay theirexpenses.  A dead horse costs little, and in Spa, as they give verylittle to the horses to eat in summer, and nothing at all in the winter,they die fast.  You have only to drag the carcass to an outhouse at alittle distance from the town, and with your rifle watch during thenight.  The wolves will come down to prey upon the carrion, and it ishard if you do not kill your couple during the night, and then you arerewarded by the commune.  I do not know what the price is now, but whenthe King of Holland was in possession of Belgium it was one hundredfrancs for a male, and three hundred francs for a female wolf.  Now abrace a night, four hundred francs, or sixteen pounds, is not a badnight's earning: in Spa it would keep a half-pay officer for threemonths.  There is a curious story here, proving the sagacity of a wolfwhich came down an hour before dusk into the town, and made off with achild of two years old in her mouth.  The cry was raised, and thepursuit immediate.  After following her track for many miles, she gainedupon them, it became quite dark, and the people returned homewards,melancholy at the fate of the poor child.  When they were about half wayback, they heard the wail of an infant, and, guided by it, they arrivedat a thick bush, where they found the child alive and unhurt.  The wolf,finding that her pursuers gained upon her, had deposited the childthere, intending to return and make a meal of it upon a more favourableopportunity.We have had nothing to excite us within these last few days but thedeath and burial of an old curate.  He died in all the odour of sanctitythree days ago, and was buried yesterday.  He was not loved or evenliked, for he wanted that greatest of all gifts--charity.  His situationwas worth, with offerings, six thousand francs a year,--a large sum inthis country: but he did not give to the poor; he exacted from them, andthey religiously obeyed him, no one killing a pig or anything elsewithout a present of part of it to the curate.  When the old man wastold that he could not live, the ruling passion still governed him.  Hesent for a person to dispose of for him the sundry pieces of pork whichhe had gathered as presents, then took the extreme unction, and died.His will is not known, but he is supposed to be very rich, and whetherhe leaves his wealth to some nephews, or to support a hospital herewhich is at present without funds, is a question of some interest.  Hewas buried in great parade and procession, followed by hundreds holdingcandles.  He was dressed in his best, and every one said that he neverlooked so clean or so well in his life.  He was carried on an open_brancard_, with his canonical hat on his head, the snow fell fast andsettled on his face and clothes, but he felt it not.  The funeral was ascold as his charity, the thermometer being exactly 130 below thefreezing point.  Except the procession of the dead curate and of a deadwolf, we have had nothing to interest us for the last ten days.But I promised to talk about the Burmahs.  There have been two or threeaccounts of the military movements, but there has been no inquiry orexamination into the character of the people, which, in my opinion, isof more importance than is generally supposed; for although the EastIndia Company may imagine that they have done with the Burmahs, it is myconviction that the Burmahs have not done with them, and even I may liveto witness the truth of my assertion.It certainly is a point of some interest to ascertain from whence theBurmah nation originally came: that they are not aborigines, I thinkmost certain.  They are surrounded by the Cochin Chinese, the Chinese,and the Hindoos, all races of inferior stature and effeminate in person,with little or no beard.  Now the Burmahs are a very powerful race, verymuscular in their limbs, possessing great strength and energy: generallyspeaking, I should say, that they are rather taller than Europeans.They have the high cheek bones of the Tatar, but not the small eyes;they have strong hair and beards, and certainly would remind you of across between the Jew and the Tatar.  This is singular; and it gave theidea to some of those who are fond of indulging in theory, that theymight be the remnants of that portion of the Jews who, when permitted toleave Babylon, instead of going east with the others, bent their courseto the westward and were never spoken of afterwards.  But the only propsthey had to this argument were the appearance of the people, the weightin silver being called the _tekel_ or shekel, and the great pagodahaving the name of the _Dagon_ pagoda.  At least I heard of no more tosupport the argument but those three, which can hardly be sufficient,although the coincidence of the two words is singular.The Burmahs are semi-barbarous: but this term must be used in the mostfavourable light; because, surrounded on every side by people who arewedded to their own customs, the Burmahs have a liberality and a desireto improve, which is very remarkable.  I never met with any Burmah, noteven a lad, who could not read and write; they allow any form ofreligion to be made use of, and churches of any description to be builtby foreigners, but they do not like missionaries making converts oftheir own people; for as the king is the head of the religion,conversion is a breach of allegiance.  One of the missionaries had anaudience with the king, and demanded permission to make proselytes.  Theking replied that the missionary might convert as many as he pleased,but that he would cut all their heads off afterwards.  The missionaryhad not much trouble, when this answer was made known, in counting theheads of his proselytes.  In their own religion, which is Budhism, theBurmahs appear to be very relax; it is too absurd for the energy oftheir minds.  Those who enter the priesthood wear a yellow dress; but ifa priest at any time feels disposed to quit his profession, he is atliberty so to do.  All he has to do is to throw off his yellow garment;but at the same time he can never resume it.  The Burmahs aresuperstitious about charms, but are not superstitious on religiouspoints.  In fact, there is very little religion among them, and had we,at the close of the war, instead of demanding a crore of rupees,insisted that they should embrace Christianity, the king would havegiven the order, and the whole nation would have nominally beenChristians.  I once asked a Burmah soldier what was his idea of a futurestate.  His idea of bliss was singular--"I shall be turned into abuffalo, and shall lie down in a meadow of grass higher than my head,and eat all day long, and there won't be a single mosquito to annoy me."While on the subject of religion, I may here observe, that at thecapture of Rangoon I entered a Chinese temple, the altar-piece, if I mayuse the term, was the Ganesa of the Hindoos, but not seated on the lotusleaf, but on the Chinese rat.  On each side of this were two littlecandelabras, formed of the Egyptian ibis, holding the oil cups in itsbeak.  I also found the Hounyman, or monkey god of the Hindoos, andBudhist figures.  I once observed some sepoys playing and laughing at abronze image they had picked up at the pagoda of Syriam, and onexamining it, I was surprised to find that it was a figure of theEgyptian Isis, with her hand raised, and her person in the positiondescribed as the correct one when blessing the world.  The art ofembalming appears to be known to the Burmahs, and is occasionallypractised by the priests.  At the capture of the old Portuguese fort atSyriam, I found, not far from it, a sort of canopied shed, decoratedwith carving, cut paper, and tinsel, and supported by four pillars, likea bedstead.  Below lay the body of a priest, embalmed and gilt.  Iintended to have brought this home, but before I arrived there, I foundone of my marines, a graceless dog without religion or any other goodquality, very busy hammering the mummy to pieces with the butt end ofhis musket.  I was very angry, and ordered him to desist.  In excuse, hereplied that it was an abominable molten image, and it was his duty, asa _good Christian_, to destroy it--the only evidence of Christianityever witnessed on that fellow's part.  On examination, I found that thebody had been wrapped in sundry clothes, and, like the ark of Noah,pitched within and without: over the clothes was a coat of damma, thenof chunam, and lastly it was gilt; the head of the mummy was fictitious,and formed of a cocoa-nut, the real skull being where, in the mummy,would have appeared to have been the breast of the body.  It did notsmell much, but there were a great many small scarabei inside, and itwas so mutilated that I did not remove it.  The Burmahs are cleanly intheir houses, which generally are raised from the ground a few feet, soas to allow the pigs; which are the scavengers of the town, to walkunder.  They have houses of brick, or stone and mortar, such as thecustom-house at Rangoon, and one or two others; but the most substantialhouses are usually built of thick teak plank.  The smaller houses andcottages are built of bamboo, the floors and walls being woven likewicker-work: the cleanliness and the beauty of these houses when new arevery remarkable, and what is still more so, the rapidity with which theyare built.  I have known an officer order a house to be built of threerooms, with doors and windows to each, and of a comfortable size, andthree or four Burmahs will complete this house in a day, and thatch theroof over.  In another point, the Burmahs show a degree of civilisation,which might be an example to the northern Athens--to every house thereis a very neat and clean cloaca.The government, like all in Asia, is most despotic; and the people havethe faults which are certain to be generated by despotism--but not tothat degree which might be expected.  They have their hereditarynobility, and the orders of it are very clearly defined.  They consistof gold chains, worn round the neck, with four plates or chased bossesdividing them; the lowest order wears the bosses linked together bythree chains, the next highest in degree with six, the next nine, andthe last and highest order has twelve; the king only wears twenty-fourchains.  The use of gold and silver, as drinking cups, etcetera, is onlypermitted to the nobility.  They are very clever in chasing of metals,and they have a description of work in glass and enamel, quite theirown, with which they decorate the temples, houses of the priests, andcoffers containing the sacred volumes.  Their ornamental writings in thePali language, a variety of the Sanscrit, known only to the priests, arealso very beautiful--especially that upon long leaves of ivory.  Uponthe whole, their manufactures are superior to all around them, exceptperhaps the Chinese.The women are small, and delicately formed, in proportion to the men;they are not shut up, but go where they please; their dress is becoming;they braid the hair with flowers, and they are much fairer than would besupposed.  Those who keep much within doors are nearly as white asEuropeans.  They have a singular custom of putting a patch of whitechunam on the cheek bone, something in opposition to the black patcheswhich used formerly to be worn by our belles; and it is intended to showhow near they approach to white.  Indeed, when the men of the lowerclass, who are exposed all day to the sun, remove their garments, it issingular to witness how many shades lighter they are in that part oftheir bodies which is covered up.  Usually, the men have but one wife,but occasionally there are supernumeraries.The laws of the Burmahs appear to be good, but, as in all despoticcountries, they are not acted upon, unless it please the ruler.  Slaveryof a certain species is allowed.  Should one man be in debt to another,and is summoned before the chief; if he states his inability to pay, heis asked how many children he has, and according to the debt, so are hischildren given in bond slavery to his debtor, who writes off a certainsum every year until they are free.  If he has no children, his wife, orhimself perhaps, will be bonded in the same manner.  But in this case,where ill-treatment can be proved, the bondage will be removed; andfurther, any person so bonded, may at his or her wish remove to theservice of another master, provided they can find one who will pay tothe debtor the amount still due, and thus finish the time of servitudeunder one whom they like better.  These bonds are all in writing, andmust be produced.  Some of our military officers released several of theyoung women from their slavery._Sitting down_ in your presence, is, among the Burmese, a mark ofrespect.  Every poor man who is sent for, immediately drops down on hishams in the corner of the room, or at the portal.  The use of the cocoa,or betel nut, is universal among the men, but not so common with thewomen until they grow old.  The consequence is, that the teeth of themen are quite black and decayed, while those of the young women are verygood.The most remarkable feature in the character of the Burmahs is their_good temper_; I think they are the most even-tempered race, ever metwith.  They are always gay, always content under any privation.  I had,as will be seen hereafter, more opportunities of seeing into thecharacter of this people than others had, for we mixed with them inamity for some weeks.  They are very fond of marionettes, and puppetplaying, and are very amusing mimics.  They work very hard, and with thegreatest cheerfulness.  They have a high respect for the English, or thewhite faces, as they call us; and the superiority of our warlikeinstruments, and our ships, _was_ a subject of wonder, and, at the sametime, of most careful examination.  They perceive how far they arebehind us, and are most anxious to improve.  From this reason, joined toothers, it was a pity that we ever made war with the Burmahs; they hadmade an easy conquest of those around them, and were satisfied withtheir supposed superiority, but now they are not, for they are activeand enterprising, fond of war, and will not be content until they haveimproved their system.  Twenty years hence we shall find the Burmahs amuch more formidable nation than they are at present, for they haveevery quality necessary to become the first nation in the East: indeed,when we consider with what weapons they defended themselves, and thenature of the warfare, it is not a little to their credit that they heldout for nearly three years against the power of Great Britain.CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.                                                         February, 1836.The Burmahs are decidedly a brave nation: the government being despotic,their rulers are cruel, but the people are not.  I state this, ascowardice and cruelty usually go hand in hand.  Good temper andgenerosity are the prominent features in their character--excellentmaterials to work upon in judicious hands.  I witnessed acts of courageat the early part of the war, before the Burmahs found out howimpossible it was to cope with our superior arms, which were mostsurprising, and which excited our admiration.  They are peculiarly awarlike nation; indeed, they are fond of war.  Every man is a soldier,and when ordered out to join the ranks, obeys without receiving any pay,providing his own arms.  This fact, at once, establishes that they areinclined to war.  Their aims generally consist of a double-handed sword,a weapon of great force, and very large spears; but every one willpossess a musket if he can, and if it has not a lock, he will fire itwith a match.  It is in this point that the Burmahs are so deficient inaims: we used to consider it a very courageous act to venture to fireoff a Burmese musket, they were in such a wretched condition: and tocrown all, every man _makes his own gunpowder_.  Now it may be easilyimagined what stuff this must be; as, previous to an expected combat,each Burmah sits down and composes the article to the best of hisknowledge and belief.  The consequences are, that when these muskets dogo off (and it is ten to one they do not), it is again ten to one thatthe bullet falls short, from the inefficacy of the powder.  There isanother singular fact, and one which proves that they have been used tomuskets but a short time: it is, that they have no bullet-moulds orleaden bullets.  All their bullets are of iron, hammered as round asthey can hammer them at the forge; of course the windage produced bythis imperfect shape, occasions it to deviate much from its intendeddirection.The guns on their stockades and war-boats are equally defective from badpowder, and the hammered iron bullets.  It is difficult to know wherethey could have collected such a curious assemblage.  Sometimes you willfall in with a small brass piece of exquisite Spanish manufacture, atothers you will find them of the strangest forms that can be conceived.I rather think they were purchased, or taken as a part of the duties onvessels trading to Rangoon.  I recollect once at the first taking of astockade, we knocked off the trunnions of an old iron gun, and left itthere as useless.  The Burmahs reoccupied the stockade, and we had totake it a second time, when we found that they had most ingeniouslysupplied the want of trunnions with iron hoops and rivets, and the gunwas fired at us before we entered.  At another time, we entered astockade which had kept up a brisk fire for a few minutes, and to oursurprise found that they had made _wooden_ guns, very well bound andbraced with iron hoops.  Of course these guns would not fire more thantwo or three shots each, as the touch-holes became inflamed, and weresoon so large as to render the guns unserviceable; but I mention thesepoints, to prove the perseverance of these people, and the efforts theymade in their own defence.  After the first campaign it is true thatthey deserted, and the levies were made by force; but the reason ofthis, for I inquired into it, was not that they had any objection tofight, but that, fighting without pay, they wanted to go home and putthe seed into the ground, as otherwise their wives and families wouldstarve.The Burmah war-boats are very splendid craft, pulling from eighty to onehundred oars; the Burmahs manage them very dexterously, and will pullthem from seven to eight miles an hour.  They have a war-boat dedicatedto the Deity, which brought intelligence that saved the nation at thetime of the war with the empire of Pegu, in a space of time so short, asalmost to appear incredible.As I before observed, the gun mounted on the boat's bow is of littleeffect, but their spears are really formidable.  At a night attack uponsome of our vessels, anchored off a stockade which they wanted toregain, I had an evidence of the force with which they are thrown.  Thesides of the vessels were covered with them, sticking out likeporcupine's quills, and they had entered the plank with such force, thatit required a very strong arm to pull them out again.  We lost some menby them; the effect of a hundred spears hurtling through the air at thesame time was singularly appalling to our men, who were not accustomedthe sound, especially during the night.  I heard several of the sailorsobserve afterwards that they "did not like that at all," and I am surethey would have infinitely preferred to have been met with fire-arms.Some of these spears were sixteen feet long, with an iron head, sharp atboth sides, weighing from twelve to fourteen pounds.  I have seen bowsand arrows in the possession of the Burmahs, but never have observedthat they used them in their conflicts with us.  They appeared todespise them.  The system of warfare and defence pursued by thesepeople, is undoubtedly excellent for the peculiarities of the country.Their stockades are usually built of any thick teak timber, or rathersquared trees, which are much too strong to be penetrated by any otherthan battering cannon, and, in consequence, were invariably carried byescalade.  Some of them are built of bamboos, running from a foot to twofeet in diameter.  These are equally strong, with the peculiarity thatif you fire cannon at them the bamboos yield, admit the shot, and thenclose again.  If these stockades are not close to the river side, theyusually have a deep ditch round them, and are further protected by whatwas more serious to us than the escalading, which were abbatis ofpointed bamboos, stuck in a slanting direction in the ground.  Theslight wounds made by these bamboos brought on lock-jaw, and too oftenterminated fatally.  In the attacks upon us at Rangoon they made theirapproaches with some degree of military skill, throwing up trenches asthey advanced.  Their fire-rafts on such a rapid river were alsoformidable.  They have wells of petroleum up the country: their raftswere very large, and on them, here and there, were placed old canoesfilled with this inflammable matter.  When on fire, it blazed as high asour maintop, throwing out flames, heat, and stink quite enough to driveany one away.I have mentioned their mode of warfare and their deficiencies, to provethat if the Burmahs had been as well provided with every species of armsequal to our own, the country would not have been so soon subjugated asit was.  Their system of defence was good, their bravery was undoubted,but they had no effective weapons.  I strongly suspect that they will,now that they have been taught their inferiority, use every means toobtain them; and if so, they will really become a formidable nation.  Asone proof of their courage, I will mention, that at every stockade thereis a look-out man, perched on a sort of pole, about ten feet or moreclear of the upper part of the stockade, in a situation completelyexposed.  I have often observed these men, and it was not till thecannonade had fairly commenced on both sides, that they came down, andwhen they did, it was without hurry; indeed, I may say, in a mostleisurely and indifferent manner.  Of their invulnerables and theirantics I have already spoken.In countries governed despotically, life is not so much valued as it isin others.  The very knowledge that it may be taken in a moment at thewill of the rulers, renders even the cowardly comparatively indifferent.Having been accustomed from our earliest years to anticipate an event,when it actually arrives we meet it with composure and indifference.The lad in England who is brought up to thieving, and who is continuallyreminded by his parents, that he _must be hung_ before he is twenty goesto the gallows when his turn comes with much _sang froid_.  So it is ina despotic country, where the people witness the heads of theircompanions roll on the ground, and surmise how soon their own turn willcome.  I had more than one evidence of this during my stay.  In oneinstance I wished to obtain information from a prisoner, but couldextract none.  He had been sitting between the carronades on deck fortwenty-four hours, and some of the men or officers had given him a bowlof grog and a couple of cigars, with which he was busy when Iinterrogated him.  As he professed ignorance, I told him that if hewould not give me the desired information, I should take his head off;and I sent for the serjeant of marines, who appeared with two of hisparty, and with his drawn sword.  We called him out from between theguns, but he begged through the interpreter to be allowed to finish hisgrog, to which I consented: when that was done, he was again orderedout, but requested leave to finish about an inch of cigar which remainedin his mouth.  To which I also acceded, not being in a particular hurryto do that which I never intended to do.  During all this the man wasperfectly composed, and did not show the least alarm at his approachingfate.  As soon as the cigar was finished, he bound his long hair upafresh, and made preparation.  I again asked him if he would tell, buthe pleaded ignorance, and stepped forward, went down on his knees andtook off the cloth from about his loins, which he spread on the deck toreceive his head, and then putting his hands on the deck, held it in theposition to be cut off.  Not a muscle trembled, for I watched the mancarefully.  He was, of course, remanded, and the sailors were so pleasedwith him, that he went on shore with more grog and more tobacco than hehad probably ever seen in his life.The Burmahs have, however, a means of extracting information from spies,etcetera, which I never saw practised by them, although it was borrowedfrom them by us.  It was in our own quarter-master-general's office thatI witnessed this species of torture, so simple in its operation, andapparently so dreadful in its effects.  It consists in giving one singleblow upon the region of the heart, so as to stop for some seconds thewhole circulation.  The way by which this is effected is as follows:--the man--the Burmahs are generally naked to the waist--is made to sitdown on the floor; another man stands behind him, and leaning over him,takes a very exact aim with his sharp bent elbow at the precise spotover his heart, and then strikes a blow which, from its being propelledso very mechanically, descends with increased force.The effect appears dreadful; the dark hue of the sufferer's face turnsto a deadly white; the perspiration bursts out from his forehead, and hetrembles in every limb.  I never witnessed such apparent agony.  Theseblows repeated three or four times, will unman the most resolute, andthey will call for death as a favour.There is one point which must not be overlooked by the Indiangovernment, and which, connected with what I have already mentioned,makes the Burmese nation more formidable; it is, the great contempt theyhave for the sepoys.  And what is equally true, the fears which thesepoys have of them.  The Burmahs are only afraid of the white faces, asI shall very soon establish.  They despise the sepoys, although they areso well armed.  Now, that the sepoys are good troops, there can be nodoubt; they have proved it often; but, at the same time, they are not,as some of the Indian officers have asserted in my presence, the besttroops in the world, and preferable to Europeans.  That they are mucheasier to control, and that they excel in discipline, I grant, becausethey are never intoxicated; but they have, in the first place, verylittle stamina, and are, generally speaking, a small and veryeffeminately built race.  Still they have fought well--very well; butthey never fought well against the Burmahs; and for this simplereason,--that superstition is more powerful than courage, and subduesit.  The sepoys are very superstitious, and had the idea, which wasnever eradicated, that the Burmahs were _charmed men_, and they neverwent out against them willingly, even when they were headed by theEnglish troops.  As for the Burmahs' contempt of them, it was notorious.I have myself seen one of the Burmah prisoners at Rangoon lift up apiece of timber that six of the sepoys could hardly have moved, andthrow it down, so as to make it roll at the feet of the sepoy guard whowatched him, making them all retreat several paces, and then laugh atthem in derision.  But we had many more decisive proofs.  The Burmahshad stockaded themselves about seven miles from Rangoon, and it wasdetermined to dislodge them.  Colonel S--, who was very partial to thenative troops, was ordered on this service, and he requestedparticularly that he might have no troops but the sepoys.  Sir ACampbell did not much like to consent, but, as the stockades were nothigher than breastworks, and the Burmahs not in very great force, heeventually yielded to the Colonel's arguments.  Fifteen hundred sepoyswere ordered out, and the Colonel went on his expedition.  The Burmahshad good intelligence that there were no European troops, and when thesepoys arrived, they did not wait to be attacked, but attacked thesepoys, and put them completely to the rout.  One half of the sepoyswere said to be killed; the others came back to Rangoon in parties often or twelve, and in the utmost consternation and confusion.  Sir ACampbell was, of course, much annoyed, and the next day a European forcewas despatched against the Burmahs.  On their arrival they witnessed adreadful and disgusting scene.  A long avenue had been cut in the wood,and on each side of it were hung by the heels, at equal distances,shockingly mutilated, the naked bodies of the seven hundred and fiftysepoys killed.  The Burmahs did not, however, attempt to resist theEuropean force, but after a few shots made their retreat.  Now, this isa very important fact: and it is a fact which cannot be denied, althoughit has not been made known.  In India there is a nominal force of threehundred thousand men; but they are scattered over such a vast extent ofterritory, that, allowing they could be made disposable, which theycould not, it would require many months before they could be collected,and if the Burmahs despise the sepoys, and the sepoys dread the Burmahs,the only check against the latter will be the European troops; and ofthem how many can be called out.  Not ten thousand, at the very utmost;and the difficulty of collecting them was well known at the commencementof the Burmah war.  There certainly is a great difference betweenattacking others in their own territories, and defending ourselves; butif the Burmahs could hold out against us, as they did, for nearly threeyears, without arms to cope with us, what might be the consequence ifthey were supplied with arms and officers by any other nation?  We havenow a footing in the country, and it must be our object to prevent theingress of any other, and to keep the Burmahs as quiet and as peaceableas we can.  But our very intercourse will enlighten them by degrees, andwe have more to dread from that quarter than from all the hordes ofRussia or Runjeet Sing, and the whole disaffection of India.As I have more to say relative to the Burmahs, I will, in my nextchapter, enter into a short narrative of the expedition to Bassein.  Itwas a bloodless one, although very important in its results: andcircumstances occurred in it which will throw much light upon thecharacter of the nation.CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.It was not until many months after the war had been carried on, that SirArchibald Campbell found himself in a position to penetrate into theheart of the Burmah territory, and attempt the capital.  He wantedalmost every thing, and among the rest reinforcements of men; for therainy season had swept them off by thousands.  At last, when determinedto make the attempt, he did it with a most inadequate force; so smallthat, had the Burmahs thought of even trenching up and barricading theroads at every half mile, he must have been compelled, without firing ashot, to have retreated.  Fortunately, he had an accession ofmen-of-war, and his river detachment was stronger than he could havehoped for.  I do not pretend to state the total force which was embarkedon the river or that which proceeded by hand, communicating with eachother when circumstances permitted, as the major part of the provisionsof the army were, I believe, carried up by water.  The united riverforce was commanded by Brigadier Cotton, Captain Alexander, and CaptainChads; the land forces, of course, by Sir A Campbell, who had excellentofficers with him, but whose tactics were of no use in this warfare ofmorass, mud, and jungle.It will be proper to explain why it was considered necessary to detach apart of the forces to Bassein.  The Rangoon river joins the Irrawaddy onthe left, about one hundred and seventy miles from its flowing into theocean.  On the right of the Irrawaddy is the river of Bassein, the mouthof it about one hundred and fifty miles from that of the Irrawaddy, andrunning up the country in an angle towards it until it joins it aboutfour hundred miles up in the interior.  The two rivers thus enclose alarge delta of land, which is the most fertile and best peopled of theBurmah provinces, and it was from this delta that Bundoola, the Burmahgeneral, received all his supplies of men.  Bundoola was in the strongfortress of Donabue, on the Bassein side of the river, about half waybetween where the Rangoon river joined it on the left, and the Basseinriver communicated with it a long way farther up on the right.  Sir ACampbell's land forces were on the left of the river, so that Bundoola'scommunication with the Bassein territory was quite open; and as theriver forces had to attack Donabue on their way up, the force sent toBassein, was to take him in the rear and cut off his supplies.  This wasa most judicious plan of the General's, as will be proved in the sequel.Major S--, with four or five hundred men in three transports, theLarne, and the Mercury, Hon.  Company's brig, were ordered upon thisexpedition, which sailed at the same time that the army began to marchand the boats to ascend the river.On the arrival at the mouth of the river we found the entrance mostformidable in appearance, there being a dozen or more stockades of greatextent; but there were but two manned, the guns of the others, as wellas the men, having been forwarded to Donabue, the Burmahs not imagining,as we had so long left that part of their territory unmolested, that weshould have attempted it.  Our passage was therefore easy; after a fewbroadsides, we landed and spiked the guns, and then, with a fair wind,ran about seventy miles up one of the most picturesque and finest riversI was ever in.  Occasionally the right lines of stockades presentedthemselves, but we found nobody in them, and passed by them in peace.But the river now became more intricate, and the pilots, as usual, knewnothing about it.  It was, however, of little consequence; the river wasdeep even at its banks, over which the forest trees threw their boughsin wild luxuriance.  The wind was now down the river, and we were two orthree days before we arrived at Bassein, during which we tided andwarped how we could, while Major S-- grumbled.  If the reader wishes toknow why Major S-- grumbled, I will tell him--because there was nofighting.  He grumbled when we passed the stockades at the entrance ofthe river because they were not manned; and he grumbled at everydismantled stockade that we passed.  But there was no pleasing S--; ifhe was in hard action and not wounded, he grumbled; if he received aslight wound, he grumbled because it was not a severe one; if a severeone, he grumbled because he was not able to fight the next day.  He hadbeen nearly cut to pieces in many actions, but he was not content.  Likethe man under punishment, the drummer might strike high or strike low,there was no pleasing S--: nothing but the _coup de grace_, if he be nowalive, will satisfy him.  But notwithstanding this mania for beingcarved, he was an excellent and judicious officer.  I have been told heis since dead; if so, his Majesty has lost one of the most devoted andchivalric officers in his service, to whom might most justly be appliedthe words of Hotspur,--"But if it be a sin to covet honour, I am themost offending soul alive."  [See note 1.]As I before observed, the branches of the trees hung over the sides ofthe river, and a circumstance occurred which was a source of greatamusement.  We had a little monkey, who had been some time on board, andwas a favourite, as usual, of the ship's company.  The baffling windsvery often threw us against the banks of the river, near which there wasplenty of water; and when this was the case, the boughs of the treeswere interlaced with the rigging of the ship.  This unusual embracingbetween nature and art gave Jacko the idea of old times when hefrolicked in the woods, and unable to resist the force of earlyassociations, he stepped from the top-sail yard to the branch of a largetree, and when the ship had hauled off clear, we found that Jacko haddeserted.  We lamented it, and ten minutes afterwards, thinking no moreabout him, we continued our course up the river.  About an hour hadelapsed, during which we had gained upwards of a mile, when againnearing the bank on that side, we heard a loud chattering and screaming."That's Jacko, sir," said one of the men, and others expressed the sameopinion.  We manned the jolly-boat, and sent it on shore towards theplace where the noise was heard.  The monkey did not wait till the bowof the boat touched the shore, but springing into it when some feet off,he took his seat very deliberately on the stern, and was pulled onboard, where immediately he flew up the side, caressing every one hemet.  The fact was, that Jacko had found several of his own race in thewoods, but, like all wild animals, they immediately attacked one who hadworn the chains of servitude, and Jacko had to fly for his life.  Wevery often interlaced the rigging with the boughs after that, but themonkey remained quiet on the booms, and showed not the slightest wish torenew his rambles.I think it was on the third day that we arrived below the town ofNaputah, which was defended by a very formidable stockade, commandingthe whole reach of the river.  The stockade was manned, and we expectedthat it would be defended, but as we did not fire, neither did they; andwe should have passed it quietly, had not S-- grumbled so much at hisbad luck.  The next day we arrived at Bassein, one of the principaltowns in the Burman Empire.  Here again the Major was disappointed, forit appeared that, on hearing of the arrival of the expedition at theentrance of the river, the people had divided into two parties, one forresistance, the other for submission.  This difference of opinion hadended in their setting fire to the town and immense magazines of grain,dismantling the stockades, and the major part of the inhabitants flyinginto the country.  The consequence was, that we took possession of thesmoking ruins without opposition.It was soon observed that the people were tired of the protracted war,and of the desolation occasioned by it.  They wanted to return to theirwives and families, who were starving.  But up to this time the chiefshad remained faithful to Bundoola, who had amassed stores and provisionsat Bassein, intending to retreat upon it, should he be driven out of thefortress of Donabue; and as long as he held that fortress, receivingfrom Bassein his supplies of men and of provisions.  The Burmahs were sounwilling to fight any longer, that they were collected by armed bands,and made prisoners by the chiefs, who sent them up as required; and manyhundreds were still in this way detained, enclosed in stockaded ground,and watched by armed men, in several towns along the river.  Anexpedition was first despatched up the river, to its junction with theIrrawaddy, as there was a town there in which was the dockyard of theBurmahs, all their war boats, and _canoes_ of every description being_built_ at that place.  They ascended without difficulty, and, after alittle skirmishing, took possession of the place, burnt all the boatsbuilt or building, and then returned to Bassein.Of course, we had then nothing to do: Major S--'s orders were to joinSir A Campbell, if he possibly could; which, with much difficulty, heultimately effected.  We must now return to the Irrawaddy expeditionsent up at the same time that Sir A Campbell marched by land, and ourexpedition went up the Bassein river.This force arrived at Donabue before we had gained Bassein.  It found amost formidable fortress, or rather, three fortresses in one, mounting agreat number of guns, and, as I before observed, held by Bundoola, thecommander of the Burmah forces, in whom the Burmah troops placed thegreatest confidence.  I speak from hearsay and memory, but I believe Iam correct when I state that there were not less than ten thousand menin Donabue, besides war elephants, etcetera.  Now the river force didnot amount in fighting men certainly to one thousand, and they were notin sufficient strength to attack a place of this description, upon whichevery pains had been taken for a long while to render it impregnable.The attack was however made, and the smaller stockade of the threecarried; but when they had possession of the smallest stockade, theydiscovered that they were at the mercy of the second, and in a sort oftrap.  The consequence was, defeat--the only defeat experienced by thewhite troops during the whole war.  The troops were re-embarked, and theboats were obliged to drop down the river clear of the fire of the fort.I believe two hundred and fifty English troops were left dead in thestockade, and the next day their bodies, crucified on rafts, werefloated down among the English boats by the triumphant Bundoola.  In themeantime a despatch had been sent to Sir A Campbell, who was in advanceon the banks of the river; stating that the force afloat was not able tocope with the fortress, the real strength of which no one had been awareof.  The consequence was, that Sir A Campbell retraced his steps,crossed the river, and attacked it in conjunction with the flotilla, SirA Campbell taking it in the rear.  After some hard fighting, in whichthe elephants played their parts, the troops gained possession, andBundoola having been killed by a shell, the Burmahs fled.  Now it wasvery fortunate that the expedition had been sent to Bassein, forotherwise the Burmahs would have fallen back upon that place, which heldall their stores, and would thus have been able to continue in the rearof Sir A Campbell, as he advanced up the river.  But they had heard ofthe destruction and capture of Bassein, and consequently directed theirflight up the river towards the capital.  We were in possession of allthese circumstances shortly after we had taken possession of Bassein;and although the death of Bundoola and taking of Donabue had dispiritedthe Burmahs, yet there were many chiefs who still held out, and who, hadthey crossed with their troops to the Irrawaddy, would have interruptedthe supplies coming up, and the wounded and sick who were sent down.  Wehad, therefore, still the duty of breaking up these resources ifpossible.  Having ascertained who the parties were, we sent a message toone of the weakest to say, that if he did not tender his submission, andcome in to us, we should attack him, and burn the town to the ground.The chief thought it advisable to obey our summons, and sent word thathe would come in on the ensuing day.  He kept his promise: about noon,as we were sitting in the verandah of a large _Sammy_ house (a sort ofmonastery), which we had taken possession of, we were informed that hehad arrived.  The token of submission on the part of the Burmahs is,presenting the other party with _wax candles_.  If a poor man has arequest to make, or favour to ask of a great man, he never makes itwithout laying a small wax candle at his feet.  Neither do they approachthe Rayhoon and Mayhoon without this mark of respect.Some time after this, one of the chiefs who had submitted took up hisquarters at Bassein; and his little daughter, about eight or nine yearsold, was very fond of coming to see me, as I generally made her littlepresents.  She became very much attached to me, but she never appearedwithout a little wax candle, which she dropped at my feet before shethrew herself into my lap.In the present instance, the chief first made his appearance, and havingcome within a few feet, sat down as a _mark of respect_.  He wasfollowed by six more, who each carried about two pounds of wax candles,tastefully arranged in a sort of filigree work of coloured papers.After these came about fifty men, carrying large baskets full ofvegetables and fruit, which they poured out on the floor before us, andthen walked away and squatted at a distance.  A few words of ceremonywere then exchanged, and the friendship cemented over a bottle of brandyand some wine; which, notwithstanding the use of spirituous liquors isagainst their religion, and forbidden by the government, they did notobject to.  Before he left I made him a present in return, and he wentaway delighted with the gift.  Several more of the minor chiefsafterwards came in, and the same formalities were gone through; butthere were three of the most important who would not make theirappearance; one, the chief of Naputah, the town which we had passed,which did not fire at us from the stockades, and two others down atanother large arm of the river, who had many men detained for theservice of the army if required, and who were still at open defiance.All these three were gold chatta chiefs, that is, permitted to have agold umbrella carried over their heads when they appeared in public.After waiting a certain time for these people to send in theirsubmission, we sent word down to the chief of Naputah, that we shouldvisit him the next day, threatening him with the consequences of notcomplying with our request.  Accordingly we weighed in the Larne, anddropped down the river till we were abreast of the town and stockade,which was about thirty miles distant from Bassein.  Our broadside wasready; but as we were about to fire, we perceived that boats weremanning, and in about five minutes the chief of Naputah, in his ownwar-boat, accompanied by about twelve others, and a great many canoes,pulled off from the shore and came alongside.  He made his submission,with the usual accompaniments, and we were soon very good friends.  Wegave him a beautiful little brass gun, which ornamented our poop, and hewent away very well pleased.  We here had an opportunity of witnessingthe dexterity with which they handle their boats.  They really appearedto be alive, they darted through the water with such rapidity.  Many ofthe Burmahs remained on board, examining every part of the vessel andher equipment; and soon they were on the best of terms with the seamenand the few troops which I had on board to assist us, for we were veryshort manned.  We had gained intelligence that there were some guns sunkin a creek, about three miles from Bassein, and we had despatched a boatto look for them, having the assurance of a chief who was at Basseinthat the people were peaceable and well-disposed.  By some mistake, theboat went up the wrong creek, and pulled many miles into the country,without finding the spot pointed out by marks given.  At night they wereat the mercy of the Burmahs, who came to them to know what theyrequired.  The Burmahs told them that they had mistaken the creek, butwere very kind to them, giving them a good supper, and passing the nightamong them, playing their marionettes.  The next day they showed themtheir way, and when they came to the guns, the Burmahs dived, and maderopes fast, and brought them up for them, sending a message that theywould come and see the _Great Water-dog_ (meaning me) the next day.We remained two days at anchor, off the town of Naputah, waiting forthis boat, as it was our intention to go down the river, and attack thetwo other gold chatta chiefs, if they did not send in their submission.On the second day the chief came on board to ask us if we would attend aNautch which he gave that evening in compliment to us; but requestedthat we would not bring all our people, as it would frighten his own.Although it was not pleasant to trust ourselves on shore in the night,in the midst of so large a force, yet, anxious to make friends with him,we thought it advisable to accept the invitation in the manner hedesired.  I replied, "that I would only bring on shore a few officers,and my usual attendants of six marines without arms."  At eight o'clocksome of the officers and I went on shore: it was quite dark, but wefound the chief at the landing-place ready to receive us.  The marineshad their bayonets, and the officers had pistols concealed in case oftreachery, and the first lieutenant kept a good look out, with thebroadside of the ship all ready at the first flash of a pistol, butthese precautions were unnecessary; the chief took me by the hand andled me up to his house, in front of which had been erected a sort ofcovered circus, brilliantly lighted up with oil in cocoa-nut shells, andround which were squatted several hundred Burmahs.  He took us all tothe raised verandah of the house, which was fitted up for the ceremony,where we found his wife, and all his attendants, but not his daughter,who was said to be very handsome.  As soon as we had taken our seats theNautch commenced.  About twenty men struck up a very barbarous kind ofmusic, in which the bells and drums made the most noise.  After a fewminutes of discordant sound, the play began.  The actors were in a sortof costume, and appeared quite at home in their parts.  The storyconsisted in the attempts of a young prince to obtain the hand of ayoung princess; and the dialogue was constantly interrupted by an actorwho appeared to be a looker-on, but who made his remarks upon whatpassed, so as to excite bursts of laughter from the audience.  He wasthe Jack Pudding, or wit of the piece, and several of his jokes were notvery delicate.  At all events, he was the Liston of the company, for henever spoke nor moved without creating a laugh.  The play ended verycuriously; after the prince had gained the princess, they had aprocession, in which they made an imitation of a ship, out of complimentto us; and then built a little house on the stage with singularrapidity, to the door of which they conducted the youthful couple,closed it, and then the play was over.  In the meantime _pickled tea_(which is a great compliment and excessively nasty) was handed round tous, and we all partook of it, taking it out with our fingers; but wecould not swallow it, so it remained like a quid of tobacco in ourcheeks until we had an opportunity of getting rid of it.The purser had had the foresight to put a couple of bottles of wine, andone of brandy, in the pockets of the marines, which were now produced,while the band continued to play, and wrestling was introduced.  Weasked the chief to join us, but he refused; he handed down a sort ofpicture, in which was represented the white elephant, pagodas, etcetera,and told us that he was not only the war chief, but the head of thereligion at Naputah, and that it would not be right that he should beseen by his people transgressing the laws.  In the meantime hisdaughter, who did not come out to us, was very anxious to know what sortof people we were, and she sent for one to be brought in to her.  Myclerk was the favoured party.  She examined him very closely, pulled hisdress about, made him bare his legs, to see how white they were, andthen dismissed him.  The clerk reported her as very handsome, and quiteas white as he was; splendidly dressed; and with an air of command,which showed that she was aware of her importance.We staid about two hours longer, and then we rose to go away.  The chiefwalked with us down to the boats, and we were not sorry to findourselves on board again; for the population was much more numerous thanwe had imagined, and had any treachery been attempted, we must havefallen a sacrifice.CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.EXPEDITION TO BASSEIN CONTINUED.                                                              May, 1836.Although on friendly terms with the chief of Naputah, he was a person ofsuch weight in that part of the country, that it was advisable, ifpossible, to identify him with us, so that he should never again falloff, and oppose us, in the contingency of a reverse, on the Irrawaddy.The next day we sent for him, informing him that it was to make him apresent in return for his civility the day before.  But before we handedthe present to him, we stated our intention of dropping down the riverto reduce the two gold chatta chiefs who still held out; and that, as wedid not exactly know where their towns were situated, we wished for someof his people to go with me.  To this first proposition, after somehesitation, he consented.  We then pointed out that our men were notaccustomed to work in the sun, and were often ill; that, as we were nowfriends, we wished him to allow me some of his boats to assist the shipin the river.  To this also he consented.  In fine, we brought forwardour last proposition, which was, that he should supply us with six oreight war-boats, well manned, and that we would pay the men and officersat the same rate per day as we paid our own men; stating the sum wewould give, and that, if he was really sincere in his friendship andgoodwill, we expected not to be refused.  Now, among the Burmahs whowere with him, there were many whose relations were detained to join thearmy; a consultation ensued; the chief was pressed by his own people,and, at last, gave his consent.  We then presented him with the piece ofplate, upon which his eyes had constantly been turned, and he went away,promising us that the men and boats should be alongside by daylight thenext morning.This chief adhered to his promise, and we weighed anchor the next day,and made sail down with the war-boats, and three or fourdespatch-canoes, pulled by four or five men.  These little canoes, whenput to their speed, dashed through the water at such a rate, that theythrew off from each bow one continued little fan-shaped _jet-d'eau_,which had a very beautiful appearance, the sunbeams forming them intorainbows.  As for our Burmah force, they were at one time pullingagainst the vessel sailing; at others, hanging on, and the peopleclimbing about the rigging, and ascending the masthead of the vessel;but they soon all congregated to the stand of muskets, for that was thegreat object of attraction.  In the afternoon we had ball practice withthe small arms; and the Burmahs were, much to their delight, permittedto fire.  It is surprising how exact they were in their aims,considering the little practice they must have had.  Bad as all themuskets are which are served out to the ships of war, I really believethat there was not a Burmah who would not have laid down every thing hepossessed, except his life, to have obtained one.  One of them, when hewas permitted to take a musket, looked proudly round, and said, with asmile of joy, "Now I'm a man!"The next day we arrived at the branch of the river where one of thechiefs held out.  At daylight our own boats were manned, and with theBurmah boats ranged in line, made an imposing appearance, which was verynecessary, for at that time we were so short-handed, that we could notsend away more than forty men--a force so small, that, had the Burmahsopposed to us seen it advance, they would probably have tried theirstrength with us.  As it was, we pulled into the stockaded town in aline, the despatch-boats flying across us backwards and forwards likeporpoises before the bows of a ship running down the trades: not thatthey had any messages to carry, but merely to show their own dexterity.When we had advanced to within a quarter of a mile, a boat came out andcommunicated with one of the despatch-boats, saying that the Burmahswould not fight if we did not attack them, and that they would deliverup the men detained, and their chief as a prisoner.  We agreed to theseterms, landed, took possession of the chief with his gold chatta,correspondence with Bundoolah, etcetera, and took him on board.  On thisoccasion, we would not trust the Burmahs employed with muskets; it wastoo soon; they had only their own swords and spears.The chief was a fine tall man with a long beard.  Like all Burmahs, hetook his loss of liberty very composedly, sitting down between the gunswith his attendants, and only expressing his indignation at thetreachery of his own people.  We were very anxious to know what hadbecome of the guns of the dismantled stockade, which were said to be inhis possession, but he positively denied it, saying that they had beendespatched in boats across to the Irrawaddy.  Whether this were true ornot, it was impossible to say; but, at all events, it was necessary tomake some further attempts to obtain them, so we told him, that if hedid not inform us where the guns were, by the next morning his headwould be taken off his shoulders.  At this pleasant intelligence heopened his betel-bag and renewed his quid.  The next day he was summonedforth to account for the said guns, and again protested that they hadbeen sent to Donabue, which I really believe was false, as they were nottaken out of the stockade until after Donabue was in the possession ofSir A.  Campbell: it was therefore judged proper to appear to proceed toextremities; and this time it was done with more form.  A file ofmarines was marched aft with their muskets, and the sergeant appearedwith his drawn sword.  Sand was strewed on the deck in front of themarines; and he was led there and ordered to kneel down, so that hishead, if cut off, would fall where the sand was strewn.  He was againasked if he would tell where the guns were concealed, and again statedthat they were at Donabue; upon which he was desired to prepare fordeath.  He called one of his attendants and gave him his silverbetel-box, saying, "Take this to my wife,--when she sees it she willknow all."  I watched him very closely; his countenance was composed,but, as he bent forward over the sand, the muscles of his arms andshoulders quivered.  However, as it is not the custom to cut offpeople's heads on the quarter-deck of his Majesty's ships, we verymagnanimously reprieved him, and he was afterwards sent a prisoner toCalcutta.  But that he had the guns, we discovered afterwards, whichadds to his merit.Having succeeded in this attempt, we made sail for the stockade of theother chief, and arrived there that evening.  As he was supposed to begreater in force than the other, we decided upon an attack in the dark,when he would not be able to distinguish of what our force was composed;and this time we gave muskets to our Burmah comrades.  The attack wassuccessful, we obtained possession, and the chief fled, but our Burmahspursued him nearly two miles, made him prisoner, and brought him aboard.As he immediately tendered his submission, which the other would notdo, he was released the next day.We had done all our work, and having employed the Burmahs for a few daysmore in destroying the stockades at the entrance of the river, they werepaid and discharged from his Majesty's service.  They would not,however, quit us; but, so long as we remained in the river theycontinued to hang on to the ship, and discovered three guns which hadbeen sunk, which they weighed and brought on board.I have entered into this short narrative, as it will give some idea ofthe character of these people.  The government is despotic, cruel, andtreacherous, but the people are neither cruel nor treacherous: on thecontrary, I think they would make most excellent and faithful soldiers;and it is singular to find, surrounded by natives who have not theslightest energy of mind or body, a people so active, so laborious, andso enterprising as the Burmahs.  The English seamen are particularlypartial to them, and declared they were "the best set of chaps they hadever fallen in with."  They admitted the Burmahs to their messes, andwere sworn friends.  I forgot to say, that when the chiefs sent in theirsubmissions, at first, among other presents, they sent _slaves_, usuallyfemales, which was rather awkward.  But not wishing to affront them, Ibegged that the slaves sent might be children, and not grown up, as wehad no accommodation for them.  The consequence was, that I had quite ayoung family when I left the river, which I distributed at Rangoon andthe presidencies on my return.  For if they were only bond-slaves, whichI suppose they were, it was a kindness to have them educated and takencare _of_.  We lost one little fellow, that was a great favourite withthe men; he was about three years old, and could speak English.  He hadbeen christened by the sailors Billy Bamboo, and was quite as amusing asthe monkey.  The poor little fellow died very suddenly, and was muchregretted by all on board.I certainly do think that we may eventually find the Burmahs to be themost powerful enemy that we shall have to contend with in India; and, atthe same time, I cannot help giving my opinion as to the ridiculous fearwe entertain of the Russians ever interfering with us in that quarter.That the extension of the Russian empire has been a favourite objectthrough many of her dynasties, is true: but it is so no longer: theyhave discovered that already their empire is too extensive; and hardly ayear passes but they have outbreaks and insurrections to quell inquarters so remote that they are scarcely heard of here.  That Russiamight _possibly_ lead an army through our Indian possessions, I admit;but that she never could hold them if she did do so, is equally certain;the conquest would be useless to her, after having been obtained at anenormous sacrifice.  The fact is, the Russians (with the exception ofthe Emperor Paul) never had any intention of the kind, and _never willattempt it_: but they have discovered how very alive we are to thepossibility, and how very jealous and anxious we are on the subject, andit is possible that they have made demonstrations in that direction toalarm us; but I think myself, that the great object of Russia in theseadvances has been to force a channel for trade, which in her presentsituation she is to the south of her extensive empire nearly deprivedof.  Notwithstanding the outcry which has so often been raised againstthe Russian empire, it has always appeared to me that _our natural ally_is Russia; as for an alliance with France it is morally impossible thattwo rival nations like us can continue very long at peace; our interestsare separate and conflicting, and our jealousy but sleeps for themoment.  We have been at peace with France many years, and have not yetsucceeded in making a satisfactory commercial treaty with her; neitherwill any of the other Continental powers permit our manufactures toenter, with the exception of Russia, who not only takes them, butreturns to us what is most valuable for our marine.Why, then, this outcry against the ambition of Russia? nothing buttirades against _Russian_ ambition.  Does France show no ambition?  DoesAmerica show no ambition?  Have we no ambition ourselves?  Why thisconstant suspicion and doubt against a power whose interest it is to beclosely allied to us, and who can always prove a valuable aid in case ofemergency?--simply because Russia wishes to have an opening to the BlackSea.  And this is very natural; her northern ports are closed ninemonths in the year, and therefore her navy and mercantile marine arealmost useless.  She has no outlet, no means of raising either.  Doesshe, then, ask too much?  Is a great empire like Russia to be blockedup, her commerce and navy crippled, for the want of an outlet?  She doesrequire the opening of the Black Sea; it is all that she requires.  Shenever will remain quiet until she obtains it; and obtain it sooner orlater she certainly will; and in my opinion she is perfectly justifiedin her attempts.  What would be the consequence if she succeeded?--that,if we were wise enough to continue on terms of amity with Russia, whohas invariably extended the hand of friendship to us, and has I believenever failed in her treaties, we should have a balance of power to usvery important.  Whose navies shall we in future have to contendagainst?--those of France and America; for it is certain that wheneverwe go to war with France, America will back her, and their navies willbe united.  At present, the navy of America is not very large, but itcan soon be made so; and we should not be sorry to have the navy ofRussia on our side, to balance against the two which will always beopposed to us.  It is, therefore, our interest to _assist_ Russia in theobject she has in view, and to keep up a firm alliance with her.  It isthe interest of France to excite jealousies between Russia and thiscountry; and her emissaries have been but too successful, at the verytime that France has, contrary to all treaty, and exclaiming against_Russian_ ambition, seized upon Algiers, and is now playing her game, soas if possible to command the whole of the Mediterranean.  The verystrides which France has made in that quarter should point out to us thepropriety of opening the Black Sea for Russia, so as to restore thebalance of power in that future site of contention.  I repeat that weare blind in every way to our own interests, in not uniting ourselvesfirmly by an alliance, offensive and defensive, with Russia; and that byso doing, we should be the greatest gainers; for with France we mustnever expect more than a _hollow truce_, concealing for the time herjealousy and thirst for revenge,--a truce during which her secretefforts to undermine us, will be still carried on as indefatigably asever, and
