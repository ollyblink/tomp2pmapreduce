r his friend Gratte-les-rues, will have no hesitation inhandling. Indeed, from significant symptoms, I conclude that theirfingers are itching for some such practice.""They are indeed two horrid-looking blackguards!" said Bagsby dolefully."I wish I had pluck enough to be hanged: after all, it could not be muchworse than marriage. And yet I don't know. There may be some means ofgetting a divorce, or she may drink herself to death, for, between youand me, she seems awfully addicted to the use of ardent spirits.""Fie! Mr Bagsby; how can you talk so of your bride upon the wedding-day!Be quick! get into those trousers, and never mind the fit. It may bedangerous to keep them waiting long; and, under present circumstances,it would be prudent to abstain from trying the temper of the lady tooseverely.""I never thought to be married this way!" sighed Bagsby, putting on themilitary coat, which, being stiff with embroidery, and twice too big forhim, stuck out like an enormous cuirass. "If my poor old mother couldsee me now, getting into the cast-off clothes of some outlandishFrenchman--""She would admire you exceedingly, I am sure. Do you know, you lookquite warlike with these epaulets! Come now--on with the sash, takeanother thimbleful of brandy, and then to the altar like a man!""I daresay you mean well, Mr Dunshunner; but I have listened to morepleasant conversation. I say--what is to prevent my getting up thechimney?""Mere madness! The moment you are missed they will fire up it. Believeme, you have not a chance of escape; so the sooner you resign yourselfto your inevitable destiny the better."Here a loud knocking was heard at the door."Citizen Minister of Marine, art thou ready?" cried the voice ofPomme-de-terre. "Thy bride is waiting for thee, the altar is decked,and Pere Potard in his robes of office!""Come, then," said I, seizing Bagsby by the arm. "Take courage, man! Inten minutes it will all be over."Our colleagues had not been idle in the interim. At one end of the hallthey had built up an extempore altar covered with a carpet, behind whichstood Jupiter Potard, arrayed in a royal mantle of crimson velvet, whichvery possibly in former days might have decorated the shoulders ofNapoleon. Indeed the imperial eagle was worked upon it in gold, and ithad been abstracted from one of the numerous repositories of the palace.Jupiter, with his long beard and fine sloping forehead, looked theperfect image of a pontiff, and might have been appropriately drawn as aprincipal figure in a picture of the marriage of Heliogabalus.Gratte-les-rues and Pomme-de-terre, being of bellicose temperament, hadencased themselves in suits of armour, and stood, like two champions ofantiquity, on each side of the venerable prelate. Destripes, who hadaccepted the office of temporary father to Demoiselle Corbeille,appeared as a patriot of the Reign of Terror. His brawny chest was bare;his shirt sleeves rolled up to the shoulder; and in his belt was stuckthe axe, a fitting emblem alike of his principles and his profession.At his right hand stood the bride, bedizened with brocade and finery.From what antiquated lumber-chest they had fished out her apparel, itwould be utterly in vain to inquire. One thing was clear, that theformer occupant of the robes had been decidedly inferior in girth tothe blooming poissarde, since it was now necessary to fasten themacross the bosom by a curious network of tape. I am afraid I have doneinjustice to this lady, for really, on the present occasion, she didnot look superlatively hideous. She was a woman of about forty-five,strong-built, with an immense development of foot and ancle, and arms ofmasculine proportion. Yet she had a pair of decidedly fine black eyes,betokening perhaps little of maiden modesty, but flashing with love andtriumph; a _nez retrousse_, which, but for its perpetual redness, mighthave given a piquant expression to her countenance; a large mouth, and aset of prodigious teeth, which, to say the truth, were enough to justifythe apprehensions of the bridegroom."Silence!" cried Jupiter Potard as we entered; "let the present augustsolemnity be conducted as befits the sovereignty of the people! CitizenSaigne-du-nez, advance!"Saigne-du-nez was clad in a black frock, I suppose to represent anotary. He came forward:--"In the name of the French nation, one and indivisible, I demand thecelebration of the nuptials of Citizen Hutton Bagsby, adopted child ofFrance, and Provisional Minister of her Marine in the department of theTuileries, and of Citoyenne Cephyse Corbeille, poissarde, and daughterof the people.""Is there any one here to gainsay the marriage?" asked Jupiter.There was no reply."Then, in the name of the French nation, I decree that the ceremonyshall proceed. Citizen Minister of Marine, are you willing to take thiswoman as your lawful wife?"A cold sweat stood upon the brow of Bagsby, his knees knocked together,and he leaned the whole weight of his body upon my arm, as I interpretedto him the demand of Jupiter."Say anything you like," muttered he; "it will all come to the samething at last!""The citizen consents, most venerable President.""Then nothing remains but to put the same question to the citoyenne,"said Potard. "Who appears as the father of the bride?""_Chute de la Bastille!_ that do I," cried Destripes."Citizen Destripes, do you of your own free will and accord--"Here a thundering rap was heard at the door."What is that?" cried Destripes, starting back. "Some one has passed thebarricade!""In the name of the Provisional Government!" cried a loud voice. Thedoor was flung open, and to my inexpressible joy, I beheld the Count ofMonte-Christo, backed by a large detachment of the National Guard."Treason! treachery!" shouted Destripes. "Ah, villain, thou hastneglected thy post!" and he fetched a tremendous blow with his axe atthe head of Gratte-les-rues. It was fortunate for that chief that hishelmet was of excellent temper, otherwise he must have been cloven tothe chin. As it was, he staggered backwards and fell.The National Guard immediately presented their muskets."I have the honour to inform the citizens," said Monte-Christo, "that Ihave imperative orders to fire if the slightest resistance is made.Monsieur, therefore, will have the goodness immediately to lay down thataxe."Destripes glared on him for a moment, as though he meditated a rush, butthe steady attitude of the National Guard involuntarily subdued him."This is freedom!" he exclaimed, flinging away his weapon. "This is whatwe fought for at the barricades! Always deceived--always sold by thearistocrats! But the day may come when I shall hold a tight reckoningwith thee, my master, or I am not the nephew of the citizen Samson!""Pray, may I ask the meaning of this extraordinary scene?" saidMonte-Christo, gazing in astonishment at the motley group before him."Is it the intention of the gentlemen to institute a Crusade, or have welighted by chance upon an assemblage of the chivalry of Malta?""Neither," I replied. "The fact is, that just as you came in we wereengaged in celebrating a republican marriage.""Far be it from me to interfere with domestic or connubialarrangements!" replied the polite Monte-Christo. "Let the marriage goon, by all means; I shall be delighted to witness it, and we can proceedto business thereafter.""You will see no marriage here, I can tell you!" cried Bagsby, who atthe first symptom of relief had taken shelter under the shadow of theMarquis. "I put myself under your protection; and, by Jove, if you don'thelp me, I shall immediately complain to Lord Normanby!""What is this?" cried Monte-Christo. "Do I see Monsieur Bagsby in ageneral's uniform? Why, my good sir, you have become a naturalisedFrenchman indeed! The nation has a claim upon you.""The nation will find it very difficult to get it settled then!" saidBagsby. "But I want to get out. I say, can't I get away?""Certainly. There is nothing to prevent you. But I am rather curious tohear about this marriage.""Why," said I, "the truth is, my dear Marquis, that the subject israther a delicate one for our friend. He has just been officiating inthe capacity of bridegroom.""You amaze me!" said Monte-Christo; "and which, may I ask, is the fairlady?"Here Demoiselle Cephyse came forward."Citizen officer," she said, "I want my husband!""You hear, Monsieur Bagsby?" said Monte-Christo, in intense enjoyment ofthe scene. "The lady says she has a claim upon you.""It's all a lie!" shouted Bagsby. "I've got nothing to say to the woman.I hate and abhor her!""_Monstre!_" shrieked the poissarde, judging of Bagsby's ungallantrepudiation rather from his gestures than his words. And she sprangtowards him with the extended talons of a tigress. Bagsby, however, wasthis time too nimble for her, and took refuge behind the ranks of theNational Guard, who were literally in convulsions of laughter."I will have thee, though, _polisson_!" cried the exasperated bride. "Iwill have thee, though I were to follow thee to the end of the world!Thou hast consented to be my husband, little _tisserand_, and I neverwill give thee up.""Keep her off! good, dear soldiers," cried Bagsby: "pray, keep her off!I shall be murdered and torn to pieces if she gets hold of me! Oh, MrDunshunner! do tell them to protect me with their bayonets.""Be under no alarm, Mr Bagsby," said Monte-Christo; "you are now underthe protection of the National Guard. But to business. Which of thecitizens assembled is spokesman here?""I am the president!" hiccupped Jupiter Potard, who, throughout themorning, had been unremitting in his attentions to the bottle."Then, you will understand that, by orders of the ProvisionalGovernment, all must evacuate the palace within a quarter of an hour.""Louis Philippe had seventeen years of it," replied Jupiter Potard. "Iwon't abdicate a minute sooner!""And I," said Pomme-de-terre, "expect a handsome pension for my pains.""Or at least," said Saigne-du-nez, "we must have permission to gut theinterior.""You have done quite enough mischief already," said Monte-Christo; "soprepare to move. My orders are quite peremptory, and I shall executethem to the letter!""Come along, then, citizens!" cried Destripes. "I always knew what wouldcome of it, if these rascally _bourgeoisie_ got the upper hand of theworkmen. They are all black aristocrats in their hearts. But, by thehead of Robespierre, thou shalt find that thy government is not settledyet, and there shall be more blood before we let them trample down therights of the people!"So saying, the democratic butcher strode from the apartment, followed bythe rest of the Provisional Government and their adherents, eachretaining the garb which he had chosen to wear in honour of the nuptialsof Bagsby. The poissarde lingered for a moment, eyeing her faithlessbetrothed as he stood in the midst of the Guard, like a lioness robbedof her cub; and then, with a cry of wrath, and a gesture of menace, sherushed after her companions."Thank Heaven!" cried Bagsby, dropping on his knees, "the bitterest hourof my whole existence is over!"CHAPTER VII.ADIEU, SWEET FRANCE!"And so you received the message from M. Albert?" said I toMonte-Christo, as we walked together to the Hotel de Ville."I did; and to say the truth, I was rather apprehensive about you.Revolutions are all very well; but it is a frightful thing when thedregs of the population get the upper hand.""I am glad to hear you acknowledge so much. For my part, Marquis, havingseen one revolution, I never wish to witness another.""We could not possibly avoid it," said Monte-Christo. "It was a merequestion of time. No one doubts that a revolutionary spirit may becarried too far.""Can't you contrive to write it down?" said I."Unfortunately, the majority of gentlemen with whom you have lately beenassociating, are not strongly addicted to letters. I question whether M.Destripes has even read La Tour de Nesle.""If he had," said I, "it must have tended very greatly to his moralimprovement. But how is it with the Provisional Government?""Faith, I must own they are rather in a critical position. Had it notbeen for Lamartine--who, I must confess, is a noble fellow, and a man ofundaunted courage--they would have been torn to pieces long ago.Hitherto they have managed tolerably by means of the National Guard; butthe atmosphere is charged with thunder. Here we are, however, at theHotel de Ville."Not the least curious of the revolutionary scenes of Paris was theaspect of the seat of government. At the moment I reached it, manythousands of the lower orders were assembled in front, and one of theProvisional Government, I believe Louis Blanc, was haranguing them froma window. Immense crowds were likewise gathered round the entrance.These consisted of the deputations, who were doing their very best toexhaust the physical energies, and distract the mental powers, of themen who had undertaken the perilous task of government.Under conduct of my friend, I made my way to the room where themysterious _ouvrier_ was performing his part of the onerous duty. Hegreeted me with a brief nod and a grim smile, but did not pretermit hispaternal functions.The body which occupied his attention at this crisis of thecommonwealth, was a musical deputation, which craved sweet counselregarding some matter of crotchets or of bars. It is not the first timethat music has been heard in the midst of stirring events. Nero took afancy to fiddle when Rome was blazing around him.I could not but admire the gravity with which Albert listened to thesomewhat elaborate address, and the dexterity with which he contrived toblend the subjects of pipes and patriotism."Citizens!" he said, "the Provisional Government are deeply impressedwith the importance of the views which you advocate. Republicaninstitutions cannot hope to exist without music, for to the sound ofmusic even the spheres themselves revolve in the mighty and illimitableexpanse of ether."At this crisis your suggestions become doubly valuable. I have listenedto them with emotions which I would struggle in vain to express. Oh,that we may see the day when, with a glorious nation as an orchestra,the psalm of universal freedom may rise in a swell of triumphantjubilee!"And it will come! Rely upon us. Return to your homes. Cherishfraternity and music. Meantime we shall work without intermission foryour sake. Harmony is our sole object: believe me that, in reconstitutedFrance, there shall be nothing but perfect harmony."The deputation withdrew in tears; and another entered to state certaingrievances touching the manufacture of steel beads. I need not say thatin this, as in several other instances, the _ouvrier_ comported himselflike an eminent member of the Society of Universal Knowledge."That's the last of them, praise be to Mumbo Jumbo!" said he, as therepresentatives of the shoe-blacks departed. "Faith, this is work hardenough to kill a horse. So, Mr Dunshunner! you have been getting up acounter-revolution at the Tuileries, I see. How are Monsieur Potard andall the rest of your colleagues?""I am afraid they are finally expelled from paradise," said I."Serve them right! a parcel of democratic scum. And what has become ofCitizen Bagsby?""I have sent him to my hotel. He was in reality very near becoming anactual child of France." And I told the story of the nuptials, at whichthe _ouvrier_ nearly split himself with laughter."And now, Mr Dunshunner," said he, "may I ask the nature of your plans?""These may depend a good deal upon your advice," said I."I never give advice," replied the _ouvrier_ with a nasal twitch."Sometimes it is rather dangerous. But tell me--what would you think ofthe state of the British government, if Earl Grey at a cabinet-councilwere to threaten to call in the mob, and if Lord Johnny Russellprevented him by clapping a pistol to his ear.""I should think very badly of it indeed," said I."Or if Incapability Wood should threaten, in the event of the populaceappearing, to produce from the Earl's pocket a surreptitious order onthe Treasury for something like twelve thousand pounds?""Worse still.""Well, then; I don't think you'll find _that_ sort of thing going on inLondon, at all events.""Have you any commands for the other side of the Channel?""Oh, then, you are determined to leave? Well, perhaps upon the whole itis your wisest plan. But do not you regret having evacuated theTuileries?""Indeed, I do not. Nevertheless, Monsieur Albert, it may yet be occupiedby one of my family.""_C'est bien possible._ You are a clever race. What began with aClovis, may well end with a Dunshunner."And so, with a cordial pressure of the hand, we parted."Monte-Christo," I said, as that very evening I bundled Bagsby into a_fiacre_ on our way to the railroad station--"Monte-Christo, my goodfellow, let me give you a slight piece of advice, which it would be wellif all of our craft and calling would keep in memory, 'THINK TWICEBEFORE YOU WRITE UP ANOTHER REVOLUTION.'"CAPTAIN PATON'S LAMENT.BY JOHN GIBSON LOCKHART.[_MAGA._ SEPTEMBER 1819.]                         1.       Touch once more a sober measure,         And let punch and tears be shed,       For a prince of good old fellows,         That, alack-a-day! is dead;       For a prince of worthy fellows,          And a pretty man also,       That has left the Saltmarket          In sorrow, grief, and woe.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         2.       His waistcoat, coat, and breeches,         Were all cut off the same web,       Of a beautiful snuff-colour,         Or a modest genty drab;       The blue stripe in his stocking         Round his neat slim leg did go,       And his ruffles of the cambric fine         They were whiter than the snow.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         3.       His hair was curled in order,         At the rising of the sun,       In comely rows and buckles smart         That about his ears did run;       And before there was a toupee         That some inches up did grow,       And behind there was a long queue         That did o'er his shoulders flow.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         4.       And whenever we forgathered,         He took off his wee three-cockit,       And he proffered you his snuff-box,         Which he drew from his side pocket,       And on Burdett or Buonaparte,         He would make a remark or so,       And then along the plainstones         Like a provost he would go.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         5.       In dirty days he picked well         His footsteps with his rattan,       Oh! you ne'er could see the least speck         On the shoes of Captain Paton;       And on entering the Coffee-room         About _two_, all men did know,       They would see him with his Courier         In the middle of the row.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         6.       Now and then upon a Sunday         He invited me to dine,       On a herring and a mutton-chop         Which his maid dressed very fine;       There was also a little Malmsey,         And a bottle of Bordeaux,       Which between me and the Captain         Passed nimbly to and fro.     Oh! I ne'er shall take pot-luck with Captain Paton no mo!                         7.       Or if a bowl was mentioned,         The Captain he would ring,       And bid Nelly run to the West-port.         And a stoup of water bring;       Then would he mix the genuine stuff,         As they made it long ago,       With limes that on his property         In Trinidad did grow.     Oh! we ne'er shall taste the like of Captain Paton's punch no mo!                         8.       And then all the time he would discourse         So sensible and courteous,       Perhaps talking of last sermon         He had heard from Dr Porteous,       Or some little bit of scandal         About Mrs so and so,       Which he scarce could credit, having heard         The _con_ but not the _pro_.     Oh! we ne'er shall hear the like of Captain Paton no mo!                         9.       Or when the candles were brought forth,         And the night was fairly setting in,       He would tell some fine old stories         About Minden-field or Dettingen--       How he fought with a French major,         And despatched him at a blow,       While his blood ran out like water         On the soft grass below.     Oh! we ne'er shall hear the like of Captain Paton no mo!                        10.       But at last the Captain sickened         And grew worse from day to day.       And all missed him in the Coffee-room         From which now he stayed away;       On Sabbaths, too, the Wee Kirk         Made a melancholy show,       All for wanting of the presence         Of our venerable beau.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                        11.       And in spite of all that Cleghorn         And Corkindale could do,       It was plain from twenty symptoms         That death was in his view;       So the Captain made his test'ment,         And submitted to his foe,       And we layed him by the Rams-horn Kirk--         'Tis the way we all must go.     Oh! we ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!                        12.       Join all in chorus, jolly boys,         And let punch and tears be shed,       For this prince of good old fellows,         That, alack-a-day! is dead;       For this prince of worthy fellows,         And a pretty man also,       That has left the Saltmarket         In sorrow, grief, and woe!     For it ne'er shall see the like of Captain Paton no mo!THE VILLAGE DOCTOR.BY THE LATE COUNTESS D'ARBOUVILLE.[_MAGA._ MAY 1849.]"What is that?" exclaimed several persons assembled in the dining-roomof the chateau of Burcy.The Countess of Moncar had just inherited, from a distant and slightlyregretted relation, an ancient chateau which she had never seen,although it was at barely fifteen leagues from her habitual summerresidence. One of the most elegant and admired women in Paris, Madame deMoncar was but moderately attached to the country. Quitting the capitalat the end of June, to return thither early in October, she usually tookwith her some of the companions of her winter gaieties, and a few youngmen, selected amongst her most assiduous partners. Madame de Moncar wasmarried to a man much older than herself, who did not always protect herby his presence. Without abusing the great liberty she enjoyed, she wasgracefully coquettish, elegantly frivolous, pleased with trifles--witha compliment, an amiable word, an hour's triumph--loving a ball forthe pleasure of adorning herself, fond of admiration, and notsorry to inspire love. When some grave old aunt ventured a sageremonstrance--"_Mon Dieu!_" she replied; "do let me laugh and takelife gaily. It is far less dangerous than to listen in solitude to thebeating of one's heart. For my part, I do not know if I even have aheart!" She spoke the truth, and really was uncertain upon that point.Desirous to remain so, she thought it prudent to leave herself no timefor reflection.One fine morning in September, the countess and her guests set out forthe unknown chateau, intending to pass the day there. A cross road,reputed practicable, was to reduce the journey to twelve leagues. Thecross road proved execrable: the travellers lost their way in theforest; a carriage broke down; in short, it was not till mid-day thatthe party, much fatigued, and but moderately gratified by thepicturesque beauties of the scenery, reached the chateau of Burcy, whoseaspect was scarcely such as to console them for the annoyances of thejourney. It was a large sombre building with dingy walls. In its front agarden, then out of cultivation, descended from terrace to terrace; forthe chateau, built upon the slope of a wooded hill, had no level groundin its vicinity. On all sides it was hemmed in by mountains, the treesupon which sprang up amidst rocks, and had a dark and gloomy foliagethat saddened the eyesight. Man's neglect added to the natural wilddisorder of the scene. Madame de Moncar stood motionless anddisconcerted upon the threshold of her newly-acquired mansion."This is very unlike a party of pleasure," said she; "I could weep atsight of this dismal abode. Nevertheless here are noble trees, loftyrocks, a roaring cataract; doubtless, there is a certain beauty in allthat; but it is of too grave an order for my humour," added she with asmile. "Let us go in and view the interior."The hungry guests, eager to see if the cook, who had been sent forwardupon the previous day, as an advanced guard, had safely arrived,willingly assented. Having obtained the agreeable certainty thatbreakfast would soon be upon the table, they rambled through thechateau. The old-fashioned furniture with tattered coverings, thearm-chairs with three legs, the tottering tables, the discordant soundsof a piano, which for a good score of years had not felt a finger,afforded abundant food for jest and merriment. Gaiety returned. Insteadof grumbling at the inconveniences of this uncomfortable mansion, itwas agreed to laugh at everything. Moreover, for these young andidle persons, the expedition was a sort of event, an almost perilouscampaign, whose originality appealed to the imagination. A faggotwas lighted beneath the wide chimney of the drawing-room; butclouds of smoke were the result, and the company took refuge in thepleasure-grounds. The aspect of the gardens was strange enough: thestone-benches were covered with moss; the walls of the terraces,crumbling in many places, left space between their ill-joined stones forthe growth of numerous wild plants, which sprung out erect and lofty, ortrailed with flexible grace towards the earth. The walks were overgrownand obliterated by grass; the parterres, reserved for garden-flowers,were invaded by wild ones, which grow wherever the heavens afford a dropof water and a ray of sun; the insipid bear-bine enveloped and stifledin its envious embrace the beauteous rose of Provence; the blackberrymingled its acrid fruits with the red clusters of the currant-bush;ferns, wild mint with its faint perfume, thistles with their thornycrowns, grew beside a few forgotten lilies. When the company entered theenclosure, numbers of the smaller animals, alarmed at the unaccustomedintrusion, darted into the long grass, and the startled birds flewchirping from branch to branch. Silence, for many years the undisturbedtenant of this peaceful spot, fled at the sound of human voices andof joyous laughter. The solitude was appreciated by none--none grewpensive under its influence; it was recklessly broken and profaned.The conversation ran upon the gay evenings of the past season, andwas interspersed with amiable allusions, expressive looks, covertcompliments, with all the thousand nothings, in short, resorted to bypersons desirous to please each other, but who have not yet acquiredthe right to be serious.The steward, after long search for a breakfast-bell along thedilapidated walls of the chateau, at last made up his mind to shoutfrom the steps that the meal was ready--the half-smile with whichhe accompanied the announcement, proving that, like his betters, heresigned himself for one day to a deviation from his habits of etiquetteand propriety. Soon a merry party surrounded the board. The gloom of thechateau, its desert site and uncheery aspect, were all forgotten; theconversation was general and well sustained; the health of the lady ofthe castle--the fairy whose presence converted the crazy old edificeinto an enchanted palace, was drunk by all present. Suddenly all eyeswere turned to the windows of the dining-room."What is that?" exclaimed several of the guests.A small carriage of green wicker-work, with great wheels as high as thebody of the vehicle, passed before the windows, and stopped at the door.It was drawn by a grey horse, short and punchy, whose eyes seemed indanger from the shafts, which, from their point of junction with thecarriage, sloped obliquely upwards. The hood of the little cabrioletwas brought forward, concealing its contents, with the exception of twoarms covered with the sleeves of a blue _blouse_, and of a whip whichfluttered about the ears of the grey horse."_Mon Dieu!_" exclaimed Madame de Moncar, "I forgot to tell you I wasobliged to invite the village doctor to breakfast. The old man wasformerly of some service to my uncle's family, and I have seen himonce or twice. Be not alarmed at the addition to our party: he is verytaciturn. After a few civil words, we may forget his presence; besides,I do not suppose he will remain very long."At this moment the dining-room door opened, and Dr Barnaby entered.He was a little old man, feeble and insignificant-looking, of calmand gentle countenance. His grey hairs were collected into a queue,according to a bygone fashion; a dash of powder whitened his temples,and extended to his furrowed brow. He wore a black coat, and steelbuckles to his breeches. Over one arm hung a riding-coat of browntaffety. In the opposite hand he carried his hat and a thick cane. Hiswhole appearance proved that he had taken unusual pains with his toilet;but his black stockings and coat were stained with mud, as if the poorold man had fallen into a ditch. He paused at the door, astonished atthe presence of so many persons. For an instant a tinge of embarrassmentappeared upon his face; but recovering himself, he silently saluted thecompany. The strange manner of his entrance gave the guests a violentinclination to laugh, which they repressed more or less successfully.Madame de Moncar alone, in her character of mistress of the house, andincapable of failing in politeness, perfectly preserved her gravity."Dear me, doctor! have you had an overturn?" was her first inquiry.Before replying, Dr Barnaby glanced at all these young people in themidst of whom he found himself, and, simple and artless though hisphysiognomy was, he could not but guess the cause of their hilarity.He replied quietly:"I have not been overturned. A poor carter fell under the wheels of hisvehicle; I was passing, and I helped him up." And the doctor tookpossession of a chair left vacant for him at the table. Unfolding hisnapkin, he passed a corner through the button-hole of his coat, andspread out the rest over his waistcoat and knees. At these preparations,smiles hovered upon the lips of many of the guests, and a whisper or twobroke the silence; but this time the doctor did not raise his eyes.Perhaps he observed nothing."Is there much sickness in the village?" inquired Madame de Moncar,whilst they were helping the new-comer."Yes, madam, a good deal.""This is an unhealthy neighbourhood?""No, madam.""But the sickness. What causes it?""The heat of the sun in harvest time and the cold and wet of winter."One of the guests, affecting great gravity, joined in the conversation."So that in this healthy district, sir, people are ill all the yearround?"The doctor raised his little grey eyes to the speaker's face, looked athim, hesitated, and seemed either to check or to seek a reply. Madame deMoncar kindly came to his relief."I know," she said, "that you are here the guardian genius of all whosuffer.""Oh, you are too good," replied the old man, apparently much engrossedwith the slice of pasty upon his plate. Then the gay party left DrBarnaby to himself, and the conversation flowed in its previous channel.If any notice was taken of the peaceable old man, it was in the form ofsome slight sarcasm, which, mingled with other discourse, would pass,it was thought, unperceived by its object. Not that these young men andwomen were generally otherwise than polite and kind-hearted; but uponthat day the journey, the breakfast, the merriment and slight excitementthat had attended all the events of the morning, had brought on a sortof heedless gaiety and communicative mockery, which rendered thempitiless to the victim whom chance had thrown in their way. The doctorcontinued quietly to eat, without looking up, or uttering a word, orseeming to hear one; they voted him deaf and dumb, and he was norestraint upon the conversation.When the guests rose from table, Dr Barnaby took a step or twobackwards, and allowed each man to select the lady he wished to takeinto the drawing-room. One of Madame de Moncar's friends remainingwithout a cavalier, the village doctor timidly advanced, and offeredher his hand--not his arm. His fingers scarcely touched hers as heproceeded, his body slightly bent in sign of respect, with measuredsteps towards the drawing-room. Fresh smiles greeted his entrance, butnot a cloud appeared upon the placid countenance of the old man, who wasnow declared blind, as well as deaf and dumb. Quitting his companion,Dr Barnaby selected the smallest, humblest-looking chair in the room,placed it in a corner, at some distance from everybody else, put hisstick between his knees, crossed his hands upon the knob, and rested hischin upon his hands. In this meditative attitude he remained silent, andfrom time to time his eyes closed, as if a gentle slumber, which heneither invoked nor repelled, were stealing over him."Madame de Moncar!" cried one of the guests, "I presume it is not yourintention to inhabit this ruin in a desert?""Certainly I have no such project. But here are lofty trees and wildwoods. M. de Moncar may very likely be tempted to pass a few weeks herein the shooting season.""In that case you must pull down and rebuild; clear, alter, andimprove!""Let us make a plan!" cried the young countess. "Let us mark out thefuture garden of my domains."It was decreed that this party of pleasure should be unsuccessful. Atthat moment a heavy cloud burst, and a close fine rain began to fall.Impossible to leave the house."How very vexatious!" cried Madame de Moncar. "What shall we do withourselves? The horses require several hours' rest. It will evidentlybe a wet afternoon. For a week to come, the grass, which overgrowseverything, will not be dry enough to walk upon; all the strings of thepiano are broken; there is not a book within ten leagues. This room iswretchedly dismal. What can we do with ourselves?"The party, lately so joyous, was gradually losing its gaiety. The blithelaugh and arch whisper were succeeded by dull silence. The guestssauntered to the windows and examined the sky, but the sky remaineddark and cloud-laden. Their hopes of a walk were completely blighted.They established themselves as comfortably as they could upon the oldchairs and settees, and tried to revive the conversation; but there arethoughts which, like flowers, require a little sun, and which will notflourish under a bleak sky. All these young heads appeared to droop,oppressed by the storm, like the poplars in the garden, which bowedtheir tops at the will of the wind. A tedious hour dragged by.The lady of the castle, a little disheartened by the failure of herparty of pleasure, leaned languidly upon a window-sill, and gazedvaguely at the prospect without."There," said she--"yonder, upon the hill, is a white cottage that mustcome down: it hides the view.""The white cottage!" cried the doctor. For upwards of an hour Dr Barnabyhad been mute and motionless upon his chair. Mirth and weariness, sunand rain, had succeeded each other without eliciting a syllable from hislips. His presence was forgotten by everybody: every eye turned quicklyupon him when he uttered these three words--"The white cottage!""What interest do you take in it, doctor?" asked the countess."_Mon Dieu, madame!_ Pray forget that I spoke. The cottage will comedown, undoubtedly, since such is your good pleasure.""But why should you regret the old shed?""I--_Mon Dieu!_ it was inhabited by persons I loved--and--""And they think of returning to it, doctor?""They are long since dead, madam; they died when I was young!" And theold man gazed mournfully at the white cottage, which rose amongst thetrees upon the hill-side, like a daisy in a green field. There was abrief silence."Madam," said one of the guests in a low voice to Madame de Moncar,"there is mystery here. Observe the melancholy of our Esculapius. Somepathetic drama has been enacted in yonder house; a tale of love,perhaps. Ask the doctor to tell it us.""Yes, yes!" was murmured on all sides, "a tale, a story! And should itprove of little interest, at any rate the narrator will divert us.""Not so, gentlemen," replied Madame de Moncar, in the same suppressedvoice. "If I ask Dr Barnaby to tell us the history of the white cottage,it is on the express condition that no one laughs." All having promisedto be serious and well-behaved, Madame de Moncar approached the oldman. "Doctor," said she, seating herself beside him, "that house, Iplainly see, is connected with some reminiscence of former days, storedpreciously in your memory. Will you tell it us? I should be grieved tocause you a regret which it is in my power to spare you; the house shallremain, if you tell me why you love it."Dr Barnaby seemed surprised, and remained silent. The countess drewstill nearer to him. "Dear doctor!" said she, "see what wretchedweather; how dreary everything looks. You are the senior of us all;tell us a tale. Make us forget rain, and fog, and cold."Dr Barnaby looked at the countess with great astonishment."There is no tale," he said. "What occurred in the cottage is verysimple, and has no interest but for me, who loved the young people;strangers would not call it a tale. And I am unaccustomed to speakbefore many listeners. Besides, what I should tell you is sad, and youcame to amuse yourselves." And again the doctor rested his chin upon hisstick."Dear doctor," resumed the countess, "the white cottage shall stand, ifyou say why you love it."The old man appeared somewhat moved; he crossed and uncrossed his legs;took out his snuff-box, returned it to his pocket without opening it;then, looking at the countess--"You will not pull it down?" he said,indicating with his thin and tremulous hand the habitation visible atthe horizon."I promise you I will not.""Well, so be it; I will do that much for them; I will save the house inwhich they were happy.""Ladies," continued the old man, "I am but a poor speaker; but I believethat even the least eloquent succeed in making themselves understoodwhen they tell what they have seen. This story, I warn you beforehand,is not gay. To dance and to sing, people send for a musician; they callin the physician when they suffer, and are near to death."A circle was formed round Dr Barnaby, who, his hands still crossed uponhis cane, quietly commenced the following narrative, to an audienceprepared beforehand to smile at his discourse."It was a long time ago, when I was young--for, I, too, have been young!Youth is a fortune that belongs to all the world--to the poor as wellas to the rich--but which abides with none. I had just passed myexamination; I had taken my physician's degree, and I returned to myvillage to exercise my wonderful talents, well convinced that, thanks tome, men would now cease to die."My village is not far from here. From the little window of my room, Ibehold yonder white house upon the opposite side to that you nowdiscern. You certainly would not find my village handsome. In my eyes,it was superb; I was born there, and I loved it. We all see with our owneyes the things we love. God suffers us to be sometimes a little blind;for He well knows that in this lower world a clear sight is not alwaysprofitable. To me, then, this neighbourhood appeared smiling andpleasant, and I lived happily. The white cottage alone, each morningwhen I opened my shutters, impressed me disagreeably: it was alwaysclosed, still and sad like a forsaken thing. Never had I seen itswindows open and shut, or its door ajar; never had I known itsinhospitable garden-gate give passage to human being. Your uncle, madam,who had no occasion for a cottage so near his chateau, sought to let it;but the rent was rather higher than anybody here was rich enough togive. It remained empty, therefore, whilst in the hamlet every windowexhibited two or three children's faces peering through the branches ofgillyflower at the first noise in the street. But one morning, ongetting up, I was quite astonished to see a long ladder resting againstthe cottage wall; a painter was painting the window-shutters green,whilst a maid-servant polished the panes, and a gardener hoed theflower-beds."'All the better,' said I to myself; 'a good roof like that, whichcovers no one, is so much lost.'"From day to day the house improved in appearance. Pots of flowersveiled the nudity of the walls; the parterres were planted, the walksweeded and gravelled, and muslin curtains, white as snow, shone in thesun-rays. One day a post-chaise rattled through the village, and droveup to the little house. Who were the strangers? None knew, and alldesired to learn. For a long time nothing transpired without of whatpassed within the dwelling. The rose-trees bloomed, and the fresh-laidlawn grew verdant; still nothing was known. Many were the commentariesupon the mystery. They were adventurers concealing themselves--they werea young man and his mistress--in short, everything was guessed exceptthe truth. The truth is so simple, that one does not always think of it;once the mind is in movement, it seeks to the right and to the left, andoften forgets to look straight before it. The mystery gave me littleconcern. No matter who is there, thought I; they are human, thereforethey will not be long without suffering, and then they will send for me.I waited patiently."At last one morning a messenger came from Mr William Meredith, torequest me to call upon him. I put on my best coat, and, endeavouring toassume a gravity suitable to my profession, I traversed the village, notwithout some little pride at my importance. That day many envied me. Thevillagers stood at their doors to see me pass. 'He is going to the whitecottage!' they said; whilst I, avoiding all appearance of haste andvulgar curosity, walked deliberately, nodding to my peasant neighbours.'Good-day, my friends,' I said; 'I will see you by-and-by; this morningI am busy.' And thus I reached the hill-side."On entering the sitting-room of the mysterious house, the scene Ibeheld rejoiced my eyesight. Everything was so simple and elegant.Flowers, the chief ornament of the apartment, were so tastefullyarranged, that gold would not better have embellished the modestinterior. White muslin was at the windows, white calico on thechairs--that was all; but there were roses, and jessamine, and flowersof all kinds, as in a garden. The light was softened by the curtains,the atmosphere was fragrant; and a young girl or woman, fair and freshas all that surrounded her, reclined upon a sofa, and welcomed me witha smile. A handsome young man, seated near her upon an ottoman, rosewhen the servant announced Dr Barnaby."'Sir,' said he, with a strong foreign accent, 'I have heard so much ofyour skill that I expected to see an old man.'"'I have studied diligently, sir,' I replied. 'I am deeply impressedwith the importance and responsibility of my calling: you may confidein me.'"''Tis well," he said. 'I recommend my wife to your best care. Herpresent state demands advice and precaution. She was born in a distantland: for my sake she has quitted family and friends. I can bring butmy affection to her aid, for I am without experience. I reckon upon you,sir. If possible, preserve her from all suffering.'"As he spoke, the young man fixed upon his wife a look so full of love,that the large blue eyes of the beautiful foreigner glistened with tearsof gratitude. She dropped the tiny cap she was embroidering, and her twohands clasped the hand of her husband. I looked at them, and I ought tohave found their lot enviable, but somehow or other, the contrary wasthe case. I felt sad; I could not tell why. I had often seen personsweep, of whom I said--They are happy! I saw William Meredith and hiswife smile, and I could not help thinking they had much sorrow. I seatedmyself near my charming patient. Never have I seen anything so lovely asthat sweet face, shaded by long ringlets of fair hair."'What is your age, madam?'"'Seventeen.'"'Is the climate of your native country very different from ours?'"'I was born in America--at New Orleans. Oh! the sun is far brighterthan here.'"Doubtless she feared she had uttered a regret, for she added--"'But every country is beautiful when one is in one's husband's house,with him, and awaiting his child!'"Her gaze sought that of William Meredith: then, in a tongue I did notunderstand, she spoke a few words which sounded so soft that they musthave been words of love."After a short visit I took my leave, promising to return. I did return,and, at the end of two months, I was almost the friend of this youngcouple. Mr and Mrs Meredith were not selfish in their happiness; theyfound time to think of others. They saw that to the poor village doctor,whose sole society was that of peasants, those days were festivalsupon which he passed an hour in hearing the language of cities. Theyencouraged me to frequent them--talked to me of their travels, and soon,with the prompt confidence characterising youth, they told me theirstory. It was the girl-wife who spoke:--"'Doctor,' she said, 'yonder, beyond the seas, I have father, sisters,family, friends, whom I long loved, until the day when I loved William.But then I shut my heart to those who repulsed my lover. William'sfather forbade him to wed me, because he was too noble for the daughterof an American planter. My father forbade me to love William, because hewas too proud to give his daughter to a man whose family refused her awelcome. They tried to separate us; but we loved each other. Long didwe weep and supplicate, and implore the pity of those to whom we owedobedience; they remained inflexible, and we loved! Doctor, did you everlove? I would you had, that you might be indulgent to us. We weresecretly married, and we fled to France. Oh how beautiful the oceanappeared in those early days of our affection! The sea was hospitable tothe fugitives. Wanderers upon the waves, we passed happy days in theshadow of our vessel's sails, anticipating pardon from our friends, anddreaming a bright future. Alas! we were too sanguine. They pursued us;and, upon pretext of some irregularity of form in our clandestinemarriage, William's family cruelly thought to separate us. We foundconcealment in the midst of these mountains and forests. Under a namewhich is not ours, we live unknown. My father has not forgiven--he hascursed me! That is the reason, doctor, why I cannot always smile, evenwith my dear William by my side.'"How those two loved each other! Never have I seen a being morecompletely wrapped up in another than was Eva Meredith in her husband!Whatever her occupation, she always so placed herself, that, on raisingher eyes, she had William before them. She never read but in the book hewas reading. Her head against his shoulder, her eyes followed the lineson which William's eyes were fixed; she wished the same thoughts tostrike them at the same moment; and, when I crossed the garden to reachtheir door, I smiled to see upon the gravel the trace of Eva's littlefoot always close to the mark of William's boot. What a differencebetween the deserted old house you see yonder, and the pretty dwellingof my young friends! What sweet flowers covered the walls! What brightnosegays decked the tables! How many charming books were there, full oftales of love that resembled their love! How gay the birds that sangaround them! How good it was to live there, and to be loved a little bythose who loved each other so much! But those are right who say thathappy days are not long upon this earth, and that, in respect ofhappiness, God gives but a little at a time."One morning Eva Meredith appeared to suffer. I questioned her with allthe interest I felt for her. She answered me abruptly."'Do not feel my pulse, doctor,' she said; 'it is my heart that beatstoo quick. Think me childish if you will, but I am sad this morning.William is going away. He is going to the town beyond the mountain, toreceive money.'"'And when will he return?' inquired I, gently."She smiled, almost blushed, and then, with a look that seemed to say,Do not laugh at me, she replied, '_This evening!_'"Notwithstanding her imploring glance, I could not repress a smile. Justthen a servant brought Mr Meredith's horse to the door. Eva rose fromher seat, went out into the garden, approached the horse, and, whilststroking his mane, bowed her head upon the animal's neck, perhaps toconceal the tear that fell from her eyes. William came out, threwhimself lightly into the saddle, and gently raised his wife's head."'Silly girl!' said he, with love in his eyes and voice. And he kissedher brow."'William, we have never yet been so many hours apart!'"Mr Meredith stooped his head towards that of Eva, and imprinted asecond kiss upon her beautiful golden hair; then he touched his horse'sflank with the spur, and set off at a gallop. I am convinced that he,too, was a little moved. Nothing is so contagious as the weakness ofthose we love; tears summon tears, and it is no very laudable couragethat keeps our eyes dry by the side of a weeping friend. I turned mysteps homeward, and, once more in my cottage, I set myself to meditateon the happiness of loving. I asked myself if an Eva would ever cheer mypoor dwelling. I did not think of examining whether I were worthy to beloved. When we behold two beings thus devoted to each other, we easilydiscern that it is not for good and various reasons that they love sowell; they love because it is necessary, inevitable; they love onaccount of their own hearts, not of those of others. Well, I thoughthow I might seek and find a heart that had need to love, just as, inmy morning walks, I might have thought to meet, by the road-side, someflower of sweet perfume. Thus did I muse, although it is perhaps a wrongfeeling which makes us, at sight of others' bliss, deplore the happinesswe do not ourselves possess. Is not a little envy there? and if joycould be stolen like gold, should we not then be near a larceny?"The day passed, and I had just completed my frugal supper, when Ireceived a message from Mrs Meredith, begging me to visit her. In fiveminutes I was at the door of the white cottage. I found Eva, stillalone, seated on a sofa, without work or book, pale and trembling.'Come, doctor, come,' said she, in her soft voice; 'I can remain aloneno longer; see how late it is!--he should have been home two hours ago,and has not yet returned!'"I was surprised at Mr Meredith's prolonged absence; but, to comfort hiswife, I replied quietly, 'How can we tell the time necessary to transacthis business? They may have made him wait; the notary was perhapsabsent. There were papers to draw up and sign.'"'Ah, doctor, I was sure you would find words of consolation! I neededto hear some one tell me that it is foolish to tremble thus! Graciousheaven, how long the day has been! Doctor, are there really personswho live alone? Do they not die immediately, as if robbed of half theatmosphere essential to life? But there is eight o'clock!' Eight o'clockwas indeed striking. I could not imagine why William was not back. Atall hazards I said to Mrs Meredith, 'Madam, the sun is hardly set; itis still daylight, and the evening is beautiful; come and visit yourflowers. If we walk down the road, we shall doubtless meet yourhusband.'"She took my arm, and we walked towards the gate of the little garden. Iendeavoured to turn her attention to surrounding objects. At first shereplied, as a child obeys. But I felt that her thoughts went not withher words. Her anxious gaze was fixed upon the little green gate, whichhad remained open since William's departure. Leaning upon the paling,she suffered me to talk on, smiling from time to time, by way of thanks;for, as the evening wore away, she lacked courage to answer me. Greytints succeeded the red sunset, foreshadowing the arrival of night.Gloom gathered around us. The road, hitherto visible like a white linewinding through the forest, disappeared in the dark shade of the loftytrees, and the village clock struck nine. Eva started. I myself feltevery stroke vibrate upon my heart. I pitied the poor woman'suneasiness."'Remember, madam,' I replied (she had not spoken, but I answered theanxiety visible in her features), 'remember that Mr Meredith must returnat a walk; the roads through the forest are not in a state to admitfast riding.' I said this to encourage her; but the truth is, I knew nothow to explain William's absence. Knowing the distance, I also knew thatI could have gone twice to the town and back since his departure. Theevening dew began to penetrate our clothes, and especially Eva's thinmuslin dress. Again I drew her arm through mine and led her towards thehouse. She followed unresistingly; her gentle nature was submissive evenin affliction. She walked slowly, her head bowed, her eyes fixed on thetracks left by the gallop of her husband's horse. How melancholy it was,that evening walk, still without William! In vain we listened: therereigned around us the profound stillness of a summer night in thecountry. How greatly does a feeling of uneasiness increase under suchcircumstances. We entered the house. Eva seated herself on the sofa, herhands clasped upon her knees, her head sunk upon her bosom. There was alamp on the chimney-piece, whose light fell full upon her face. I shallnever forget its suffering expression. She was pale, very pale--her browand cheeks exactly the same colour; her hair, relaxed by the night-damp,fell in disorder upon her shoulders. Tears filled her eyes, and thequivering of her colourless lips showed how violent was the effort bywhich she avoided shedding them. She was so young that her faceresembled that of a child forbidden to cry."I was greatly troubled, and knew not what to say or how to look.Suddenly I remembered (it was a doctor's thought) that Eva, engrossedby her uneasiness, had taken nothing since morning, and her situationrendered it imprudent to prolong this fast. At my first reference to thesubject she raised her eyes to mine with a reproachful expression, andthe motion of her eyelids caused two tears to flow down her cheeks."'For your child's sake, madam,' said I."'Ah, you are right!' she murmured, and she passed into the dining-room;but there the little table was laid for two, and at that moment thistrifle so saddened me as to deprive me of speech and motion. Myincreasing uneasiness rendered me quite awkward; I had not the wit tosay what I did not think. The silence was prolonged; 'and yet,' said Ito myself, 'I am here to console her; she sent for me for that purpose.There must be fifty ways of explaining this delay--let me find one.' Isought, and sought--and still I remained silent, inwardly cursing thepoverty of invention of a poor village doctor. Eva, her head resting onher hand, forgot to eat. Suddenly she turned to me and burst outsobbing."'Ah, doctor!' she exclaimed, 'I see plainly that you too are uneasy.'"'Not so, madam--indeed not so,' replied I, speaking at random. 'Whyshould I be uneasy? He has doubtless dined with the notary. The roadsare safe, and no one knows that he went for money.'"I had inadvertently revealed one of my secret causes of uneasiness. Iknew that a band of foreign reapers had that morning passed through thevillage, on their way to a neighbouring department."Eva uttered a cry."'Robbers! robbers!' she exclaimed. 'I never thought of _that_ danger.'"'But, madam, I only mention it to tell you it does not exist.'"'Oh! the thought struck you, doctor, because you thought the misfortunepossible! William, my own William! why did you leave me?' cried she,weeping bitterly."I was in despair at my blunder, and I felt my eyes fill with tears. Mydistress gave me an idea."'Mrs Meredith,' I said, 'I cannot see you torment yourself thus, andremain by your side unable to console you. I will go and seek yourhusband; I will follow at random one of the paths through the forest; Iwill search everywhere and shout his name, and go, if necessary, to thetown itself.'"'Oh, thanks, thanks, kind friend!' cried Eva Meredith, 'take thegardener with you and the servant; search in all directions!'"We hurried back into the drawing-room, and Eva rang quickly andrepeatedly. All the inhabitants of the cottage opened at the same timethe different doors of the apartment. 'Follow Dr Barnaby,' cried MrsMeredith."At that moment a horse's gallop was distinctly heard upon the gravelof the garden. Eva uttered a cry of happiness that went home to everyheart. Never shall I forget the divine expression of joy that illuminedher face, still inundated with tears. She and I, we flew to thehouse-door. The moon, passing from behind a cloud, threw her full lightupon a riderless and foam-covered horse, whose bridle dragged upon theground, and whose dusty flanks were galled by the empty stirrups. Asecond cry, this time of intensest horror, burst from Eva's breast; thenshe turned towards me, her eyes fixed, her mouth half open, her armshanging powerless."The servants were in consternation."'Get torches, my friends!' cried I, 'and follow me! Madam, we shallsoon return, I hope, and your husband with us. He has received someslight hurt, a strained ankle, perhaps. Keep up your courage. We willsoon be back.'"'I go with you!' murmured Eva Meredith in a choking voice."'Impossible!' I cried. 'We must go fast, perhaps far, and in yourstate--it would be risking your life, and that of your child--'"'I go with you!' repeated Eva."Then did I feel how cruel was this poor woman's isolation! Had afather, a mother been there, they would have ordered her to stay, theywould have retained her by force; but she was alone upon the earth, andto all my hurried entreaties she still replied in a hollow voice: 'I gowith you!'"We set out. The moon was again darkened by dense clouds; there waslight neither in the heavens nor on the earth. The uncertain radiance ofour torches barely showed us the path. A servant went in front, loweringhis torch to the right and to the left, to illumine the ditches andbushes bordering the road. Behind him Mrs Meredith, the gardener, andmyself, followed with our eyes the stream of light. From time to timewe raised our voices and called Mr Meredith. After us a stifled sobmurmured the name of William, as if a heart had reckoned on the instinctof love to hear its tears better than our shouts. We reached the forest.Rain began to fall, and the drops pattered upon the foliage with amournful noise, as if everything around us wept. Eva's thin dress wassoon soaked with the cold flood. The water streamed from her hair overher face. She bruised her feet against the stones of the road, andrepeatedly stumbled and fell upon her knees; but she rose again with theenergy of despair, and pushed forwards. It was agonising to behold her.I scarcely dared look at her, lest I should see her fall dead before myeyes. At last--we were moving in silence, fatigued and discouraged--MrsMeredith pushed us suddenly aside, sprang forward and plunged into thebushes. We followed her, and, upon raising the torches--alas! she was onher knees beside the body of William, who was stretched motionless uponthe ground, his eyes glazed and his brow covered with blood which flowedfrom a wound in the left temple."'Doctor?' said Eva to me. That one word expressed--'Does William live?'"I stooped and felt the pulse of William Meredith; I placed my hand onhis heart and remained silent. Eva still gazed at me; but, when mysilence was prolonged, I saw her bend, waver, and then, without word orcry, fall senseless upon her husband's corpse."But, ladies," said Dr Barnaby, turning to his audience, "the sun shinesagain; you can go out now. Let us leave this sad story where it is."Madame de Moncar approached the old physician. "Doctor," said she, "Iimplore you to continue; only look at us, and you will not doubt theinterest with which we listen."There were no more smiles of mockery upon the young faces thatsurrounded the village doctor. In some of their eyes he might evendistinguish the glistening of tears. He resumed his narrative."Mrs Meredith was carried home, and remained for several hours senselessupon her bed. I felt it at once a duty and a cruelty to use every effortto recall her to life. I dreaded the agonising scenes that would followthis state of immobility. I remained beside the poor woman, bathing hertemples with fresh water, and awaiting with anxiety the sad and yetthe happy moment of returning consciousness. I was mistaken in myanticipations, for I had never witnessed great grief. Eva half openedher eyes and immediately closed them again; no tear escaped from beneaththeir lids. She remained cold, motionless, silent; and, but for theheart which again throbbed beneath my hand, I should have deemedher dead. Sad is it to behold a sorrow which one feels is beyondconsolation! Silence, I thought, seemed like a want of pity for thisunfortunate creature: on the other hand, verbal condolence was a mockeryof so mighty a grief. I had found no words to calm her uneasiness; couldI hope to be more eloquent in the hour of her great suffering? I tookthe safest course, that of profound silence. I will remain here, Ithought, and minister to the physical sufferings, as is my duty; but Iwill be mute and passive, even as a faithful dog would lie down at herfeet. My mind once made up, I felt calmer; I let her live a life whichresembled death. After a few hours, however, I put a spoonful of apotion to her lips. Eva slowly averted her head. In a few moments Iagain offered her the drug."'Drink, madam,' I said, gently touching her lips with the spoon. Theyremained closed."'Madam, your child!' I persisted in a low voice."Eva opened her eyes, raised herself with effort upon her elbow,swallowed the medicine, and fell back upon her pillow."'I must wait,' she murmured, 'till another life is detached from mine!'"Thenceforward Mrs Meredith spoke no more, but she mechanically followedall my prescriptions. Stretched upon her bed of suffering, she seemedconstantly to sleep; but at whatever moment I said to her, even in mylowest whisper, 'Drink this,' she instantly obeyed; thus proving to methat the soul kept its weary watch in that motionless body, without asingle instant of oblivion and repose."There were none beside myself to attend to the interment of William.Nothing positive was ever known as to the cause of his death. The sum hewas to bring from the town was not found upon him; perhaps he had beenrobbed and murdered; perhaps the money, which was in notes, had fallenfrom his pocket when he was thrown from his horse, and, as it was sometime before any thought of seeking it, the heavy rain and trampled mudmight account for its disappearance. A fruitless investigation was madeand soon dropped. I endeavoured to learn from Eva Meredith if herfamily, or that of her husband, should not be written to. I haddifficulty in obtaining an answer. At last she gave me to understandthat I had merely to inform their agent, who would do whatever wasneedful. I hoped that, at least from England, some communication wouldarrive, decisive of this poor creature's future lot. But no; dayfollowed day, and none seemed to know that the widow of William Meredithlived in utter isolation, in a poor French village. To endeavour tobring back Eva to the sense of her existence, I urged her to leave herbed. Upon the morrow I found her up, dressed in black; but she was theghost of the beautiful Eva Meredith. Her hair was parted in bands uponher pale forehead, and she sat near a window, motionless as she had lainin bed."I passed long silent evenings with her, a book in my hand for apparentoccupation. Each day, on my arrival, I addressed to her a few words ofsympathy. She replied by a thankful look; then we remained silent. Iwaited an opportunity to open a conversation; but my awkwardness and myrespect for her grief prevented my finding one, or suffered it to escapewhen it occurred. Little by little I grew accustomed to this muteintercourse; and, besides, what could I have said to her? My chiefobject was to prevent her feeling quite alone in the world; and, obscureas was the prop remaining, it still was something. I went to see hermerely that my presence might say, 'I am here.'"It was a singular epoch in my life, and had a great influence on myfuture existence. Had I not shown so much regret at the threateneddestruction of the white cottage, I would hurry to the conclusion ofthis narrative. But you have insisted upon knowing why that building ishallowed to me, and I must tell you therefore what I have thought andfelt beneath its humble roof. Forgive me, ladies, if my words are grave.It is good for youth to be sometimes a little saddened; it has so muchtime before it to laugh and to forget."The son of a rich peasant, I was sent to Paris to complete my studies.During four years passed in that great city, I retained the awkwardnessof my manners, the simplicity of my language, but I rapidly lost theingenuousness of my sentiments. I returned to these mountains, almostlearned, but almost incredulous in all those points of faith whichenable a man to pass his life contentedly beneath a thatched roof, inthe society of his wife and children, without caring to look beyond thecross above the village cemetery."Whilst contemplating the love of William and of Eva, I had reverted tomy former simple peasant-nature. I began to dream of a virtuous,affectionate wife, diligent and frugal, embellishing my house by hercare and order. I saw myself proud of the gentle severity of herfeatures, revealing to all the chaste and faithful spouse. Verydifferent were these reveries from those that haunted me at Paris afterjoyous evenings spent with my comrades. Suddenly, horrible calamitydescended like a thunderbolt upon Eva Meredith. This time I was slowerto appreciate the lesson I daily received. Eva sat constantly at thewindow, her sad gaze fixed upon the heavens. The attitude, common inpersons of meditative mood, attracted my attention but little. Herpersistence in it at last struck me. My book open upon my knees, Ilooked at Mrs Meredith; and well assured she would not detect my gaze, Iexamined her attentively. She still gazed at the sky--my eyes followedthe direction of hers. 'Ah,' I said to myself with a half smile, 'shethinks to rejoin him _there_!' Then I resumed my book, thinking howfortunate it was for the weakness of women that such thoughts came tothe relief of their sorrows."I have already told you that my student's life had put evil thoughtsinto my head. Every day, however, I saw Eva in the same attitude, andevery day my reflections were recalled to the same subject. Little bylittle I came to think her dream a good one, and to regret I could notcredit its reality. The soul, heaven, eternal life, all that the oldpriest had formerly taught me, glided through my imagination as I sat ateventide before the open window. 'The doctrine of the old _cure_,' Isaid to myself, 'was more comforting than the cold realities science hasrevealed to me.' Then I looked at Eva, who still looked to heaven,whilst the bells of the village church sounded sweetly in the distance,and the rays of the setting sun made the steeple cross glitter againstthe sky. I often returned to sit opposite the poor widow, persevering inher grief as in her holy hopes."'What!' I thought, 'can so much love address itself to a few particlesof dust, already mingled with the mould; are all these sighs wasted onempty air? William departed in the freshness of his age, his affectionsyet vivid, his heart in its early bloom. She loved him but a year, onelittle year--and is all over for her? Above our heads is there nothingbut void? Love--that sentiment so strong within us--is it but a flameplaced in the obscure prison of our body, where it shines, burns, and isfinally extinguished by the fall of the frail wall surrounding it? Is alittle dust all that remains of our loves, and hopes, and passions--ofall that moves, agitates, and exalts us?'"There was deep silence in the recesses of my soul. I had ceased tothink. I was as if slumbering between what I no longer denied, and whatI did not yet believe. At last, one night, when Eva joined her hands topray, beneath the most beautiful starlit sky possible to behold, I knownot how it was, but I found my hands also clasped, and my lips opened tomurmur a prayer. Then, by a happy chance, and for the first time, EvaMeredith looked round, as if a secret instinct had whispered her that mysoul harmonised with hers."'Thanks,' said she, holding out her hand, 'keep him in your memory, andpray for him sometimes.'"'Oh, madam!' I exclaimed, 'may we all meet again in a better world,whether our lives have been long or short, happy or full of trial.'"'His immortal soul looks down upon us!' she replied in a grave voice,whilst her gaze, at once sad and bright, reverted to the star-spangledheavens."Since that evening, when performing the duties of my profession, I haveoften witnessed death; but never without speaking to the sorrowingsurvivors a few consoling words on a better life than this one; andthose words were words of conviction."At last, a month after these incidents, Eva Meredith gave birth to ason. When they brought her her child,--'William!' exclaimed the poorwidow; and tears, soothing tears too long denied to her grief, escapedin torrents from her eyes. The child bore that much-loved name ofWilliam, and a little cradle was placed close to the mother's bed. ThenEva's gaze, long directed to heaven, returned earthwards. She looked toher child now, as she had previously looked to her God. She bent overhim to seek his father's features. Providence had permitted an exactresemblance between William and the son he was fated not to see. A greatchange occurred around us. Eva, who had consented to live until herchild's existence was detached from hers, was now, I could plainly see,willing to live on, because she felt that this little being needed theprotection of her love. She passed the days and evenings seated besidehis cradle; and when I went to see her, oh! then she questioned me as towhat she should do for him, she explained what he had suffered, andasked what could be done to save him from pain. For her child she fearedthe heat of a ray of sun, the chill of the lightest breeze. Bending overhim, she shielded him with her body, and warmed him with her kisses. Oneday, I almost thought I saw her smile at him. But she never would sing,whilst rocking his cradle, to lull him to sleep; she called one of herwomen, and said, 'Sing to my son that he may sleep.' Then she listened,letting her tears flow softly upon little William's brow. Poor child! hewas handsome, gentle, easy to rear. But, as if his mother's sorrow hadaffected him even before his birth, the child was melancholy: he seldomcried, but he never smiled: he was quiet; and at that age quiet seemsto denote suffering. I fancied that all the tears shed over the cradlefroze that poor little soul. I would fain have seen William's armstwined caressingly round his mother's neck. I would have had him returnthe kisses lavished upon him. 'But what am I thinking about?' I thensaid to myself; 'is it reasonable to expect that a little creature, notyet a year upon the earth, should understand that it is sent hither tolove and console this woman?'"It was, I assure you, a touching sight to behold this young mother,pale, feeble, and who had once renounced existence, clinging again tolife for the sake of a little child which could not even say 'Thanks,dear mother!' What a marvel is the human heart! Of how small a thing itmakes much! Give it but a grain of sand, and it elevates a mountain; atits latest throb show it but an atom to love, and again its pulsesrevive; it stops for good only when all is void around it, and when eventhe shadow of its affections has vanished from the earth!"Time rolled on, and I received a letter from an uncle, my solesurviving relative. My uncle, a member of the faculty of Montpellier,summoned me to his side, to complete in that learned town my initiationinto the secrets of my art. This letter, in form an invitation, wasin fact an order. I had to set out. One morning, my heart big when Ithought of the isolation in which I left the widow and the orphan, Irepaired to the white cottage to take leave of Eva Meredith. I know notwhether an additional shade of sadness came over her features when Itold her I was about to make a long absence. Since the death of WilliamMeredith such profound melancholy dwelt upon her countenance that asmile would have been the sole perceptible variation: sadness was alwaysthere."'You leave us?' she exclaimed; 'your care is so useful to my child!'"The poor lonely woman forgot to regret the departure of her lastfriend; the mother lamented the loss of the physician useful to her son.I did not complain. To be useful is the sweet recompense of the devoted."'Adieu!' she said, holding out her hand. 'Wherever you go, may Godbless you; and should it be His will to afflict you, may He at leastafford you the sympathy of a heart compassionate as your own.'"I bowed over the hand of Eva Meredith; and I departed, deeply moved."The child was in the garden in front of the house, lying upon thegrass, in the sun. I took him in my arms and kissed him repeatedly; Ilooked at him long, attentively, sadly, and a tear started to my eyes.'Oh, no, no! I must be mistaken!' I murmured, and I hurried from thewhite cottage.""Good heavens, doctor!" simultaneously exclaimed all Dr Barnaby'saudience, "what did you apprehend?""Suffer me to finish my story my own way," replied the village doctor;"everything shall be told in its turn. I relate these events in theorder in which they occurred."On my arrival at Montpellier, I was exceedingly well received by myuncle; who declared, however, that he could neither lodge nor feed me,nor lend me money, and that as a stranger, without a name, I must nothope for a patient in a town so full of celebrated physicians."'Then I will return to my village, uncle,' replied I."'By no means!' was his answer. 'I have got you a lucrative andrespectable situation. An old Englishman, rich, gouty, and restless,wishes to have a doctor to live with him, an intelligent young man whowill take charge of his health under the superintendence of an olderphysician. I have proposed you--you have been accepted; let us go tohim.'"We betook ourselves immediately to the residence of Lord JamesKysington, a large and handsome house, full of servants, where, afterwaiting some time, first in the anteroom, and then in the parlours, wewere at last ushered into the presence of the noble invalid. Seated ina large arm-chair was an old man of cold and severe aspect, whose whitehair contrasted oddly with his eyebrows, still of a jet black. He wastall and thin, as far as I could judge through the folds of a largecloth coat, made like a dressing-gown. His hands disappeared under hiscuffs, and his feet were wrapped in the skin of a white bear. A numberof medicine vials were upon a table beside him."'My lord, this is my nephew, Dr Barnaby.'"Lord Kysington bowed--that is to say, he looked at me, and made ascarcely perceptible movement with his head."'He is well versed in his profession, and I doubt not that his carewill be most beneficial to your lordship.'"A second movement of the head was the sole reply vouchsafed."'Moreover,' continued my relation, 'having had a tolerably goodeducation, he can read to your lordship, or write under your dictation.'"'I shall be obliged to him,' replied Lord Kysington, breaking silenceat last, and then closing his eyes, either from fatigue, or as a hintthat the conversation was to drop. I glanced around me. Near the windowsat a lady, very elegantly dressed, who continued her embroidery withoutonce raising her eyes, as if we were not worthy her notice. Upon thecarpet at her feet a little boy amused himself with toys. The lady,although young, did not at first strike me as pretty--because she hadblack hair and eyes; and to be pretty, according to my notion, was tobe fair, like Eva Meredith; and, moreover, in my inexperience, I heldbeauty impossible without a certain air of goodness. It was long beforeI could admit the beauty of this woman, whose brow was haughty, her lookdisdainful, and her mouth unsmiling. Like Lord Kysington, she was tall,thin, rather pale. In character they were too much alike to suit eachother well. Formal and taciturn, they lived together without affection,almost without converse. The child, too, had been taught silence; hewalked on tiptoe, and at the least noise a severe look from his motheror from Lord Kysington changed him into a statue."It was too late to return to my village; but it is never too late toregret what one has loved and lost. My heart ached when I thought ofmy cottage, my valley, my liberty."What I learned concerning the cheerless family I had entered was asfollows:--Lord James Kysington had come to Montpellier for his health,deteriorated by the climate of India. Second son of the Duke ofKysington, and a lord only by courtesy, he owed to talent and not toinheritance his fortune and his political position in the House ofCommons. Lady Mary was the wife of his youngest brother; and Lord James,free to dispose of his fortune, had named her son his heir."Towards me his lordship was most punctiliously polite. A bow thankedme for every service I rendered him. I read aloud for hours together,uninterrupted either by the sombre old man, whom I put to sleep, or bythe young woman, who did not listen to me, or by the child, who trembledin his uncle's presence. I had never led so melancholy a life, and yet,as you know, ladies, the little white cottage had long ceased to begay; but the silence of misfortune implies reflections that words areinsufficient to express. One feels the life of the soul under thestillness of the body. In my new abode it was the silence of a void."One day that Lord James dozed and Lady Mary was engrossed withembroidery, little Harry climbed upon my knee, as I sat apart at thefarther end of the room, and began to question me with the artlesscuriosity of his age. In my turn, and without reflecting on what Isaid, I questioned him concerning his family."'Have you any brothers or sisters?' I inquired."'I have a very pretty little sister.'"'What is her name?' asked I, absently, glancing at the newspaper inmy hand."'She has a beautiful name. Guess it, Doctor.'"I know not what I was thinking about. In my village I had heard nonebut the names of peasants, hardly applicable to Lady Mary's daughter.Mrs Meredith was the only lady I had known, and the child repeating,'Guess, guess!' I replied at random,"'Eva, perhaps?'"We were speaking very low; but when the name of Eva escaped my lips,Lord James opened his eyes quickly, and raised himself in his chair,Lady Mary dropped her needle and turned sharply towards me. I wasconfounded at the effect I had produced; I looked alternately at LordJames and at Lady Mary, without daring to utter another word. Someminutes passed: Lord James again let his head fall back and closed hiseyes, Lady Mary resumed her needle, Harry and I ceased our conversation.I reflected for some time upon this strange incident, until at last, allaround me having sunk into the usual monotonous calm, I rose to leavethe room. Lady Mary pushed away her embroidery frame, passed before me,and made me a sign to follow. When we were both in another room she shutthe door, and raising her head, with the imperious air which was themost habitual expression of her features: 'Dr Barnaby,' said she, 'be sogood as never again to pronounce the name that just now escaped yourlips. It is a name Lord James Kysington must not hear.' She bowedslightly, and re-entered her brother-in-law's apartment."Thoughts innumerable crowded upon my mind. This Eva, whose name wasnot to be spoken, could it be Eva Meredith? Was she Lord Kysington'sdaughter-in-law? Was I in the house of William's father? I hoped, butstill I doubted; for, after all, if there was but one Eva in the worldfor me, in England the name was, doubtless, by no means uncommon. Butthe thought that I was perhaps with the family of Eva Meredith, livingwith the woman who robbed the widow and the orphan of their inheritance,this thought was present to me by day and by night. In my dreams Ibeheld the return of Eva and her son to the paternal residence, inconsequence of the pardon I had implored and obtained for them. But whenI raised my eyes, the cold impassible physiognomy of Lord Kysingtonfroze all the hopes of my heart. I applied myself to the examinationof  that countenance as if I had never before seen it; I analysed itsfeatures and lines to find a trace of sensibility. I sought the heart Iso gladly would have touched. Alas! I found it not. But I had so good acause that I was not to be discouraged. 'Pshaw!' I said to myself, 'whatmatters the expression of the face? why heed the external envelope? Maynot the darkest coffer contain bright gold? Must all that is within usreveal itself at a glance? Does not every man of the world learn toseparate his mind and his thoughts from the habitual expression of hiscountenance?'"I resolved to clear up my doubts, but how to do so was the difficulty.Impossible to question Lady Mary or Lord James; the servantswere French, and had but lately come to the house. An Englishvalet-de-chambre had just been despatched to London on a confidentialmission. I directed my investigations to Lord James Kysington. Thesevere expression of his countenance ceased to intimidate me. I said tomyself, 'When the forester meets with a tree apparently dead, he strikeshis axe into the trunk to see whether sap does not still survive beneaththe withered bark; in like manner will I strike at the heart, and seewhether life be not somewhere hidden.' And I only waited an opportunity."To await an opportunity with impatience is to accelerate its coming.Instead of depending on circumstances we subjugate them. One night LordJames sent for me. He was in pain. After administering the necessaryremedies, I remained by his bedside, to watch their effect. The roomwas dark; a single wax candle showed the outline of objects, withoutilluminating them. The pale and noble head of Lord James was thrownback upon his pillow. His eyes were shut, according to his custom whensuffering, as if he concentrated his moral energies within him. He nevercomplained, but lay stretched out in his bed, straight and motionless asa king's statue upon a marble tomb. In general he got somebody to readto him, hoping either to distract his thoughts from his pains, or to belulled to sleep by the monotonous sound."Upon that night he made sign to me with his meagre hand to take a bookand read, but I sought one in vain; books and newspapers had all beenremoved to the drawing-room; the doors were locked, and unless I rangand aroused the house, a book was not to be had. Lord James made agesture of impatience, then one of resignation, and beckoned me toresume my seat by his side. We remained for some time without speaking,almost in darkness, the silence broken only by the ticking of the clock.Sleep came not. Suddenly Lord James opened his eyes."'Speak to me,' he said. 'Tell me something; whatever you like.'"His eyes closed, and he waited. My heart beat violently. The moment hadcome."'My lord,' said I, 'I greatly fear I know nothing that will interestyour lordship. I can speak but of myself, of the events of my life,--andthe history of the great ones of the earth were necessary to fix yourattention. What can a peasant have to say, who has lived contented withlittle, in obscurity and repose? I have scarcely quitted my village, mylord. It is a pretty mountain hamlet, where even those not born theremight well be pleased to dwell. Near it is a country house, which I haveknown inhabited by rich people, who could have left it if they liked,but who remained, because the woods were thick, the paths bordered withflowers, the streams bright and rapid in their rocky beds. Alas! theywere two in that house--and soon a poor woman was there alone, untilthe birth of her son. My lord, she is a countrywoman of yours, anEnglishwoman, of beauty such as is seldom seen either in England or inFrance; good as, besides her, only the angels in heaven can be! Shehad just completed her eighteenth year when I left her, fatherless,motherless, and already widowed of an adored husband; she is feeble,delicate, almost ill, and yet she must live;--who would protect thatlittle child? Oh! my lord, there are very unhappy beings in this world!To be unhappy in middle life or old age is doubtless sad, but still youhave pleasant memories of the past to remind you that you have had yourday, your share, your happiness; but to weep before you are eighteen isfar sadder, for nothing can bring back the dead, and the future is dimwith tears. Poor creature! We see a beggar by the road-side sufferingfrom cold and hunger, and we give him alms, and look upon him withoutpain, because it is in our power to relieve him; but this unhappy,broken-hearted woman, the only relief to give her would be to loveher--and none are there to bestow that alms upon her!"'Ah! my lord, if you knew what a fine young man her husbandwas!--hardly three-and-twenty; a noble countenance, a lofty brow--likeyour own, intelligent and proud; dark-blue eyes, rather pensive, rathersad. I knew why they were sad. He loved his father and his native land,and he was doomed to exile from both! And how good and graceful was hissmile! Ah! how he would have smiled at his little child, had he livedlong enough to see it. He loved it even before it was born: he tookpleasure in looking at the cradle that awaited it. Poor, poor youngman!--I saw him on a stormy night, in the dark forest, stretched uponthe wet earth, motionless, lifeless, his garments covered with mud, histemples shattered, blood escaping in torrents from his wound. Isaw--alas! I saw William--'"'You saw my son's death!' cried Lord James, raising himself like aspectre in the midst of his pillows, and fixing me with eyes sodistended and piercing, that I started back alarmed. But notwithstandingthe darkness, I thought I saw a tear moisten the old man's eyelids."'My lord,' I replied, 'I was present at your son's death, and at thebirth of his child!'"There was an instant's silence. Lord James looked steadfastly at me. Atlast he made a movement; his trembling hand sought mine, pressed it,then his fingers relaxed their grasp, and he fell back upon the bed."'Enough sir, enough; I suffer, I need repose. Leave me.'"I bowed, and retired."Before I was out of the room, Lord James had relapsed into his habitualposition; into silence and immobility."I will not detail to you my numerous and respectful representations toLord James Kysington, his indecision and secret anxiety, and how at lasthis paternal love, awakened by the details of the horrible catastrophe,his pride of race, revived by the hope of leaving an heir to his name,triumphed over his bitter resentment. Three months after the scene Ihave described, I awaited, on the threshold of the house at Montpellier,the arrival of Eva Meredith and her son, summoned to their family and tothe resumption of all their rights. It was a proud and happy day for me."Lady Mary, perfect mistress of herself, had concealed her joy whenfamily dissensions had made her son heir to her wealthy brother. Stillbetter did she conceal her regret and anger when Eva Meredith, or ratherEva Kysington, was reconciled with her father-in-law. Not a cloudappeared upon Lady Mary's marble forehead. But beneath this externalcalm how many evil passions fermented!"When the carriage of Eva Meredith (I will still give her that name)entered the courtyard of the house, I was there to receive her. Eva heldout her hand--'Thanks, thanks, my friend!' she murmured. She wiped thetears that trembled in her eyes, and taking her boy, now three yearsold, and of great beauty, by the hand, she entered her new abode. 'I amafraid,' she said. She was still the weak woman, broken by affliction,pale, sad, and beautiful, incredulous of earthly hopes, but firm inheavenly faith. I walked by her side; and as she ascended the steps, hergentle countenance bedewed with tears, her slender and feeble forminclined towards the balustrade, her extended arm assisting the child,who walked still more slowly than herself, Lady Mary and her sonappeared at the door. Lady Mary wore a brown velvet dress, richbracelets encircled her arms, a slender gold chain bound her brow, whichin truth was of those on which a diadem sits well. She advanced with anassured step, her head high, her glance full of pride. Such was thefirst meeting of the two mothers."'You are welcome, madam,' said Lady Mary, bowing to Eva Meredith."Eva tried to smile, and answered by a few affectionate words. How couldshe forbode hatred, she who only knew love? We proceeded to Lord James'sroom. Mrs Meredith, scarcely able to support herself, entered first,took a few steps, and knelt beside her father-in-law's arm-chair. Takingher child in her arms, she placed him on Lord James Kysington's knee."'His son!' she said. Then the poor woman wept and was silent."Long did Lord James gaze upon the child. As he gradually recognisedthe features of the son he had lost, his eyes became moist, and theirexpression affectionate. There came a moment when, forgetting his age,lapse of time, and past misfortune, he dreamed himself back to thehappy day when he first pressed his infant son to his heart. 'William,William!' he murmured. 'My daughter!' added he, extending his hand toEva Meredith."My eyes filled with tears. Eva had a family, a protector, a fortune. Iwas happy; doubtless that was why I wept."The child remained quiet upon his grandfather's knees, and showedneither pleasure nor fear."'Will you love me?' said the old man."The child raised its head, but did not answer."'Do you hear? I will be your father.'"'I will be your father,' the child gently repeated."'Excuse him,' said his mother; 'he has always been alone. He is veryyoung; the presence of many persons intimidates him. By-and-by, my lord,he will better understand your kind words.'"But I looked at the child; I examined him in silence; I recalled myformer gloomy apprehensions. Alas! those apprehensions now became acertainty; the terrible shock experienced by Eva Meredith during herpregnancy had had fatal consequences for her child, and a mother only,in her youth, her love, and her inexperience, could have remained solong ignorant of her misfortune."At the same time with myself Lady Mary looked at the child. I shallnever forget the expression of her countenance. She stood erect, andthe piercing gaze she fixed upon little William seemed to read his verysoul. As she gazed, her eyes sparkled, her mouth was half-opened as bya smile--she breathed short and thick, like one oppressed by great andsudden joy. She looked, looked--hope, doubt, expectation, replaced eachother on her face. At last her hatred was clear-sighted, an internal cryof triumph burst from her heart, but was checked ere it reached herlips. She drew herself up, let fall a disdainful glance upon Eva, hervanquished enemy, and resumed her usual calm."Lord James, fatigued by the emotions of the day, dismissed us, andremained alone all the evening."Upon the morrow, after an agitated night, when I entered Lord James'sroom, all the family were already assembled around him, and Lady Maryhad little William on her knees: it was the tiger clutching its prey."'What a beautiful child!' she said. 'See, my lord, these fair andsilken locks! how brilliant they are in the sunshine! But, dear Eva, isyour son always so silent? does he never exhibit the vivacity and gaietyof his age?'"'He is always sad,' replied Mrs Meredith. 'Alas! with me he couldhardly learn to laugh.'"'We will try to amuse and cheer him,' said Lady Mary. 'Come, my dearchild, kiss your grandfather! hold out your arms, and tell him youlove him.'"William did not stir."'Do you not know how? Harry, my love, kiss your uncle, and set yourcousin a good example.'"Harry jumped upon Lord James's knees, threw both arms round his neck,and said, 'I love you, dear uncle!'"'Now it is your turn, my dear William,' said Lady Mary."William stirred not, and did not even look at his grandfather."A tear coursed down Eva Meredith's cheek."''Tis my fault,' she said. 'I have brought up my child badly.' And,taking William upon her lap, her tears fell upon his face: he felt themnot, but slumbered upon his mother's heavy heart."'Try to make William less shy,' said Lord James to his daughter-in-law."'I will try,' replied Eva, in her submissive tones, like those of anobedient child. 'I will try; and perhaps I shall succeed, if Lady Marywill kindly tell me how she rendered her son so happy and so gay.' Thenthe disconsolate mother looked at Harry, who was at play near hisuncle's chair, and her eyes reverted to her poor sleeping child. 'Hesuffered even before his birth,' she murmured; 'we have both been veryunhappy! but I will try to weep no more, that William may be cheerfullike other children.'"Two days elapsed, two painful days, full of secret trouble andill-concealed uneasiness. Lord James's brow was care-laden; at times hislook questioned me. I averted my eyes to avoid answering. On the morningof the third day, Lady Mary came into the room with a number ofplay-things for the children. Harry seized a sword, and ran about theroom, shouting for joy. William remained motionless, holding in hislittle hand the toys that were given to him, but not attempting to usethem; he did not even look at them."'Here, my lord,' said Lady Mary to her brother, 'give this book toyour grandson; perhaps his attention will be roused by the pictures itcontains.' And she led William to Lord James. The child was passive; hewalked, stopped, and remained like a statue where he was placed. LordJames opened the book. All eyes turned towards the group formed by theold man and his grandson. Lord James was gloomy, silent, severe; heslowly turned several pages, stopping at every picture, and looking atWilliam, whose vacant gaze was not directed to the book. Lord Jamesturned a few more pages; then his hand ceased to move; the book fellfrom his knees to the ground, and an irksome silence reigned in theapartment. Lady Mary approached me, bent forward as if to whisper inmy ear, and in a voice loud enough to be heard by all--"'The child is an idiot, doctor!' she said."A shriek answered her. Eva started up as if she had received a blow;and seizing her son, whom she pressed convulsively to her breast--"'Idiot!' she exclaimed, her indignant glance flashing, for the firsttime, with a vivid brilliance; 'idiot!' she repeated, 'because he hasbeen unhappy all his life, because he has seen but tears since his eyesfirst opened! because he knows not how to play like your son, who hasalways had joy around him! Ah! madam, you insult misfortune! Come, mychild!" cried Eva, all in tears. "Come, let us leave these pitilesshearts, that find none but cruel words to console our misery!'"And the unhappy mother carried off her boy to her apartment. Ifollowed. She set William down, and knelt before the little child.'My son! my son!' she cried."William went close to her, and rested his head on his mother'sshoulder."'Doctor!' cried Eva, 'he loves me--you see he does! He comeswhen I call him; he kisses me! His caresses have sufficed for mytranquillity--for my sad happiness! My God! was it not then enough?Speak to me, my son; reassure me! Find a consoling word, a single wordfor your despairing mother! Till now I have asked nothing of you but toremind me of your father, and leave me silence to weep. To-day, William,you must give me words! See you not my tears--my terror? Dear child, sobeautiful, so like your father, speak, speak to me!'"Alas! alas! the child remained motionless, without sign of fear orintelligence; a smile only, a smile horrible to behold, flitted acrosshis features. Eva hid her face in both hands, and remained kneeling uponthe ground. For a long time no noise was heard save the sound of hersobs. Then I prayed heaven to inspire me with consoling thoughts, suchas might give a ray of hope to this poor mother. I spoke of the future,of expected cure, of change possible--even probable. But hope is nofriend to falsehood. Where she does not exist her phantom cannotpenetrate. A terrible blow, a mortal one, had been struck, and EvaMeredith saw all the truth."From that day forwards, only one child was to be seen each morning inLord James Kysington's room. Two women came thither, but only one ofthem seemed to live--the other was silent as the tomb. One said, 'Myson!' the other never spoke of her child; one carried her head high, theother bowed hers upon her breast, the better to hide her tears; one wasblooming and brilliant, the other pale and a mourner. The struggle wasat an end. Lady Mary triumphed. It was cruel how they let Harry playbefore Eva Meredith's eyes. Careless of her anguish, they brought him torepeat his lessons in his uncle's presence; they vaunted his progress.The ambitious mother calculated everything to consolidate her success;and, whilst abounding in honeyed words and feigned consolation, shetortured Eva Meredith's heart each moment in the day. Lord James,smitten in his dearest hopes, had resumed the cold impassibility whichI now saw formed the foundation of his character. Strictly courteous tohis daughter-in-law, he had no word of affection for her: only as themother of his grandson could the daughter of the American planter finda place in his heart. And he considered the child as no longer inexistence. Lord James Kysington was more gloomy and taciturn than ever,regretting, perhaps, to have yielded to my importunities, and to haveruffled his old age by a painful and profitless emotion."A year elapsed; then a sad day came, when Lord James sent for EvaMeredith, and signed to her to be seated beside his arm-chair."'Listen to me, madam,' he said, 'listen with courage. I will actfrankly with you, and conceal nothing. I am old and ill, and mustarrange my affairs. The task is painful both for you and for me. I willnot refer to my anger at my son's marriage; your misfortune disarmedme--I called you to my side, and I desired to behold and to love in yourson William, the heir of my fortune, the pivot of my dreams of futureambition. Alas! madam, fate was cruel to us! My son's widow and orphanshall have all that can insure them an honourable existence; but, solemaster of a fortune due to my own exertions, I adopt my nephew, and lookupon him henceforward as my sole heir. I am about to return to London,whither my affairs call me. Come with me, madam--my house is yours--Ishall be happy to see you there.'"Eva (she afterwards told me so) felt, for the first time, herdespondency replaced by courage. She had the strength that is given bya noble pride: she raised her head, and her brow, less haughty thanthat of Lady Mary, wore all the dignity of misfortune."'Go, my lord,' she answered, 'go; I shall not accompany you. I will notwitness the usurpation of my son's rights! You are in haste to condemn,my lord. Who can foresee the future! You are in haste to despair of themercy of God!'"'The future,' replied Lord James, 'at my age, is bounded by the passingday. What I would be certain to do I must do at once and without delay.'"'Act as you think proper,' replied Eva. 'I return to the dwellingwhere I was happy with my husband. I return thither with your grandson,William Kysington; of that name, his sole inheritance, you cannotdeprive him; and though the world should know it but by reading it onhis tomb, your name, my lord, is the name of my son!'"A week later, Eva Meredith descended the stairs of the hotel, holdingher son by the hand, as she had done when she had entered this fatalhouse. Lady Mary was a little behind her, a few steps higher up: thenumerous servants, sad and silent, beheld with regret the departure ofthe gentle creature thus driven from the paternal roof. When she quittedthis abode, Eva quitted the only beings she knew upon the earth, theonly persons whose pity she had a right to claim--the world was beforeher, an immense wilderness. It was Hagar going forth into the desert.""This is horrible, doctor!" cried Dr Barnaby's audience. "Is it possiblethere are persons so utterly unhappy? What! you witnessed all thisyourself?""I have not yet told you all," replied the village doctor; "let me getto the end."Shortly after Eva Meredith's departure, Lord James went to London. Oncemore my own master, I gave up all idea of further study; I had enoughlearning for my village, and in haste I returned thither. Once more Isat opposite to Eva in the little white house, as I had done two yearsbefore. But how greatly had intervening events increased her misfortune!We no longer dared talk of the future, that unknown moment of which weall have so great need, and without which our present joys appear toofeeble, and our misfortunes too great."Never did I witness grief nobler in its simplicity, calmer in itsintensity, than that of Eva Meredith. She forgot not to pray to the Godwho chastened her. For her, God was the being in whose hands are thesprings of hope, when earthly hopes are extinct. Her look of faithremained fixed upon her child's brow, as if awaiting the arrival of thesoul her prayers invoked. I cannot describe the courageous patience ofthat mother speaking to her son, who listened without understanding. Icannot tell you all the treasures of love, of thought, of ingeniousnarrative she displayed before that torpid intelligence, which repeated,like an echo, the last of her gentle words. She explained to him heaven,God, the angels; she endeavoured to make him pray, and joined his hands,but she could not make him raise his eyes to heaven. In all possibleshapes she tried to give him the first lessons of childhood; she readto him, spoke to him, placed pictures before his eyes--had recourse tomusic as a substitute for words. One day making a terrible effort, shetold William the story of his father's death; she hoped, expected atear. The child fell asleep whilst yet she spoke: tears were shed, butthey fell from the eyes of Eva Meredith."Thus did she exhaust herself by vain efforts, by a perseveringstruggle. That she might not cease to hope, she continued to toil; butto William's eyes pictures were merely colours; to his ears words werebut noise. The child, however, grew in stature and in beauty. One whohad seen him but for an instant would have taken the immobility of hiscountenance for placidity. But that prolonged and continued calm, thatabsence of all grief, of all tears, had a strange and sad effect uponus. Suffering must indeed be inherent in our nature, since William'seternal smile made every one say, 'The poor idiot!' Mothers know notthe happiness concealed in the tears of their child. A tear is a regret,a desire, a fear; it is life, in short, which begins to be understood.Alas! William was content with everything. All day long he seemed tosleep with his eyes open; anger, weariness, impatience, were alikeunknown to him. He had but one instinct: he knew his mother--he evenloved her. He took pleasure in resting on her knees, on her shoulder; hekissed her. When I kept him long away from her, he manifested a sort ofanxiety. I took him back to his mother; he showed no joy, but he wasagain tranquil. This tenderness, this faint glimmering of William'sheart, was Eva's life. It gave her strength to strive, to hope, to wait.If her words were not understood, at least her kisses were! How oftenshe took her son's head in her hands and kissed his forehead, as longand fervently as if she hoped her love would warm and vivify his frozensoul! How often did she dream a miracle whilst clasping her son in herarms, and pressing his still heart to her burning bosom! Often shelingered at night in the village church. (Eva Meredith was of a RomanCatholic family.) Kneeling upon the cold stone before the Virgin'saltar, she invoked the marble statue of Mary, holding her child in herarms, 'O virgin!' she said, 'my boy is inanimate as that image of thySon! Ask of God a soul for my child!'"She was charitable to all the poor children of the village, giving thembread and clothes, and saying to them, 'Pray for him.' She consoledafflicted mothers, in the secret hope that consolation would come atlast to her. She dried the tears of others, to enjoy the belief that oneday she also should cease to weep. In all the country round, she wasloved, blessed, venerated. She knew it, and she offered up to Heaven,not with pride but with hope, the blessings of the unfortunate inexchange for the recovery of her son. She loved to watch William'ssleep; then he was handsome and like other children. For an instant, fora second perhaps, she forgot; and whilst contemplating those regularfeatures, those golden locks, those long lashes which threw their shadowon his rose-tinted cheek, she felt a mother's joy, almost a mother'spride. God has moments of mercy even for those He has condemned tosuffer."Thus passed the first years of William's childhood. He attained the ageof eight years. Then a sad change, which could not escape my attentiveobservation, occurred in Eva Meredith. Either that her son's growth madehis want of intelligence more striking, or that she was like a workmanwho has laboured all day, and sinks at eve beneath the load of toil, Evaceased to hope; her soul seemed to abandon the task undertaken, and torecoil with weariness upon itself, asking only resignation. She laidaside the books, the engravings, the music, all the means, in short,that she had called to her aid; she grew silent and desponding; only, ifthat were possible, she was more affectionate than ever to her son. Asshe lost hope in his cure, she felt the more strongly that her child hadbut her in the world; and she asked a miracle of her heart--an increaseof the love she bore him. She became her son's servant--his slave; herwhole thoughts were concentrated in his wellbeing. If she felt cold, shesought a warmer covering for William; was she hungry, it was forWilliam she gathered the fruits of her garden; did she suffer fromfatigue, for him she selected the easiest chair and the softestcushions; she attended to her own sensations only to guess those of herson. She still displayed activity, though she no longer harboured hope."When William was eleven years old, the last phase of Eva Meredith'sexistence began. Remarkably tall and strong for his age, he ceased toneed that hourly care required by early childhood: he was no longer theinfant sleeping on his mother's knees; he walked alone in the garden; herode on horseback with me, and accompanied me in my distant visits; inshort, the bird, although wingless, left the nest. His misfortune wasin no way shocking or painful to behold. He was of exceeding beauty,silent, unnaturally calm--his eyes expressing nothing but repose: he wasnot awkward, or disagreeable, or importunate: it was a mind sleepingbeside yours, asking no question, making no reply. The incessantmaternal care which had served to occupy Mrs Meredith, and to diverther mind from dwelling on her sorrows, became unnecessary, and sheresumed her seat at the window, whence she beheld the village and thechurch-steeple--at that same window where she had so long wept herhusband. Hope and occupation successively failed her, and nothing wasleft her but to wait and watch, by day and by night, like the lamp thatever burns beneath cathedral vaults."But her forces were exhausted. In the midst of this grief which hadreturned to its starting-point, to silence and immobility, after havingin vain essayed exertion, courage, hope, Eva Meredith fell into adecline. In spite of all the resources of my art, I beheld her grow weakand thin. How apply a remedy, when the sickness is of the soul?"The poor foreigner! she needed her native sun and a little happiness towarm her; but the ray of sun and the ray of joy were alike wanting. Itwas long before she perceived her danger, because she thought not ofherself; but when at last she was unable to leave her arm-chair, shewas compelled to understand. I will not describe to you all her anguishat the thought of leaving William without a guide, without friend orprotector--of leaving him alone in the midst of strangers, he who neededto be cherished and led by the hand like a child. Oh, how she struggledfor life! with what avidity she swallowed the potions I prepared! howmany times she tried to believe in a cure, whilst all the time thedisease progressed! Then she kept William more at home,--she could nolonger bear to lose sight of him."'Remain with me,' she said; and William, always content near hismother, seated himself at her feet. She looked at him long, until aflood of tears prevented her distinguishing his gentle countenance;then she drew him still nearer to her, and pressed him to her heart.'Oh!' she exclaimed, in a kind of delirium, 'if my soul, on leaving mybody, might become the soul of my child, how happy should I be to die!'No sufferings could make her wholly despair of divine mercy, and whenall human possibility disappeared, this loving heart had gentle dreamsout of which it reconstructed hopes. But how sad it was, alas! to seethe poor mother slowly perishing before the eyes of her son, of a sonwho understood not death, and who smiled when she embraced him."'He will not regret me,' she said: 'he will not weep: he will notremember.' And she remained motionless, in mute contemplation of herchild. Her hand then sometimes sought mine: 'You love him, dear doctor?'she murmured."'I will never quit him,' replied I, 'so long as he has no betterfriends than myself.' God in heaven, and the poor village doctorupon earth, were the two guardians to whom she confided her son."Faith is a great thing! This woman, widowed, disinherited, dying, anidiot child at her side, was yet saved from that utter despair whichbrings blasphemy to the lips of death. An invisible friend was near her,on whom she seemed to rest, listening sometimes to holy words, which shealone could hear."One morning she sent for me early. She had been unable to get up. Withher wan, transparent hand she showed me a sheet of paper on which a fewlines were written."'Doctor,' she said, in her gentlest tones, 'I have not strength tocontinue; finish this letter!'"I read as follows:--     "'My Lord,--I write to you for the last time. Whilst health is     restored to your old age, I suffer and am about to die. I leave     your grandson, William Kysington, without a protector. My Lord,     this last letter is to recall him to your memory; I ask for him a     place in your heart rather than a share of your fortune. Of all the     things of this world, he has understood but one--his mother's love;     and now she must leave him for ever! Love him, my Lord,--love is     the only sentiment he can comprehend.'"She could write no more. I added:--     "'Mrs William Kysington has but few days to live. What are Lord     James Kysington's orders with respect to the child who bears his     name?'"This letter was sent to London, and we waited. Eva kept her bed.William, seated near her, held her hand in his: his mother smiled sadlyupon him, whilst I, at the other side of the bed, prepared potions toassuage her pains. Again she began to talk to her son, as if no longerdespairing that, after her death, some of her words might recur to hismemory. She gave the child all the advice, all the instructions shewould have given to an intelligent being. Then she turned to me--'Whoknows, doctor,' she said, 'one day, perhaps, he will find my words atthe bottom of his heart!'"Three more weeks elapsed. Death approached, and submissive as was theChristian soul of Eva, she yet felt the anguish of separation and thesolemn awe of the future. The village priest came to see her, and whenhe left her I met him and took his hand."'You will pray for her,' I said."'I have entreated _her_ to pray for _me_!' was his reply."It was Eva Meredith's last day. The sun had set: the window, near whichshe so long had sat, was open: she could see from her bed the landscapeshe had loved. She held her son in her arms and kissed his face andhair, weeping sadly. 'Poor child! what will become of you? Oh!' shesaid, with tender earnestness, 'listen to me, William:--I am dying!Your father is dead also; you are alone; you must pray to the Lord. Ibequeath you to Him who watches over the sparrow upon the house-top; Hewill shield the orphan. Dear child, look at me! listen to me! Try tounderstand that I die, that one day you may remember me!' And the poormother, unable to speak longer, still found strength to embrace herchild."At that moment an unaccustomed noise reached my ears. The wheels of acarriage grated upon the gravel of the garden drive. I ran to the door.Lord James Kysington and Lady Mary entered the house."'I got your letter,' said Lord James. 'I was setting out for Italy, andit was not much off my road to come myself and settle the future destinyof William Meredith: so here I am. Mrs William----?'"'Mrs William Kysington still lives, my lord,' I replied."It was with a painful sensation that I saw this calm, cold, austereman approach Eva's chamber, followed by the haughty woman who came towitness what for her was a happy event--the death of her former rival!They entered the modest little room, so different from the sumptuousapartments of their Montpellier hotel. They drew near the bed, beneathwhose white curtains Eva, pale but still beautiful, held her son uponher heart. They stood, one on the right, the other on the left of thatcouch of suffering, without finding a word of affection to console thepoor woman who looked up at them. They barely gave utterance to a fewformal and unmeaning phrases. Averting their eyes from the painfulspectacle of death, and persuading themselves that Eva Meredith neithersaw nor heard, they passively awaited her spirit's departure--theircountenances not even feigning an expression of condolence or regret.Eva fixed her dying gaze upon them, and sudden terror seized the heartwhich had almost ceased to throb. She comprehended, for the first time,the secret sentiments of Lady Mary, the profound indifference andegotism of Lord James; she understood at last that they were enemiesrather than protectors of her son. Despair and terror portrayedthemselves on her pallid face. She made no attempt to soften thosesoulless beings. By a convulsive movement she drew William still closerto her heart, and, collecting her last strength--"'My child, my poor child!' she cried, 'you have no support upon earth;but God above is good. My God! succour my child!'"With this cry of love, with this supreme prayer, she breathed out herlife: her arms opened, her lips were motionless on William's cheek.Since she no longer embraced her son, there could be no doubt she wasdead--dead before the eyes of those who to the very last had refused tocomfort her affliction--dead without giving Lady Mary the uneasiness ofhearing her plead the cause of her son--dead, leaving her a complete anddecided victory."There was a moment of solemn silence: none moved or spoke. Death makesan impression upon the haughtiest. Lady Mary and Lord James Kysingtonkneeled beside their victim's bed. In a few minutes Lord James arose.'Take the child from his mother's room,' he said, 'and come with me,doctor; I will explain to you my intentions respecting him.'"For two hours William had been resting on the shoulder of Eva Meredith,his heart against her heart, his lips pressed to hers, receiving herkisses and her tears. I approached him, and, without expending uselesswords, I endeavoured to raise and lead him from the room; but heresisted, and his arms clasped his mother more closely. This resistance,the first the poor child had ever offered to living creature, touched myvery soul. On my renewing the attempt, however, William yielded; he madea movement and turned towards me, and I saw his beautiful countenancesuffused with tears. Until that day, William had never wept. I wasgreatly startled and moved, and I let the child throw himself again uponhis mother's corpse."'Take him away,' said Lord James."'My lord,' I exclaimed, 'he weeps! Ah, check not his tears!'"I bent over the child, and heard him sob."'William! dear William!' I cried, anxiously taking his hand, 'why doyou weep, William?'"For the second time he turned his head towards me; then, with a gentlelook, full of sorrow, 'My mother is dead,' he replied."I have not words to tell you what I felt. William's eyes were nowintelligent: his tears were sad and significant; and his voice wasbroken as when the heart suffers. I uttered a cry; I almost knelt downbeside Eva's bed."'Ah! you were right, Eva!' I exclaimed, 'not to despair of the mercyof God!'"Lord James himself had started. Lady Mary was as pale as Eva."'Mother! mother!' cried William, in tones that filled my heart withjoy; and then, repeating the words of Eva Meredith--those words whichshe had so truly said he would find at the bottom of his heart--thechild exclaimed aloud,"'I am dying, my son. Your father is dead; you are alone upon the earth;you must pray to the Lord!'"I pressed gently with my hand upon William's shoulder; he obeyed theimpulse, knelt down, joined his trembling hands--this time it was of hisown accord--and, raising to heaven a look full of life and feeling: 'MyGod! have pity on me!' he murmured."I took Eva's cold hand. 'Oh mother! mother of many sorrows!' Iexclaimed, 'can you hear your child? do you behold him from above? Behappy! your son is saved!'"Dead at Lady Mary's feet, Eva made her rival tremble; for it was not Iwho led William from the room, it was Lord James Kysington who carriedout his grandson in his arms."I have little to add, ladies. William recovered his reason and departedwith Lord James. Reinstated in his rights, he was subsequently hisgrandfather's sole heir. Science has recorded a few rare instances ofintelligence revived by a violent moral shock. Thus does the fact I haverelated find a natural explanation. But the simple women of the village,who had attended Eva Meredith during her illness, and had heard herfervent prayers, were convinced that, even as she had asked of Heaven,the soul of the mother had passed into the body of the child."'She was so good,' said they, 'that God could refuse her nothing.' Thisartless belief took firm root in the country. No one mourned MrsMeredith as dead."'She still lives,' said the people of the hamlet: 'speak to her son,and she will answer you.'"And when Lord William Kysington, in possession of his grandfather'sproperty, sent each year abundant alms to the village that had witnessedhis birth and his mother's death, the poor folks exclaimed--'There isMrs Meredith's kind soul thinking of us still! Ah, when she goes toheaven, it will be great pity for poor people!'"We do not strew flowers upon her tomb, but upon the steps of the altarof the Virgin, where she so often prayed to Mary to send a soul to herson. When bearing thither their wreaths of wild blossoms, the villagerssay to each other--'When she prayed so fervently, the good Virginanswered her softly: "I will give thy soul to thy child!"'"The _cure_ has suffered our peasants to retain this touchingsuperstition; and I myself, when Lord William came to see me, when hefixed upon me his eyes, so like his mother's--when his voice, whichhad a well-known accent, said, as Mrs Meredith was wont to say, 'DearDoctor, I thank you!' Then--smile, ladies, if you will--I wept, and Ibelieved, like all the village, that Eva Meredith was before me."She, whose existence was but a long series of sorrows, has left behindher a sweet, consoling memory, which has nothing painful for those wholoved her."In thinking of her we think of the mercy of God, and those who havehope in their hearts, hope with the greater confidence."But it is very late, ladies--your carriages are at the door. Pardonthis long story: at my age it is difficult to be concise in speaking ofthe events of one's youth. Forgive the old man for having made you smilewhen he arrived, and weep before he departed."These last words were spoken in the kindest and most paternal tone,whilst a half-smile glided across Dr Barnaby's lips. All his auditorsnow crowded round him, eager to express their thanks. But Dr Barnabygot up, made straight for his riding-coat of brown taffety, which hungacross a chair back, and, whilst one of the young men helped him to putit on--"Farewell, gentlemen; farewell, ladies," said the village doctor."My chaise is ready; it is dark, the road is bad; good-night: I must begone."When Dr Barnaby was installed in his cabriolet of green wicker-work, andthe little grey cob, tickled by the whip, was about to set off, Madamede Moncar stepped quickly forward, and leaning towards the doctor,whilst she placed one foot on the step of his vehicle, she said, in alow voice--"Doctor, I make you a present of the white cottage, and I will have itfitted up as it was when you loved Eva Meredith!"Then she ran back into the house. The carriages and the green chaisedeparted in different directions.A SINGULAR LETTER FROM SOUTHERN AFRICACOMMUNICATED BY MR HOGG, THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.[_MAGA._ NOVEMBER 1829.]My dear friend,--In my last I related to you all the circumstances ofour settlement here, and the prospect that we had of a peaceful andpleasant habitation. In truth, it is a fine country, and inhabited by afine race of people, for the Kousies, as far as I have seen of them, area simple and ingenuous race, and Captain Johnstone having insured thefriendship and protection of their chief, we lived in the most perfectharmony with them, trafficking with them for oxen, for which we gavethem iron and copper in exchange, the former being held in highestimation by them. But alas! sir, such a fate has befallen to me sinceI wrote you last, as I am sure never fell to the lot of a human being.And I am now going to relate to you one of those stories which, were itto occur in a romance, would be reckoned quite out of nature, and beyondall bounds of probability, so true is it that there are many things inheaven and earth that are not dreamed of in our philosophy.You knew my Agnes from her childhood--you were at our wedding atBeattock, and cannot but remember what an amiable and lovely girl shethen was. I thought so, and so did you--at least you said you never hadas bonny a bride on your knee. But you will hardly believe that herbeauty was then nothing in comparison with what it became afterwards;and when she was going about our new settlement with our little boy inher arms, I have often fancied that I never saw as lovely a human being.Be that as it may, the chief Karoo came to me one day with hisinterpreter, whom he caused to make a long palaver about his power, anddominion, and virtues, and his great desire to do much good. Thelanguage of this fellow being a mixture of Kaffre, High Dutch, andEnglish, was peculiarly ludicrous, and most of all so when he concludedwith expressing his lord's desire to have my wife to be his own, and togive me in exchange for her four oxen, the best that I could choose fromhis herd!As he made the proposal in presence of my wife, she was so much tickledwith the absurdity of the proposed barter, and the manner in which itwas expressed, that she laughed immoderately. Karoo, thinking she wasdelighted with it, eyed her with a look that surpasses all description,and then caused his interpreter make another palaver to her concerningall the good things she was to enjoy, one of which was, that she was toride upon an ox whose horns were tipped with gold. I thanked the greatKaroo for his kind intentions, but declared my incapability to part withmy wife, for that we were one flesh and blood, and nothing couldseparate us but death. He could comprehend no such tie as this. All mensold their wives and daughters as they listed, I was told,--for that thewomen were the sole property of the men. He had bought many women fromthe Tambookies, that were virgins, and had never given above two cowsfor any of them; and because he desired to have my wife, he had offeredme as much for her as would purchase four of the best wives in all thetwo countries, and that therefore I was bound to give her up to him. Andwhen I told him finally that nothing on earth could induce me to partwith her, he seemed offended, bit his thumb, knitted his brows, andstudied long in silence, always casting glances at Agnes of great pathosand languishment, which were perfectly irresistible, and ultimately hestruck his spear's head in the ground, and offered me ten cows and abull for my wife, and a choice virgin to boot. When this proffer waslikewise declined, he smiled in derision, telling me I was the son offoolishness, and that _he foretold I should repent it_. Three times hewent over this, and then went away in high dudgeon. Will you, sir,believe, or will any person alive believe, that it was possible I couldlive to repent this?My William was at this time about eleven months old, but was still atthe breast, as I could never prevail on his lovely mother to wean him;and at the very time of which I am speaking, our little settlementwas invaded one night by a tribe of those large baboons calledourang-outangs, pongos, or wild men of the woods, who did great mischiefto our fruits, yams, and carrots. From that time we kept a great numberof guns loaded, and set a watch; and at length the depredators wereagain discovered. We sallied out upon them in a body, not without alarm,for they are powerful and vindictive animals, and our guns were onlyloaded with common shot. They fled at the first sight of us, and thatwith such swiftness that we might as well have tried to catch deers, butwe got one close fire at them, and doubtless wounded a number of them,as their course was traced with blood. We pursued them as far as theKeys river, which they swam, and we lost them.Among all the depredators, there was none fell but one youngling, whichI lifted in my arms, when it looked so pitifully, and cried so like achild, that my heart bled for it. A large monster, more than six feethigh, perceiving that he had lost his cub, returned brandishing a hugeclub, and grinning at me. I wanted to restore the abominable brat, forI could not bear the thought of killing it, it was so like a humancreature; but before I could do this, several shots had been fired by mycompanions at the hideous monster, which caused him once more to take tohis heels; but turning oft as he fled, he made threatening gestures atme. A Kousi servant that we had, finished the cub, and I caused it to beburied.The very morning after that but one, Agnes and her black maid weremilking our few cows upon the green: I was in the garden, and Williamwas toddling about pulling flowers, when, all at once, the women werealarmed by the sight of a tremendous ourang-outang issuing from ourhouse, which they had just left. They seem to have been struck dumb andsenseless with amazement, for not one of them uttered a sound, until themonster, springing forward in one moment, snatched up the child and madeoff with him. Instead of coming to me, the women pursued the animal withthe child, not knowing, I believe, what they were doing. The fearfulshrieks which they uttered alarmed me, and I ran to the milking-green,thinking the cows had fallen on the women, as the cattle of thatdistrict are ticklish for pushing when any way hurt or irritated. BeforeI reached the green where the cows stood, the ourang-outang was fullyhalf a mile gone, and only the poor feeble exhausted women runningscreaming after him. For a good while I could not conceive what was thematter, but having my spade in my hand I followed spontaneously in thesame direction. Before I overtook the women, I heard the agonisedcries of my dear boy, my darling William, in the paws of that horriblemonster. There is no sensation of which the human heart is capable thatcan at all be compared with the horror which at that dreadful momentseized on mine. My sinews lost their tension, and my whole frame becamelax and powerless. I believe I ran faster than usual, but then I fellevery minute, and as I passed Agnes she fell into a fit. Kela-kal, theblack girl, with an astonishing presence of mind, had gone off at atangent, without orders, or without being once missed, to warn the restof the settlers, which she did with all expedition. I pursued on,breathless, and altogether unnerved with agony; but, alas! I rather lostthan gained ground.I think if I had been fairly started, that through desperation I couldhave overtaken the monster, but the hopelessness of success rendered mefeeble. The truth is, that he did not make great speed, not nearly thespeed these animals are wont to make, for he was greatly encumberedwith the child. You perhaps do not understand the nature of theseanimals--neither do I: but they have this peculiarity, that when theyare walking leisurely or running down-hill, they walk upright like ahuman being; but when hard pressed on level ground, or up-hill, they usetheir long arms as fore-legs, and then run with inconceivable swiftness.When flying with their own young, the greater part of them will runnearly twice as fast as an ordinary man, for the cubs cling to them withboth feet and hands, but as my poor William shrunk from the monster'stouch, he was obliged to embrace him closely with one paw, and run onthree, and still in that manner he outran me. O may never earthly parentbe engaged in such a heartrending pursuit! Keeping still his distancebefore me, he reached the Keys river, and there the last gleam of hopeclosed on me, for I could not swim, while the ourang-outang, with muchacuteness, threw the child across his shoulders, held him by the feetwith one paw, and with the other three stemmed the river, though thenin flood, with amazing rapidity. It was at this dreadful moment that mybeloved babe got his eyes on me as I ran across the plain towards him,and I saw him holding up his little hands in the midst of the foamingflood, and crying out, "Pa! pa! pa!" which he seemed to utter with asort of desperate joy at seeing me approach.Alas! that sight was the last, for in two minutes thereafter the monstervanished, with my dear child, in the jungles and woods beyond the river,and then my course was stayed, for to have thrown myself in, would onlyhave been committing suicide, and leaving a destitute widow in a foreignland. I had therefore no other resource but to throw myself down, andpour out my soul in lamentation and prayer to God. From this state ofhapless misery I was quickly aroused by the sight of twelve of mycountrymen coming full speed across the plain on my track. They wereall armed and stripped for the pursuit, and four of them, some of whomyou know--Adam Johnstone, Adam Haliday, Peter Carruthers, and JosephNicholson--being excellent swimmers, plunged at once into the river andswam across, though not without both difficulty and danger, and withoutloss of time continued the pursuit.The remainder of us, nine in number, were obliged to go half a day'sjourney up the river, to a place called Shekah, where the Tambookiesdragged us over on a hurdle; and we there procured a Kousi, who had ahound, which he pretended could follow the track of an ourang-outangover the whole world. Urged on by a sort of forlorn and desperate hope,we kept at a running pace the whole afternoon; and at the fall of nightcame up with Peter Carruthers, who had lost the other three. A singularadventure had befallen to himself. He and his companions had agreed tokeep within call of each other; but as he advanced, he conceived heheard the voice of a child crying behind him to the right, on which heturned off in that direction, but heard no more of the wail. As he wassearching, however, he perceived an ourang-outang steal from a thicket,which, nevertheless, it seemed loth to leave. When he pursued it, itfled slowly, as with intent to entice him in pursuit from the spot; butwhen he turned towards the thicket, it immediately followed. Peter wasarmed with a pistol and rapier; but his pistol and powder had beenrendered useless by swimming the river, and he had nothing to depend onbut his rapier. The creature at first was afraid of the pistol, and keptaloof; but seeing no fire issue from it, it came nigher and nigher, andseemed determined to have a scuffle with Carruthers for the possessionof the thicket. At length it shook its head, grinning with disdain, andmotioned him to fling the pistol away as of no use; it then went andbrought two great clubs, of which it gave him the choice, to fight withit. There was something so bold, and at the same time so generous, inthis, that Peter took one as if apparently accepting the challenge; butthat moment he pulled out his gleaming rapier, and ran at the hideousbrute, which frightened it so much that it uttered two or three loudgrunts like a hog, and scampered off; but soon turning, it threw theclub at Peter with such a certain aim that it had very nigh killed him.He saw no more of the animal that night; but when we found Carruthers,he was still lingering about the spot, persuaded that my child wasthere, and that, if in life, he would soon hear his cries. We watchedthe thicket all night, and at the very darkest hour, judge of mytrepidation when I heard the cries of a child in the thicket, almostclose by me, and well could distinguish that the cries proceeded fromthe mouth of my own dear William--from that sweet and comely mouth whichI had often kissed a hundred times in a day. We all rushed spontaneouslyinto the thicket, and all towards the same point; but, strange torelate, we only ran against one another, and found nothing besides. Icried on my boy's name, but all was again silent, and we heard no more.He only uttered three cries, and then we all heard distinctly that hiscrying was stopped by something stuffed into his mouth. I still wonderhow I retained my reason, for certainly no parent had ever such a trialto undergo. Before day, we heard some movement in the thicket, andthough heard by us all at the same time, each of us took it for one ofour companions moving about; and it was not till long after the sun wasup, that we at length discovered a bed up among the thick branches of atree, and not above twelve feet from the ground; but the occupants hadescaped, and no doubt remained but that they were now far beyond ourreach. This was the most grievous and heartbreaking miss of all; and Icould not help giving vent to my grief in excessive weeping, while allmy companions were deeply affected with my overpowering sorrow.We then tried the dog, and by him we learned the way the fliers hadtaken; but that was all, for as the day grew warm, he lost all traceswhatever. We searched over all the country for many days, but couldfind no traces of my dear boy, either dead or alive; and at length wereobliged to return home weary and broken-hearted. To describe the stateof my poor Agnes is impossible. It may be conceived, but can never beexpressed. But I must haste on with my narrative, for I have yet a greatdeal to communicate.About three months after this sad calamity, one evening, on returninghome from my labour, my Agnes was missing, and neither her maid-servant,nor one of all the settlers, could give the least account of her. Mysuspicions fell instantly on the Kousi chief, Karoo, for I knew thathe had been in our vicinity hunting, and remembered his threat. Thiswas the most grievous stroke of all, and in order to do all for thepreservation of my dear wife that lay in my power, I and three of mycompanions set out and travelled night and day till we came to thechief's headquarters. I have not time to describe all the fooleriesand difficulties we had to encounter; suffice it, that Karoo deniedthe deed, but still in such a manner that my suspicions were confirmed.I threatened him terribly with the vengeance of his friend CaptainJohnstone, and the English army at the Cape, saying I would burn himand all his wives and his people with fire. He wept out of fear andvexation, and offered me the choice of his wives, or any two of them,showing me a great number of them, many of whom he recommended for theirgreat beauty and fatness; and I believe he would have given me anynumber if I would have gone away satisfied. But the language of theinterpreter being in a great measure unintelligible, we all deemed thathe said repeatedly that Karoo _would not give the lady up_.What was I now to do? We had not force in our own small settlementto compel Karoo to restore her; and I was therefore obliged to buy atrained ox, on which I rode all the way to the next British settlement,for there are no horses in that country. There I found Captain Johnstonewith three companies of the 72d, watching the inroads of the savageBoshesmen. He was greatly irritated at Karoo, and despatched LieutenantM'Kenzie and fifty men along with me to chastise the aggressor. Whenthe chief saw the Highlanders, he was terrified out of his wits; butnevertheless, not knowing what else to do, he prepared for resistance,after once more proffering me the choice of his wives.Just when we were on the eve of commencing a war, which must have beenruinous to our settlement, a black servant of Adam Johnstone's came tome, and said that I ought not to fight and kill his good chief, for thathe had not the white woman. I was astonished, and asked the Kaffre whathe meant, when he told me that he himself saw my wife carried across theriver by a band of pongos (ourang-outangs), but he had always kept it asecret, for fear of giving me distress, as they were too far gone forpursuit when he beheld them. He said they had her bound, and werecarrying her gently on their arms, but she was either dead or in aswoon, for she was not crying, and her long hair was hanging down.I had kept up under every calamity till then, but these news fairlyupset my reason. I fell a-blaspheming, and accused the Almighty ofinjustice for laying such fearful judgments on me. May He in mercyforgive me, for I knew not what I said; but had I not been deprivedof reason I could not have outlived such a catastrophe as this; andwhenever it recurs to my remembrance, it will make my blood run chilltill the day of my death. A whole year passed over my head like oneconfused dream; another came, and during the greater part of it my mindwas very unsettled; but at length I began to indulge in long fits ofweeping, till by degrees I awakened to a full sense of all my misery,and often exclaimed that there was no sorrow like my sorrow. I lingeredon about the settlement, not having power to leave the spot where I hadonce been so happy with those I loved, and all my companions joined inthe cultivation of my fields and garden, in hopes that I would becomeresigned to the will of the Lord and the judgments of His providence.About the beginning of last year a strange piece of intelligence reachedour settlement. It was said that two maids of Kamboo had been out on themountains of Norroweldt gathering fruits, where they had seen a pongotaller than any Kousi, and that this pongo had a beautiful white boywith him, for whom he was gathering the choicest fruits, and the boy wasgambolling and playing around him, and leaping on his shoulders.This was a piece of intelligence so extraordinary, and so much out ofthe common course of events, that every one of the settlers agreed thatit could not be a forgery, and that it behoved us immediately to lookafter it. We applied to Karoo for assistance, who had a great number ofslaves from that country, much attached to him, who knew the language ofthe place whither we were going, and all the passes of the country. Hecomplied readily with our request, giving us an able and intelligentguide, with as many of his people as we chose. We raised in all fiftyMalays and Kousies; nine British soldiers, and every one of the settlersthat could bear arms, went with us, so that we had in all nearly ahundred men, the blacks being armed with pikes, and all the rest withswords, guns, and pistols. We journeyed for a whole week, travellingmuch by night, and resting in the shade by day, and at last we came tothe secluded district of which we were in search, and in which we founda temporary village, or camp, of one of these independent inland tribes.They were in great alarm at our approach, and were apparently preparingfor a vigorous resistance; but on our guide going up to them, who wasone of their own tribe, and explaining our views, they received usjoyfully, and proffered their assistance.From this people we got the heart-stirring intelligence, that a wholecolony of pongos had taken possession of that country, and would soon bemasters of it all; for that the Great Spirit had sent them a queen fromthe country beyond the sun, to teach them to speak, and work, and go towar; and that she had the entire power over them, and would not sufferthem to hurt any person who did not offer offence to them; that theyknew all she said to them, and answered her, and lived in houses andkindled fires like other people, and likewise fought rank and file. Thatthey had taken one of the maidens of their own tribe to wait upon thequeen's child; but because the girl wept, the queen caused them to sether at liberty.I was now rent between hope and terror--hope that this was my own wifeand child, and terror that they would be rent in pieces by the savagemonsters rather than given up. Of this last, the Lockos (the name ofthis wandering tribe) assured us, we needed not to entertain anyapprehensions, for that they would, every one of them, die rather thanwrong a hair of their queen's head. But that it behoved us instantlyto surround them; for if they once came to understand that we were inpursuit, they would make their escape, and then the whole world wouldnot turn or detain them.Accordingly, that very night, being joined by the Lockos, we surroundedthe colony by an extensive circle, and continuing to close as weadvanced. By the break of day we had them closely surrounded. Themonsters flew to arms at the word of command, nothing daunted, forminga close circle round their camp and queen, the strongest of the malesbeing placed outermost, and the females inmost, but all armed alike, andall having the same demure and melancholy faces. The circle being soclose that I could not see inside, I went with the nine red-coats to thetop of a cliff that in some degree overlooked the encampment, in orderthat, if my Agnes really was there, she might understand who was nearher. Still I could not discover what was within, but I called her namealoud several times, and in about five minutes after that, the wholecircle of tremendous brutal warriors flung away their arms and retiredbackward, leaving an open space for me to approach their queen.In the most dreadful trepidation I entered between the hideous files,being well guarded by soldiers on either hand, and followed by the restof the settlers; and there I indeed beheld my wife, my beloved Agnes,standing ready to receive me, with little William in her right hand, anda beautiful chubby daughter in her left, about two years old, and thevery image of her mother. Conceive, if you can, sir, such a meeting!Were there ever a husband and wife met in such circumstances before?Never since the creation of the world! The two children looked healthyand beautiful, with their fur aprons, but it struck me at first that mybeloved was much altered: it was only, however, caused by her internalcommotion, by feelings which overpowered her grateful heart, againstwhich nature could not bear up, for on my first embrace she fainted inmy arms, which kept us all in suspension and confusion for a long space.The children fled from us, crying for their mother, and took shelterwith their friends the pongos, who seemed in great amazement, and partof them began to withdraw as if to hide themselves.As soon as Agnes was somewhat restored, I proposed that we shouldwithdraw from the camp of her savage colony; but she refused, and toldme that she behoved to part with her protectors on good terms, and thatshe must depart without any appearance of compulsion, which they mightresent; and we actually rested ourselves during the heat of the day inthe shades erected by those savage inhabitants of the forest. My wifewent to her hoard of provisions, and distributed to every one of thepongos his share of fruit, succulent herbs, and roots, which they atewith great composure. It was a curious scene, something like what I hadseen in a menagerie; and there was my little William, serving out foodto the young ourang-outangs, cuffing them and ordering them, in thebroad Annandale dialect, to do this, that, and the other thing; andthey were not only obedient, but seemed flattered by his notice andcorrection. We were then presented with delicious fruits, but I had noheart to partake, being impatient to have my family away from the midstof this brutal society; for as long as we were there, I could notconceive them safe or fairly in my own power.Agnes then stood up and made a speech to her subjects, accompanying herexpressions with violent motions and contortions to make them understandher meaning. They understood it perfectly; for when they heard that sheand her children were to leave them, they set up such a jabbering oflamentation as British ears never heard. Many of them came cowering andfawning before her, and she laid her hand on their heads; many, too, ofthe young ones came running, and lifting the children's hands, they putthem on their own heads. We then formed a close circle round Agnes andthe children, to the exclusion of the pongos that still followed behind,howling and lamenting; and that night we lodged in the camp of theLockos, placing a triple guard round my family, of which there stoodgreat need. We durst not travel by night, but we contrived two coveredhurdles, in which we carried Agnes and the children, and for three daysa considerable body of the tallest and strongest of the ourang-outangsattended our steps, and some of them came to us fearlessly every day, asshe said, to see if she was well, and if we were not hurting her.We reached our own settlement one day sooner than we took in marchingeastward; but then I durst not remain for a night, but getting into avessel, I sailed straight for the Cape, having first made over all mygoods and chattels to my countrymen, who are to send me down value herein corn and fruit; and here I am, living with my Agnes and our twochildren, at a little wigwam about five miles from Cape Town.My Agnes's part of the story is the most extraordinary of all. But hereI must needs be concise, giving only a short and general outline ofher adventures; for among dumb animals, whose signals and grimaces wereso liable to misinterpretation, much must have been left to her ownconjecture. The creatures' motives for stealing and detaining herappeared to have been as follows:--These animals remain always in distinct tribes, and are perfectlysubordinate to a chief or ruler, and his secondary chiefs. For theirexpedition to rob our gardens, they had brought their sovereign's soleheir along with them, as they never leave any of the royal family behindthem, for fear of a surprisal. It was this royal cub which we killed,and the queen his mother having been distractedly inconsolable for theloss of her darling, the old monarch had set out by night to try ifpossible to recover it; and on not finding it, he seized on my boy inits place, carried him home in safety to his queen, and gave her him tonurse! She did so. Yes, she positively did nurse him at her breast forthree months, and never child throve better than he did. By that time hewas beginning to walk, and aim at speech, by imitating every voice heheard, whether of beast or bird; and it had struck the monsters as agreat loss that they had no means of teaching their young sovereign tospeak, at which art he seemed so apt. This led to the scheme of stealinghis own mother to be his instructor, which they effected in the mostmasterly style, binding and gagging her in her own house, and carryingher from a populous hamlet in the fair forenoon, without having beendiscovered. Their expertness, and the rapidity of their motions, Agnesdescribed as inconceivable by those who had never witnessed them. Theyshowed every sort of tenderness and kindness by the way, proffering herplenty of fruit and water; but she gave herself totally up to despair,till, behold! she was introduced to her own little William, plump,thriving, and as merry as a cricket, gambolling away among his brutalcompeers, for many of whom he had conceived a great affection,--but thenthey far outgrew him, while others as fast overtook him in size.Agnes immediately took her boy under her tuition, and was soon given tounderstand that her will was to be the sole law of the community; andall the while that they detained her, they never refused her in aughtsave to take her home again. Our little daughter she had named Beatrice,after her maternal grandmother. She was born six months and six daysafter Agnes's abstraction. She spoke highly of the pongos, of theirdocility, generosity, warmth of affection to their mates and young ones,and of their irresistible strength. She conceived that, however, to havebeen a tribe greatly superior to all others of the race, for she nevercould regard them in any other light than as dumb human creatures. Iconfess that I had the same sort of feeling while in their settlement,for many of the young females in particular were much comelier thannegro savages whom I have often seen, and they laughed, smiled, andcried very much like human creatures. At my wife's injunctions, or fromher example, they all wore aprons: and the females had let the hair oftheir heads grow long. It was glossy black, and neither curled norwoolly, and on the whole, I cannot help having a lingering affectionfor the creatures. They would make the most docile, powerful, andaffectionate of all slaves; but they come very soon to their growth, andare but shortlived, in that way approximating to the rest of the brutecreation. They live entirely on fruits, roots, and vegetables, and tasteno animal food whatever.I asked Agnes much of the civility of their manner to her, and shealways describes it as respectful and uniform. For a while she neverthought herself quite safe when near the queen, but the dislike of thelatter to her arose entirely out of her boundless affection for theboy. No mother could possibly be fonder of her own offspring than thisaffectionate creature was of William, and she was jealous of his motherfor taking him from her, and causing him instantly to be weaned. Butthen the chief never once left the two queens by themselves; they hadalways a guard day and night.I have no objection to the publication of these adventures in Britain,though I know they will not obtain credit; but I should not like thatthe incidents reached the "Sidney Gazette," as I intend emigrating tothat country as soon as I receive value for the stock I left at thesettlement, for I have a feeling that my family is scarcely safe aslong as I am on any part of the coast of Africa. And for the sake of myrising family, I have an aversion at its being known that they werebred among creatures that must still be conceived to be of the brutecreation. Do not write till you hear from me again; and believe me ever,your old affectionate friend,                         WM. MITCHELL.

A weaker man might easily have been ledto play the mere tyrant by the mad outburst of loyalty which greeted histriumph. On the very day when the crowd around Russell's scaffold weredipping their handkerchiefs in his blood as in the blood of a martyr theUniversity of Oxford solemnly declared that the doctrine of passiveobedience even to the worst of rulers was a part of religion. ButCharles saw that immense obstacles still lay in the road of a meretyranny. Ormond and the great Tory party which had rallied to hissuccour against the Exclusionists were still steady for parliamentaryand legal government. The Church was as powerful as ever, and themention of a renewal of the Indulgence to Nonconformists had to bewithdrawn before the opposition of the bishops. He was careful thereforeduring the few years which remained to him to avoid the appearance ofany open violation of public law. He suspended no statute. He imposed notax by Royal authority. Galling to the Crown as the freedom of the pressand the Habeas Corpus Act were soon found to be, Charles made no attemptto curtail the one or to infringe the other. But while cautious to avoidrousing popular resistance, he moved coolly and resolutely forward onthe path of despotism. It was in vain that Halifax pressed for energeticresistance to the aggressions of France, for the recall of Monmouth, orfor the calling of a fresh Parliament. Like every other Englishstatesman he found he had been duped. Now that his work was done he wassuffered to remain in office but left without any influence in thegovernment. Hyde, who was created Earl of Rochester, still remained atthe head of the Treasury; but Charles soon gave more of his confidenceto the supple and acute Sunderland, who atoned for his desertion of theking's cause in the heat of the Exclusion Bill by an acknowledgement ofhis error and a pledge of entire accordance with the king's will.[Sidenote: New Town Charters.]The protests both of Halifax and of Danby, who was now released from theTower, in favour of a return to Parliaments were treated withindifference, the provisions of the Triennial Act were disregarded, andthe Houses remained unassembled during the remainder of the king'sreign. His secret alliance with France furnished Charles with the fundshe immediately required, and the rapid growth of the customs through theincrease of English commerce promised to give him a revenue which, ifpeace were preserved, would save him from any further need of freshappeals to the Commons. Charles was too wise however to look uponParliaments as utterly at an end: and he used this respite to secure aHouse of Commons which should really be at his disposal. The strength ofthe Country party had been broken by its own dissensions over theExclusion Bill and by the flight or death of its more prominent leaders.Whatever strength it retained lay chiefly in the towns, whoserepresentation was for the most part virtually or directly in the handsof their corporations, and whose corporations, like the merchant classgenerally, were in sympathy Whig. The towns were now attacked by writsof "quo warranto," which called on them to show cause why their chartersshould not be declared forfeited on the ground of abuse of theirprivileges. A few verdicts on the side of the Crown brought about ageneral surrender of municipal liberties; and the grant of freshcharters, in which all but ultra-loyalists were carefully excluded fromtheir corporations, placed the representation of the boroughs in thehands of the Crown. Against active discontent Charles had long beenquietly providing by the gradual increase of his Guards. The withdrawalof its garrison from Tangier enabled him to raise their force to ninethousand well-equipped soldiers, and to supplement this force, thenucleus of our present standing army, by a reserve of six regimentswhich were maintained till they should be needed at home in the serviceof the United Provinces.[Sidenote: Death of Charles.]But great as the danger really was it lay not so much in isolated actsof tyranny as in the character and purpose of Charles himself, and hisdeath at the very moment of his triumph saved English freedom. He hadregained his old popularity; and at the news of his sickness in thespring of 1685 crowds thronged the churches, praying that God wouldraise him up again to be a father to his people. But while his subjectswere praying the one anxiety of the king was to die reconciled to theCatholic Church. His chamber was cleared, and a priest named Huddleston,who had saved his life after the battle of Worcester, received hisconfession and administered the last sacraments. Not a word of thisceremony was whispered when the nobles and bishops were recalled intothe royal presence, and Charles though steadily refusing the communionwhich Bishop Ken offered him accepted the bishop's absolution. All thechildren of his mistresses save Monmouth were gathered round the bed,and Charles commended them to his brother's protection by name. Thescene which followed is described by a chaplain to one of the prelateswho stood round the dying king. Charles "blessed all his children one byone, pulling them on to his bed; and then the bishops moved him, as hewas the Lord's anointed and the father of his country, to bless themalso and all that were there present, and in them the general body ofhis subjects. Whereupon, the room being full, all fell down upon theirknees, and he raised himself in his bed and very solemnly blessed themall." The strange comedy was at last over. Charles died as he had lived:brave, witty, cynical, even in the presence of death. Tortured as he waswith pain, he begged the bystanders to forgive him for being sounconscionable a time in dying. One mistress, the Duchess of Portsmouth,hung weeping over his bed. His last thought was of another mistress,Nell Gwynn. "Do not," he whispered to his successor ere he sank into afatal stupor, "do not let poor Nelly starve!"[Sidenote: James the Second.]The death of Charles in February 1685 placed his brother James, the Dukeof York, upon the throne. His character and policy were already wellknown. Of all the Stuart rulers James is the only one whose intellectwas below mediocrity. His mind was dull and narrow though orderly andmethodical; his temper dogged and arbitrary but sincere. His religiousand political tendencies had always been the same. He had alwayscherished an entire belief in the royal authority and a hatred ofParliaments. His main desire was for the establishment of Catholicism asthe only means of ensuring the obedience of his people; and his old loveof France was quickened by the firm reliance which he placed on the aidof Lewis in bringing about that establishment. But the secrecy in whichhis political action had as yet been shrouded and his long absence fromEngland had hindered any general knowledge of his designs. His firstwords on his accession, his promise to "preserve this Government both inChurch and State as it is now by law established," were welcomed by thewhole country with enthusiasm. All the suspicions of a Catholicsovereign seemed to have disappeared. "We have the word of a King!" ranthe general cry, "and of a King who was never worse than his word." Theconviction of his brother's faithlessness in fact stood James in goodstead. He was looked upon as narrow, impetuous, stubborn, and despoticin heart, but even his enemies did not accuse him of being false. Aboveall, incredible as such a belief may seem now, he was believed to bekeenly alive to the honour of his country and resolute to free it fromforeign dependence.[Sidenote: James and Parliament.]From the first indeed there were indications that James understood hisdeclaration in a different sense from the nation. He was resolved tomake no disguise of his own religion; the chapel in which he hadhitherto worshipped with closed doors was now thrown open and the kingseen at Mass. He regarded attacks on his faith as attacks on himself,and at once called on the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop ofLondon to hinder all preaching against Catholicism as a part of their"duty" to their king. He made no secret of his resolve to procurefreedom of worship for his co-religionists while still refusing it tothe rest of the Nonconformists, whom he hated as republicans andExclusionists. All was passed over however in the general confidence. Itwas necessary to summon a Parliament, for the royal revenue ceased withthe death of Charles; but the elections, swayed at once by the tide ofloyalty and by the command of the boroughs which the surrender of theircharters had given to the Crown, sent up in May a House of Commons inwhich James found few members who were not to his mind. His appointmentindeed of Catholic officers in the army was already exciting murmurs;but these were hushed as James repeated his pledge of maintaining theestablished order both in Church and State. The question of religioussecurity was waived at a hint of the royal displeasure, and a revenue ofnearly two millions was granted to the king for life.[Sidenote: Argyle's Rising.]All that was wanted to rouse the loyalty of the country into fanaticismwas supplied by a rebellion in the North, and by another under Monmouthin the West. The hopes of Scotch freedom had clung ever since theRestoration to the house of Argyle. The great Marquis indeed had beenbrought to the block at the king's return. His son, the Earl of Argyle,had been unable to save himself even by a life of singular caution andobedience from the ill-will of the vile politicians who governedScotland. He was at last convicted of treason in 1682 on grounds atwhich every English statesman stood aghast. "We should not hang a doghere," Halifax protested, "on the grounds on which my Lord Argyle hasbeen sentenced to death." The Earl escaped however to Holland, and livedpeaceably there during the last six years of the reign of Charles.Monmouth had found the same refuge at the Hague, where a belief in theking's love and purpose to recall him secured him a kindly receptionfrom William of Orange. But the accession of James was a death-blow tothe hopes of the Duke, while it stirred the fanaticism of Argyle to aresolve of wresting Scotland from the rule of a Catholic king. The twoleaders determined to appear in arms in England and the North, and thetwo expeditions sailed within a few days of each other. Argyle's attemptwas soon over. His clan of the Campbells rose on the Earl's landing inCantyre, but the country had been occupied for the king, and quarrelsamong the exiles who accompanied him robbed his effort of every chanceof success. His force scattered without a fight; and Argyle, arrestedin an attempt to escape, was hurried on the 30th of June to a traitor'sdeath.[Sidenote: Monmouth's Rising.]Monmouth for a time found brighter fortune. His popularity in the Westwas great, and though the gentry held aloof when he landed at Lyme anddemanded an effective parliamentary government as well as freedom ofworship for Protestant Nonconformists, the farmers and traders ofDevonshire and Dorset flocked to his standard. The clothier-towns ofSomerset were true to the Whig cause, as they had been true to the causeof the Long Parliament; and on the entrance of the Duke into Taunton thepopular enthusiasm showed itself in the flowers which wreathed everydoor, as well as in a train of young girls who presented Monmouth with aBible and a flag. His forces now amounted to six thousand men, butwhatever chance of success he might have had was lost by his assumptionof the title of king, his right to which he had pledged himself hithertoto leave for decision to a free Parliament. The two Houses offered tosupport James with their lives and fortunes, and passed a bill ofattainder against the Duke. The gentry, still true to the cause of Maryand of William, held stubbornly aloof; while the Guards and theregiments from Tangier hurried to the scene of the revolt and themilitia gathered to the royal standard. Foiled in an attempt on Bristoland Bath, Monmouth fell back on Bridgewater, and flung himself in thenight of the 6th of July on the king's forces as they lay encamped hardby on Sedgemoor. The surprise failed; and the brave peasants and minerswho followed the Duke, checked in their advance by a deep drain whichcrossed the moor, were broken after a short but desperate resistance bythe royal horse. Their leader fled from the field, and after a vaineffort to escape from the realm was captured and sent pitilessly to theblock.[Sidenote: The Bloody Circuit.]Never had England shown a firmer loyalty; but its loyalty was changedinto horror by the terrible measures of repression which followed on thevictory of Sedgemoor. Even North, the Lord Keeper, a servile tool of theCrown, protested against the license and bloodshed in which the troopswere suffered to indulge after the battle. His protest however wasdisregarded, and he withdrew broken-hearted from the Court to die. Jameswas in fact resolved on a far more terrible vengeance; and theChief-Justice Jeffreys, a man of great natural powers but of violenttemper, was sent to earn the Seals by a series of judicial murders whichhave left his name a byword for cruelty. Three hundred and fifty rebelswere hanged in what has ever since, been known as the "Bloody Circuit,"while Jeffreys made his way through Dorset and Somerset. More than eighthundred were sold into slavery beyond sea. A yet larger number werewhipped and imprisoned. The Queen, the maids of honour, the courtiers,even the Judge himself, made shameless profit from the sale of pardons.What roused pity above all were the cruelties wreaked upon women. Somewere scourged from market-town to market-town. Mrs. Lisle, the wife ofone of the Regicides, was sent to the block at Winchester for harbouringa rebel. Elizabeth Gaunt for the same act of womanly charity was burnedat Tyburn. Pity turned into horror when it was found that cruelty suchas this was avowed and sanctioned by the king. Even the cold heart ofGeneral Churchill, to whose energy the victory at Sedgemoor had mainlybeen owing, revolted at the ruthlessness with which James turned awayfrom all appeals for mercy. "This marble," he cried as he struck thechimney-piece on which he leant, "is not harder than the king's heart."[Sidenote: James and France.]But it was soon plain that the terror which this butchery was meant tostrike into the people was part of a larger purpose. The revolt was madea pretext for a vast increase of the standing army. Charles, as we haveseen, had silently and cautiously raised it to nearly ten thousand men;James raised it at one swoop to twenty thousand. The employment of thisforce was to be at home, not abroad, for the hope of an English policyin foreign affairs had already faded away. In the designs which Jameshad at heart he could look for no consent from Parliament; and howeverhis pride revolted against a dependence on France, it was only byFrench gold and French soldiers that he could hope to hold theParliament permanently at bay. A week therefore after his accession heassured Lewis that his gratitude and devotion to him equalled that ofCharles himself. "Tell your master," he said to the French ambassador,"that without his protection I can do nothing. He has a right to beconsulted, and it is my wish to consult him, about everything." Thepledge of subservience was rewarded with the promise of a subsidy, andthe promise was received with the strongest expressions of delight andservility. The hopes which the Prince of Orange had conceived from hisfather-in-law's more warlike temper were nipped by a refusal to allowhim to visit England. All the caution and reserve of Charles the Secondin his dealings with France was set aside. Sunderland, the favouriteMinister of the new king as he had been of the old, not only promisedduring the session to avoid the connection with Spain and Holland whichthe Parliament was known to desire, but "to throw aside the mask andopenly break with them as soon as the royal revenue is secured." Thesupport indeed which James needed was a far closer and firmer supportthan his brother had sought for. Lewis on the other hand trusted him ashe could never trust Charles. His own bigotry understood the bigotry ofthe new sovereign. "The confirmation of the King's authority and theestablishment of religion," he wrote, "are our common interest"; and hepromised that James should "find in his friendship all the resourceswhich he can expect."[Sidenote: Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.]Never had the secret league with France seemed so full of danger toEnglish religion. Europe had long been trembling at the ambition ofLewis; it was trembling now at his bigotry. He had proclaimed warfareagainst civil liberty in his attack upon Holland; he declared war atthis moment upon religious freedom by revoking the Edict of Nantes, themeasure by which Henry the Fourth after his abandonment of Protestantismsecured toleration and the free exercise of their worship for hisProtestant subjects. It had been respected by Richelieu even in hisvictory over the Huguenots, and only lightly tampered with by Mazarin.But from the beginning of his reign Lewis had resolved to set aside itsprovisions, and his revocation of it at the end of 1685 was only thenatural close of a progressive system of persecution. The revocation wasfollowed by outrages more cruel than even the bloodshed of Alva.Dragoons were quartered on Protestant families, women were flung fromtheir sick-beds into the streets, children were torn from their mothers'arms to be brought up in Catholicism, ministers were sent to thegalleys. In spite of the royal edicts which forbade even flight to thevictims of these horrible atrocities a hundred thousand Protestantsfled over the borders, and Holland, Switzerland, the Palatinate, werefilled with French exiles. Thousands found refuge in England, and theirindustry established in the fields east of London the silk trade ofSpitalfields.[Sidenote: James and the Parliament.]But while Englishmen were looking with horror on these events in FranceJames was taking advantage of the position in which as he believed theyplaced him. The news of the revocation drew from James expressions ofdelight. The rapid increase of the conversions to Catholicism whichfollowed on the "dragonnades" raised in him hopes of as general anapostasy in his own dominions. His tone took a new haughtiness anddecision. He admitted more Catholic officers into his fresh regiments.He dismissed Halifax from the Privy Council on his refusal to consent toa plan for repealing the Test Act. He met the Parliament on itsreassembling in November with a haughty declaration that whether legalor no his grant of commissions to Catholics must not be questioned, andwith a demand of supplies for his new troops. Loyal as was the temper ofthe Houses, their alarm for the Church, their dread of a standing army,was yet stronger than their loyalty. The Commons by the majority of asingle vote deferred the grant of supplies till grievances wereredressed, and demanded in their address the recall of the illegalcommissions on the ground that the continuance of the Catholic officersin their posts "may be taken to be a dispensing with that law withoutAct of Parliament." The Lords took a bolder tone; and the protest of thebishops against any infringement of the Test Act expressed by BishopCompton of London was backed by the eloquence of Halifax. Their desirefor conciliation indeed was shown in an offer to confirm the existingofficers in their posts by Act of Parliament, and even to allow freshnominations of Catholics by the king under the same security. But Jameshad no wish for such a compromise, and the Houses were at onceprorogued.[Sidenote: The Test set aside.]The king resolved to obtain from the judges what he could not obtainfrom Parliament. He remodelled the bench by dismissing four judges whorefused to lend themselves to his plans; and in the June of 1686 theirsuccessors decided in the case of Sir Edward Hales, a Catholic officerin the army, that a royal dispensation could be pleaded in bar of theTest Act. The principle laid down by the judges "that it is a privilegeinseparably connected with the sovereignty of the King to dispense withpenal laws, and that according to his own judgment," was applied byJames with a reckless impatience of all decency and self-restraint.Catholics were admitted into civil and military offices without stint,and four Catholic peers were sworn as members of the Privy Council. Thelaws which forbade the presence of Catholic priests in the realm or theopen exercise of Catholic worship were set at nought. A gorgeous chapelwas opened in the palace of St. James for the use of the king.Carmelites, Benedictines, Franciscans, appeared in their religious garbin the streets of London, and the Jesuits set up a crowded school in theSavoy. The quick growth of discontent at these acts would have startleda wiser man into prudence, but James prided himself on an obstinacywhich never gave way; and a riot which took place on the opening of aCatholic chapel in the City was followed by the establishment of a campof thirteen thousand men at Hounslow to overawe the capital.[Sidenote: Scotland and Ireland.]The course which James intended to follow in England was shown indeed bythe course he was following in the sister kingdoms. In Scotland he actedas a pure despot. At the close of Charles's reign the extremeCovenanters or "wild Whigs" of the Western shires had formally renouncedtheir allegiance to a "prelatical" king. A smouldering revolt spreadover the country that was only held in check by the merciless crueltieswith which the royal troops avenged the "rabbling of priests" and theoutrages committed by the Whigs on the more prominent persecutors. Sucha revolt threw strength into the hands of the government by rallying toits side all who were bent on public order, and this strength wasdoubled by the landing and failure of Argyle. The Scotch Parliamentgranted excise and customs not to the king only but to his successors,while it confirmed the Acts which established religious conformity. ButJames was far from being satisfied with a loyalty which made noconcession to the "king's religion." He placed the government ofScotland in the hands of two lords, Melfort and Perth, who had embracedhis own faith, and put a Catholic in command of the Castle of Edinburgh.The drift of these measures was soon seen. The Scotch Parliament had asyet been the mere creature of the Crown, but servile as were its membersthere was a point at which their servility stopped. When James boldlyrequired them to legalize the toleration of Catholics they refused topass such an Act. It was in vain that the king tempted them to consentby the offer of a free trade with England. "Shall we sell our God?" wasthe indignant reply. James at once ordered the Scotch judges to treatall laws against Catholics as null and void, and his orders were obeyed.In Ireland his policy threw off even the disguise of law. Catholics wereadmitted by the king's command to the council and to civil offices. ACatholic, Lord Tyrconnell, was put at the head of the army, and setinstantly about its re-organization by cashiering Protestant officersand by admitting two thousand Catholic natives into its ranks.[Sidenote: The High Commission.]Meanwhile in England James was passing from the mere attempt to securefreedom for his fellow-religionists to a bold and systematic attackupon the Church. He had at the outset of his reign forbidden the clergyto preach against "the king's religion"; and ordered the bishops to actupon this prohibition. But no steps were taken by them to carry out thisorder; and the pulpits of the capital soon rang with controversialsermons. For such a sermon James now called on Compton, the Bishop ofLondon, to suspend Dr. Sharp, the rector of St. Giles'-in-the-Fields.Compton answered that as judge he was ready to examine into the case ifbrought before him according to law. To James the matter was not one oflaw but of prerogative. He regarded his ecclesiastical supremacy as aweapon providentially left to him for undoing the work which it hadenabled his predecessors to do. Under Henry and Elizabeth it had beenused to turn the Church of England from Catholic to Protestant. UnderJames it might be used to turn the Church back again from Protestant toCatholic. The High Commission indeed which had enforced this supremacyhad been declared illegal by an Act of the Long Parliament, and this Acthad been confirmed by the Parliament of the Restoration. But it wasthought possible to evade this Act by omitting from the instructions onwhich the Commission acted the extraordinary powers and jurisdictions bywhich its predecessor had given offence. With this reserve, sevencommissioners were appointed in the summer of 1686 for the governmentof the Church with the Chancellor, Lord Jeffreys, at their head. Thefirst blow of the Commission was at the Bishop of London whose refusalto suspend Sharp was punished by his own suspension. But the pressure ofthe Commission only drove the clergy to a bolder defiance of the royalwill. The legality of the Commission and of its proceedings was denied.Not even the Pope, it was said, had claimed such rights over the conductand jurisdiction of English bishops as were claimed by the king. Theprohibition of attacks on the "king's religion" was set at nought.Sermons against superstition were preached from every pulpit; and thetwo most famous divines of the day, Tillotson and Stillingfleet, putthemselves at the head of a host of controversialists who scatteredpamphlets and tracts from every printing press.[Sidenote: James and the Tories.]It was in vain that the bulk of the Catholic gentry stood aloof andpredicted the inevitable reaction which the king's course must bringabout, or that Rome itself counselled greater moderation. James wasinfatuated with what seemed to be the success of his enterprises. Helooked on the opposition he experienced as due to the influence of theHigh Church Tories who had remained in power since the reaction of 1681,and these he determined "to chastise." The Duke of Queensberry, theleader of this party in Scotland, was driven from office. Tyrconnell, aswe have seen, was placed as a check on Ormond in Ireland. In EnglandJames resolved to show the world that even the closest ties of bloodwere as nothing to him if they conflicted with the demands of his faith.His earlier marriage with Anne Hyde, the daughter of Clarendon, boundboth the Chancellor's sons to his fortunes; and on his accession he hadsent his elder brother-in-law, Edward, Earl of Clarendon, asLord-Lieutenant to Ireland, and raised the younger, Laurence, Earl ofRochester, who had long been a minister under Charles the Second, to thepost of Lord Treasurer. But the sons of Hyde were as staunch to the oldCavalier doctrines of Church and State as Hyde himself. Rochestertherefore was told in the opening of 1687 that the king could not safelyentrust so great a charge to any one who did not share his sentiments onreligion, and on his refusal to abandon his faith he was deprived of theWhite Staff. His brother Clarendon shared his fall. A Catholic, LordBellasys, became First Lord of the Treasury, which was again put intocommission after Rochester's removal; and another Catholic, LordArundell, became Lord Privy Seal; while Father Petre, a Jesuit, wascalled to the Privy Council.[Sidenote: The Tory Nobles.]The dismissal of Rochester sprang mainly from a belief that with such aminister James would fail to procure from the Parliament that freedomfor Catholics which he was bent on establishing. It was in fact adeclaration that on this matter none in the king's service must opposethe king's will, and it was followed up by the dismissal of one officialafter another who refused to aid in the repeal of the Test Act. But actslike these were of no avail against the steady growth of resistance. Ifthe great Tory nobles were staunch for the Crown, they were as resoluteEnglishmen in their hatred of mere tyranny as the Whigs themselves.James gave the Duke of Norfolk the sword of State to carry before him ashe went to Mass. The Duke stopped at the Chapel door. "Your father wouldhave gone further," said the king. "Your Majesty's father was the betterman," replied the Duke, "and he would not have gone so far." The youngDuke of Somerset was ordered to introduce into the Presence Chamber thePapal Nuncio, who was now received in State at Windsor in the teeth of astatute which forbade diplomatic relations with Rome. "I am advised,"Somerset answered, "that I cannot obey your Majesty without breaking thelaw." "Do you not know that I am above the law?" James asked angrily."Your Majesty may be, but I am not," retorted the Duke. He was dismissedfrom his post, but the spirit of resistance spread fast. In spite of theking's letters the governors of the Charterhouse, who numbered amongthem some of the greatest English nobles, refused to admit a Catholic tothe benefits of the foundation. The most devoted loyalists began tomurmur when James demanded apostasy as a proof of their loyalty.[Sidenote: James and the Nonconformists.]He had in fact to abandon at last all hope of bringing the Church or theTories over to his will, and in the spring of 1687 he turned, as Charleshad turned, to the Nonconformists. He published in April a Declarationof Indulgence which suspended the operation of the penal laws againstNonconformists and Catholics alike, and of every Act which imposed atest as a qualification for office in Church or State. A hope wasexpressed that this measure would be sanctioned by Parliament when itwas suffered to reassemble. The temptation to accept the Indulgence wasgreat, for since the fall of Shaftesbury persecution had fallen heavilyon the Protestant dissidents, and we can hardly wonder that theNonconformists wavered for a time or that numerous addresses of thankswere presented to James. But the great body of them, and all the morevenerable names among them, remained true to the cause of freedom.Baxter, Howe, and Bunyan all refused an Indulgence which could only bepurchased by the violent overthrow of the law. It was plain that theonly mode of actually securing the end which James had in view was toprocure a repeal of the Test Act from Parliament itself. It was to thisthat the king's dismissal of Rochester and other ministerial changes hadbeen directed; but James found that the temper of the existing Houses,so far as he could test it, remained absolutely opposed to his project.In July therefore he dissolved the Parliament, and summoned a new one.In spite of the support he might expect from the Nonconformists in theelections, he knew that no free Parliament could be brought to consentto the repeal. The Lords indeed could be swamped by lavish creations ofnew peers. "Your troop of horse," Lord Sunderland told Churchill, "shallbe called up into the House of Lords." But it was a harder matter tosecure a compliant House of Commons. No effort however was spared. TheLord-Lieutenants were directed to bring about such a "regulation" of thegoverning body in boroughs as would ensure the return of candidatespledged to the repeal of the Test, and to question every magistrate intheir county as to his vote. Half of them at once refused to comply, anda string of great nobles--the Lords of Oxford, Shrewsbury, Dorset,Derby, Pembroke, Rutland, Abergavenny, Thanet, Northampton, andAbingdon--were dismissed from their Lord-Lieutenancies. The justiceswhen questioned simply replied that they would vote according to theirconsciences, and send members to Parliament who would protect theProtestant religion. After repeated "regulations" it was foundimpossible to form a corporate body which would return representativeswilling to comply with the royal will. All thought of a Parliament hadto be abandoned; and even the most bigoted courtiers counselledmoderation at this proof of the stubborn opposition which James mustprepare to encounter from the peers, the gentry, and the tradingclasses.[Sidenote: The Attack on the Universities.]Estranged as he was from the whole body of the nobles and gentry itremained for James to force the clergy also into an attitude ofresistance. Even the tyranny of the Commission had failed to drive intoopen opposition men who had been preaching Sunday after Sunday thedoctrine of passive obedience to the worst of kings. But James who hadnow finally abandoned all hope of winning the aid of the Church in hisproject cared little for passive obedience. He looked on the refusal ofthe clergy to support his plans as freeing him from the pledge he hadgiven to maintain the Church as established by law; and he resolved toattack it in the great institutions which had till now been itsstrongholds. To secure the Universities for Catholicism was to seize theonly training schools which the English clergy possessed as well as theonly centres of higher education which existed for the English gentry.It was on such a seizure however that James's mind was set. Littleindeed was done with Cambridge. A Benedictine monk, who presentedhimself with royal letters recommending him for the degree of a Masterof Arts, was rejected on his refusal to sign the Articles; and theVice-Chancellor was summoned before the Privy Council and punished forhis rejection by deprivation from office. But a violent and obstinateattack was directed against Oxford. The Master of University College,Obadiah Walker, who declared himself a Catholic convert, was authorizedto retain his post in defiance of the law. A Roman Catholic named Masseywas presented by the Crown to the Deanery of Christ Church. Magdalen wasthe wealthiest College in the University; and James in 1687 recommendedone Farmer, a Catholic of infamous life and not even qualified bystatute for the office, to its vacant headship. The Fellowsremonstrated, and on the rejection of their remonstrance chose Hough,one of their own number, as their President. The EcclesiasticalCommission declared the election void; and James, shamed out of hisfirst candidate, recommended a second, Parker, Bishop of Oxford, aCatholic in heart and the meanest of his courtiers. The Fellows howeverpleaded that Hough was already chosen, and they held stubbornly to theirlegal head. It was in vain that the king visited Oxford, summoned themto his presence, and rated them as they knelt before him likeschoolboys. "I am King," he said; "I will be obeyed! Go to your chapelthis instant, and elect the Bishop! Let those who refuse look to it, forthey shall feel the whole weight of my hand!" It was seen that to giveMagdalen as well as Christ Church into Catholic hands was to turnOxford into a Catholic seminary, and the king's threats weredisregarded. But they were soon carried out. A special Commissionvisited the University, pronounced Hough an intruder, set aside hisappeal to the law, burst open the door of his president's house toinstall Parker in his place, and on their refusal to submit deprived theFellows of their fellowships. The expulsion of the Fellows was followedon a like refusal by that of the Demies. Parker, who died immediatelyafter his installation, was succeeded by a Roman Catholic bishop _inpartibus_, named Bonaventure Gifford, and twelve Roman Catholics wereadmitted to fellowships in a single day.[Sidenote: James and William.]With peers, gentry, and clergy in dogged opposition the scheme ofwresting a repeal of the Test Act from a new Parliament becameimpracticable, and without this--as James well knew--his system ofIndulgence, even if he was able to maintain it so long, must end withhis death and the accession of a Protestant sovereign. It was to provideagainst such a defeat of his designs that he stooped to ask the aid ofWilliam of Orange. Ever since his accession William had followed hisfather-in-law's course with a growing anxiety. For while England wasseething with the madness of the Popish Plot and of the royalistreaction the great European struggle which occupied the whole mind ofthe Prince had been drawing nearer and nearer. The patience of Germanyindeed was worn out by the ceaseless aggressions of Lewis, and in 1686its princes had bound themselves at Augsburg to resist all furtherencroachments on the part of France. From that moment war becameinevitable, and in such a war William had always held that the aid ofEngland was essential to success. But his efforts to ensure English aidhad utterly failed. James, as William soon came to know, had renewed hisbrother's secret treaty with France; and even had this been otherwisehis quarrel with his people would of itself have prevented him fromgiving any aid in a struggle abroad. The Prince could only silently lookon with a desperate hope that James might yet be brought to a noblerpolicy. He refused all encouragement to the leading malcontents who werealready calling on him to interfere in arms. On the other hand hedeclined to support the king in his schemes for the abolition of theTest. If he still cherished hopes of bringing about a peace between theking and people which might enable him to enlist England in the GrandAlliance, they vanished in 1687 before the Declaration of Indulgence. Itwas at this moment, at the end of May, that James called on him and Maryto declare themselves in favour of the abolition of the penal laws andof the Test. "Conscience, honour, and good policy," wrote James, "bindme to procure safety for the Catholics. I cannot leave those who haveremained faithful to the old and true religion subject to the oppressionunder which the laws place them."[Sidenote: The King's hopes.]But simultaneously with the king's appeal letters of great importreached the Prince from the leading nobles. Some, like the Hydes, simplyassured him of their friendship. The Bishop of London added assurancesof support. Others, like Devonshire, Nottingham, and Shrewsbury,cautiously or openly warned the Prince against compliance with theking's demand. Lord Churchill announced the resolve of Mary's sisterAnne to stand in any case by the cause of Protestantism. Danby, theleading representative of the great Tory party, told the Dutchambassador plainly to warn William that if James was suffered to pursuehis present course, and above all to gain control over the Parliament,he would leave the Catholic party strong enough at his death to threatenMary's succession. The letters dictated William's answer. No one, hetruly protested, loathed religious persecution more than he himself did,but in relaxing political disabilities James called on him tocountenance an attack on his own religion. "I cannot," he ended, "concurin what your Majesty desires of me." William's refusal was justified, aswe have seen, by the result of the efforts to assemble a Parliamentfavourable to the repeal of the Test. The wholesale dismissal ofjustices and Lord-Lieutenants through the summer of 1687 failed toshake the resolve of the counties. The "regulation" of theircorporations by the displacing of their older members and thesubstitution of Nonconformists did little to gain the towns. The year1688 indeed had hardly opened when it was found necessary to adjourn theelections which had been fixed for February, and to make a fresh attemptto win a warmer support from the dissidents and from the country. ForJames clung with a desperate tenacity to the hope of finding a compliantParliament. He knew, what was as yet unknown to the world, the fact thathis Queen was with child. The birth of an heir would meet the dangerwhich he looked for from the succession of William and Mary. But Jameswas past middle life, and his death would leave his boy at the mercy ofa Regency which could hardly fail to be composed of men who would undothe king's work and even bring up the young sovereign as a Protestant.His own security, as he thought, against such a course lay in thebuilding up a strong Catholic party, in placing Catholics in the highoffices of State, and in providing against their expulsion from these athis death by a repeal of the Test. But such a repeal could only be wonfrom Parliament, and hopeless as the effort seemed James presseddoggedly on in his attempt to secure Houses who would carry out hiswill.[Sidenote: The Trial of the Bishops.]The renewed Declaration of Indulgence which he issued in 1688 was notonly intended to win the Nonconformists by fresh assurances of theking's sincerity, it was an appeal to the nation at large. At its closehe promised to summon a Parliament in November, and he called on theelectors to choose such members as would bring to a successful end thepolicy he had begun. His resolve, he said, was to make merit the onequalification for office and to establish universal liberty ofconscience for all future time. It was in this character of a royalappeal that he ordered every clergyman to read the Declaration duringdivine service on two successive Sundays. Little time was given fordeliberation; but little time was needed. The clergy refused almost to aman to be the instruments of their own humiliation. The Declaration wasread in only four of the London churches, and in these the congregationflocked out of church at the first words of it. Nearly all the countryparsons refused to obey the royal orders, and the Bishops went with therest of the clergy. A few days before the appointed Sunday ArchbishopSancroft called his suffragans together, and the six who were able toappear at Lambeth signed a temperate protest to the king in which theydeclined to publish an illegal Declaration. "It is a standard ofrebellion," James exclaimed, as the Primate presented the paper; and theresistance of the clergy was no sooner announced to him than hedetermined to wreak his vengeance on the prelates who had signed theprotest. He ordered the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to deprive them oftheir sees; but in this matter even the Commissioners shrank fromobeying him. The Chancellor, Lord Jeffreys, advised a prosecution forlibel as an easier mode of punishment; and the Bishops, who refused togive bail, were committed on this charge to the Tower. They passed totheir prison amidst the shouts of a great multitude; the sentinels kneltfor their blessing as they entered its gates, and the soldiers of thegarrison drank their healths. So threatening was the temper of thenation that his ministers pressed James to give way. But his obstinacygrew with the danger. "Indulgence," he said, "ruined my father"; and onthe 29th of June the Bishops appeared as criminals at the bar of theKing's Bench. The jury had been packed, the judges were mere tools ofthe Crown, but judges and jury were alike overawed by the indignation ofthe people at large. No sooner had the foreman of the jury uttered thewords "Not guilty" than a roar of applause burst from the crowd, andhorsemen spurred along every road to carry over the country the news ofthe acquittal.[Sidenote: The National discontent.]James was at Hounslow when the news of the verdict reached him, and ashe rode from the camp he heard a great shout behind him. "What is that?"he asked. "It is nothing," was the reply; "only the soldiers are gladthat the Bishops are acquitted!" "Do you call that nothing?" grumbledthe king. The shout told him that he stood utterly alone in his realm.The peerage, the gentry, the bishops, the clergy, the universities,every lawyer, every trader, every farmer, stood aloof from him. And nowhis very soldiers forsook him. The most devoted Catholics pressed him togive way. But to give way was to reverse every act he had done since hisaccession and to change the whole nature of his government. All show oflegal rule had disappeared. Sheriffs, mayors, magistrates, appointed bythe Crown in defiance of a parliamentary statute, were no real officersin the eye of the law. Even if the Houses were summoned members returnedby officers such as these could form no legal Parliament. Hardly aMinister of the Crown or a Privy Councillor exercised any lawfulauthority. James had brought things to such a pass that the restorationof legal government meant the absolute reversal of every act he haddone. But he was in no mood to reverse his acts. His temper was onlyspurred to a more dogged obstinacy by danger and remonstrance. "I willlose all," he said to the Spanish ambassador who counselled moderation;"I will lose all or win all." He broke up the camp at Hounslow anddispersed its troops in distant cantonments. He dismissed the two judgeswho had favoured the acquittal of the Bishops. He ordered thechancellor of each diocese to report the names of the clergy who had notread the Declaration of Indulgence. But his will broke fruitlesslyagainst a sullen resistance which met him on every side. Not achancellor made a return to the Commissioners, and the Commissionerswere cowed into inaction by the temper of the nation. When the judgeswho had displayed their servility to the Crown went on circuit thegentry refused to meet them. A yet fiercer irritation was kindled by theking's resolve to supply the place of the English troops whose temperproved unserviceable for his purposes by drafts from the Catholic armywhich Tyrconnell had raised in Ireland. Even the Roman Catholic peers atthe Council-table protested against this measure; and six officers in asingle regiment laid down their commissions rather than enrol the Irishrecruits among their men. The ballad of "Lillibullero," a scurrilousattack on the Irish recruits, was sung from one end of England to theother.[Sidenote: The Invitation.]Wide however as the disaffection undoubtedly was the position of Jamesseemed fairly secure. He counted on the aid of France. His army,whatever signs of discontent it might show, was still a formidable forceof twenty thousand men. Scotland, disheartened by the failure ofArgyle's rising, could give no such help as it gave to the LongParliament. Ireland on the other hand was ready to throw a Catholicarmy in the king's support on the western coast. It was doubtful too ifin England itself disaffection would turn into actual revolt. The BloodyAssize had left its terror on the Whigs. The Tories and Churchmen,angered as they were, were still hampered by their horror of rebellionand their doctrine of non-resistance. Above all the eyes of the nationrested on William and Mary. James was past middle age, and a few yearsmust bring a Protestant successor and restore the reign of law. But inthe midst of the struggle with the Church it was announced that theQueen was again with child. The news was received with general unbelief,for five years had passed since the last pregnancy of Mary of Modena,and the unbelief passed into a general expectation of some imposture asmen watched the joy of the Catholics and their confident prophecies thatthe child would be a boy. But, truth or imposture, it was plain that theappearance of a Prince of Wales must bring on a crisis. If the childturned out a boy, and as was certain was brought up a Catholic, thehighest Tory had to resolve at last whether the tyranny under whichEngland lay should go on for ever. The hesitation of the country was atan end. Danby, loyal above all to the Church and firm in his hatred ofsubservience to France, answered for the Tories. Compton answered forthe High Churchmen, goaded at last into rebellion by the Declaration ofIndulgence. The Earl of Devonshire, the Lord Cavendish of the Exclusionstruggle, answered for the Nonconformists, who were satisfied withWilliam's promise to procure them toleration, as well as for the generalbody of the Whigs. The announcement of the boy's birth on the 10th ofJune was followed ten days after by a formal invitation to William tointervene in arms for the restoration of English liberty and theprotection of the Protestant religion. The invitation was signed byDanby, Devonshire, and Compton, the representatives of the great partieswhose long fight was hushed at last by a common danger, by two recentconverts from the Catholic faith, the Earl of Shrewsbury and LordLumley, by Edward the cousin of Lord Russell, and by Henry the brotherof Algernon Sidney. It was carried to the Hague by Herbert, the mostpopular of English seamen, who had been deprived of his command for arefusal to vote against the Test.[Sidenote: James and France.]The Invitation called on the Prince of Orange to land with an armystrong enough to justify those who signed it in rising in arms. Anoutbreak of revolt was in fact inevitable, and either its success ordefeat must be equally fatal to William should he refuse to put himselfat its head. If the rebels were victorious, their resentment at hisdesertion of their cause in the hour of need would make Mary'ssuccession impossible and probably bring about the establishment of aCommonwealth. On the other hand the victory of the king would not onlyruin English freedom and English Protestantism, but fling the wholeweight of England in the contest for the liberties of Europe which wasnow about to open into the scale of France. From the opening of 1688 thesigns of a mutual understanding between the English Court and the Frenchhad been unmistakeable. James had declared himself on the side of Lewisin the negotiations with the Empire which followed on the Treaty ofAugsburg. He had backed Sweden in its threats of war against the Dutch.At the instigation of France he had recalled the English and Scotchtroops in the service of the States. He had received supplies from Lewisto send an English fleet to the coast of Holland; and was at this momentsupporting at Rome the French side in the quarrel over the Electorate ofCologne, a quarrel which rendered war inevitable. It was certaintherefore that success at home would secure James's aid to France in thestruggle abroad.[Sidenote: William's Acceptance.]It was this above all which decided the action of the Prince, for theruling passion in William's heart was the longing to free Europe fromthe supremacy of France. It was this too which made his enterprisepossible, for nothing but a sense of their own danger would have forcedhis opponents in Holland itself to assent to his expedition. Theirassent however once gained, William strained all his resources asAdmiral and Captain-General to gather a fleet and a sufficient forceunder pretext of defence against the English fleet which now appeared inthe Channel, while Brandenburg promised to supply the place of the Dutchforces during their absence in England by lending the States ninethousand men. As soon as the news of these preparations reached Englandnoble after noble made his way to the Hague. The Earl of Shrewsburybrought L2000 towards the expenses of the expedition. Edward Russell,the representative of the Whig Earl of Bedford, was followed by therepresentatives of great Tory houses, by the sons of the Marquis ofWinchester, of Lord Danby, of Lord Peterborough, and by LordMacclesfield, a well-known High Churchman. At home the Earls of Danbyand Devonshire prepared silently with Lord Lumley for a rising in theNorth. In spite of the profound secrecy with which all was conducted,the keen instinct of Sunderland, who had stooped to purchase continuancein office at the price of a secret apostasy to Catholicism, detected thepreparations of William; and the sense that his master's ruin was athand encouraged him to tell every secret of James on the promise of apardon for the crimes to which he had lent himself. James alone remainedstubborn and insensate as of old. He had no fear of a revolt unaided bythe Prince of Orange, and he believed that the threat of a Frenchattack on Holland itself would render William's departure impossible. Atthe opening of September indeed Lewis declared himself aware of themeaning of the Dutch armaments and warned the States that he should lookon an attack upon James as a war upon himself.[Sidenote: James gives way.]Fortunately for William so open an announcement of the union betweenEngland and France suited ill with the plans of James. He still lookedforward to the coming Parliament, and the knowledge of a league withFrance was certain to make any Parliament reluctant to admit Catholicsto a share in political life. James therefore roughly disavowed the actof Lewis, and William was able to continue his preparations. But evenhad no such disavowal come the threat of Lewis would have remained anempty one. In spite of the counsel of Louvois he looked on an invasionof Holland as likely to serve English interests rather than French andresolved to open the war by a campaign on the Rhine. In September histroops marched eastward, and the Dutch at once felt themselves secure.The States-General gave their public sanction to William's project, andthe armament he had prepared gathered rapidly in the Scheldt. The newsof war and of the diversion of the French forces to Germany no soonerreached England than the king passed from obstinacy to panic. By draftsfrom Scotland and Ireland he had mustered forty thousand men, but thetemper of the troops robbed him of all trust in them. Help from Francewas now out of the question. There was nothing for it but to fall back,as Sunderland had for some time been advising him to fall back, on theolder policy of a union with the Tory party and the party of the Church;and to win assent for his plans from the coming Parliament by anabandonment of his recent acts. But the haste and completeness withwhich James reversed his whole course forbade any belief in hissincerity. He personally appealed for support to the Bishops. Hedissolved the Ecclesiastical Commission. He replaced the magistrates hehad driven from office. He restored their franchises to the towns. TheChancellor carried back the Charter of London in state into the City.The Bishop of Winchester was sent to replace the expelled Fellows ofMagdalen. Catholic chapels and Jesuit schools were ordered to be closed.[Sidenote: William's Landing.]Sunderland pressed for the instant calling of a Parliament. But it wasstill plain that any Parliament would as yet be eager for war withFrance and would probably call on the king to put the Prince of Orangeat the head of his army in such a war. To James therefore Sunderland'scounsel seemed treachery, the issue of a secret design with William toplace him helpless in the Prince's hands and above all to imperil thesuccession of his boy, whose birth William had now been brought byadvice from the English lords to regard as an imposture. He againtherefore fell back on France which made new advances to him in the hopeof meeting this fresh danger of an attack from England; and in the endof October he dismissed Sunderland from office. But Sunderland hadhardly left Whitehall when the Declaration of the Prince of Orangereached England. It demanded the removal of grievances and the callingof a free Parliament which should establish English freedom and religionon a secure basis. It promised toleration to Protestant Nonconformistsand freedom of conscience to Catholics. It left the question of thelegitimacy of the Prince of Wales and the settlement of the successionto Parliament. James was wounded above all by the doubts thrown on thebirth of a Prince; and he produced proofs of the birth before the peerswho were in London. But the proofs came too late. Detained by ill winds,beaten back on its first venture by a violent storm, William's fleet ofsix hundred transports, escorted by fifty men-of-war, anchored on the5th of November in Torbay; and his army, thirteen thousand strong,entered Exeter amid the shouts of its citizens. Great pains had beentaken to strip from William's army the appearance of a foreign force,which might have stirred English feeling to resistance. The core of itconsisted of the English and Scottish regiments which had remained inthe service of the States in spite of their recall by the king. Itsforeign divisions were representatives of the whole Protestant world.With the Dutchmen were Brandenburgers and Swedes, and the most brilliantcorps in the whole army was composed of French refugees.[Sidenote: The National Rising.]The landing seemed at first a failure. The country remained quiet.William's coming had been unexpected in the West, and no great landownerjoined his forces. Though the king's fleet had failed to intercept theexpedition it closed in from the Channel to prevent William's escape assoon as he had landed, while the king's army moved rapidly to encounterhim in the field. But the pause was one of momentary surprise. Before aweek had passed the nobles and squires of the west flocked to William'scamp and the adhesion of Plymouth secured his rear. The call of theking's forces to face the Prince in the south no sooner freed thenorthern parts of England from their presence than the insurrectionbroke out. Scotland threw off the royal rule. Danby, dashing at the headof a hundred horsemen into York, gave the signal for a rising. The Yorkmilitia met his appeal with shouts of "A free Parliament and theProtestant religion"; peers and gentry flocked to his standard; and amarch on Nottingham united his forces to those under Devonshire who hadmustered at Derby the great lords of the midland and eastern counties.Everywhere the revolt was triumphant. The garrison of Hull declared fora free Parliament. The Duke of Norfolk appeared at the head of threehundred gentlemen in the market-place at Norwich. At Oxford townsmen andgownsmen greeted Lord Lovelace and the forces he led with uproariouswelcome. Bristol threw open its gates to the Prince of Orange, whoadvanced steadily on Salisbury where James had assembled his forces.[Sidenote: Flight of James.]But the king's army, broken by dissensions and mutual suspicions amongits leaders, shrank from an engagement and fell back in disorder at hisapproach. Its retreat was the signal for a general abandonment of theroyal cause. The desertion of Lord Churchill, who had from the firstmade his support conditional on the calling of a Parliament, a stepwhich the king still hesitated to take, was followed by that of so manyother officers that James abandoned the struggle in despair. He fled toLondon to hear that his daughter Anne had left St. James's to join Danbyat Nottingham. "God help me," cried the wretched father, "for my ownchildren have forsaken me!" His spirit was utterly broken by the suddencrash; and though he had promised to call the Houses together anddespatched commissioners to Hungerford to treat with William on theterms of a free Parliament, in his heart he had resolved on flight.Parliament, he said to the few who still clung to him, would force onhim concessions he could not endure; while flight would enable him toreturn and regain his throne with the assistance of French forces. Heonly waited therefore for news of the escape of his wife and child onthe 10th of December to make his way to the Isle of Sheppey, where a hoylay ready to carry him to France. Some rough fishermen however who tookhim for a Jesuit prevented his escape, and a troop of Life Guardsbrought him back in safety to London. His return revived the hopes ofthe Tories, who with Clarendon and Rochester at their head looked on thework of the Prince of Orange as done in the overthrow of the king'sdesign of establishing a Catholic despotism, and who trusted that theirsystem would be restored by a reconciliation of James with the ToryParliament they expected to be returned. Halifax however, though he hadlong acted with the Tories, was too clear-sighted for hopes such asthese. He had taken no part in the invitation or revolt, but now thatthe revolution was successful he pressed upon William the impossibilityof carrying out a new system of government with such a sovereign asJames. The Whigs, who had gone beyond hope of forgiveness, backedpowerfully these arguments; and in spite of the pledges with which hehad landed the Prince was soon as convinced of their wisdom as theWhigs. From this moment it was the policy of William and his advisers tofurther a flight which removed their chief difficulty out of the way. Itwould have been hard to depose James had he remained, and perilous tokeep him prisoner; but the entry of the Dutch troops into London, thesilence of the Prince, and an order to leave St. James's filled the kingwith fresh terrors, and taking advantage of the means of escape whichwere almost openly placed at his disposal James a second time quittedLondon and embarked on the 23rd of December unhindered for France.[Sidenote: The Convention.]Before flying James had burnt most of the writs convoking a newParliament, had disbanded his army, and destroyed so far as he could allmeans of government. For a few days there was a wild burst of panic andoutrage in London, but the orderly instinct of the people soonreasserted itself. The Lords who were at the moment in the capitalprovided on their own authority as Privy Councillors for the morepressing needs of administration, and quietly resigned their authorityinto William's hands on his arrival. The difficulty which arose from theabsence of any person legally authorized to call Parliament together wasgot over by convoking the House of Peers, and forming a second body ofall members who had sat in the Commons in the reign of Charles theSecond together with the Aldermen and Common Councillors of London. Bothbodies requested William to take on himself the provisional governmentof the kingdom, and to issue circular letters inviting the electors ofevery town and county to send up representatives to a Convention whichmet on the 22nd of January 1689. In the new Convention both Houses werefound equally resolved against any recall of or negotiation with thefallen king. They were united in entrusting a provisional authority tothe Prince of Orange. But with this step their unanimity ended. TheWhigs, who formed a majority in the Commons, voted a resolution which,illogical and inconsistent as it seemed, was well adapted to unite inits favour every element of the opposition to James, the Churchman whowas simply scared by his bigotry, the Tory who doubted the right of anation to depose its king, the Whig who held the theory of a contractbetween King and People. They voted that King James, "having endeavouredto subvert the constitution of this kingdom by breaking the originalcontract between King and People, and by the advice of Jesuits and otherwicked persons having violated the fundamental laws, and havingwithdrawn himself out of the kingdom, has abdicated the Government, andthat the throne is thereby vacant." But in the Lords where the Torieswere still in the ascendant the resolution was fiercely debated.Archbishop Sancroft with the high Tories held that no crime could bringabout a forfeiture of the crown and that James still remained king, butthat his tyranny had given the nation a right to withdraw from him theactual exercise of government and to entrust his functions to a Regency.The moderate Tories under Danby's guidance admitted that James hadceased to be king but denied that the throne could be vacant, andcontended that from the moment of his abdication the sovereignty vestedin his daughter Mary. It was in vain that the eloquence of Halifaxbacked the Whig peers in struggling for the resolution of the Commons asit stood. The plan of a Regency was lost by a single vote, and Danby'sscheme was adopted by a large majority.[Sidenote: Declaration of Rights.]But both the Tory courses found a sudden obstacle in William. Hedeclined to be Regent. He had no mind, he said to Danby, to be hiswife's gentleman-usher. Mary on the other hand refused to accept thecrown save in conjunction with her husband. The two declarations put anend to the question, and it was settled that William and Mary should beacknowledged as joint sovereigns but that the actual administrationshould rest with William alone. It had been agreed throughout howeverthat before the throne was filled up the constitutional liberties of thesubject must be secured. A Parliamentary Committee in which the mostactive member was John Somers, a young lawyer who had distinguishedhimself in the trial of the Bishops and who was destined to play a greatpart in later history, drew up a Declaration of Rights which after somealterations was adopted by the two Houses. The Declaration recited themisgovernment of James, his abdication, and the resolve of the Lordsand Commons to assert the ancient rights and liberties of Englishsubjects. It condemned as illegal his establishment of an ecclesiasticalcommission, and his raising of an army without Parliamentary sanction.It denied the right of any king to suspend or dispense with laws, asthey had been suspended or dispensed with of late, or to exact moneysave by consent of Parliament. It asserted for the subject a right topetition, to a free choice of representatives in Parliament, and to apure and merciful administration of justice. It declared the right ofboth Houses to liberty of debate. It demanded securities for the freeexercise of their religion by all Protestants, and bound the newsovereign to maintain the Protestant religion as well as the laws andliberties of the nation. "We do claim and insist on the premises," ranthe Declaration, "as our undoubted rights and liberties; encouraged bythe Declaration of his Highness the Prince, we have confidence that hewill perfect the deliverance he has begun and will preserve our rightsagainst all further injury." It ended by declaring the Prince andPrincess of Orange King and Queen of England. The Declaration waspresented to William and Mary on the 13th of February by the two Housesin the Banqueting Room at Whitehall, and at the close of its recitalHalifax, in the name of the Estates of the Realm, prayed them to receivethe crown. William accepted the offer in his own name and in that ofhis wife and declared in a few words the resolve of both to maintain thelaws and to govern by advice of Parliament.[Sidenote: Lewis and the Revolution.]But William's eyes were fixed less on England than on Europe. Hisexpedition had had in his own eyes a European rather than an Englishaim, and in his acceptance of the crown he had been moved not so much bypersonal ambition as by the prospect which offered itself of firmlyknitting together England and Holland, the two great Protestant powerswhose fleets held the mastery of the sea. But the advance from such aunion to the formation of the European alliance against France on whichhe was bent was a step that still had to be made. Already indeed hisaction in England had told decisively on the contest. The blunder ofLewis in choosing Germany instead of Holland for his point of attack hadbeen all but atoned for by the brilliant successes with which he openedthe war. The whole country west of the Rhine fell at once into hishands; his armies made themselves masters of the Palatinate, andpenetrated even to Wuertemberg. The hopes of the French king indeed hadnever been higher than at the moment when the arrival of James at St.Germain dashed all hope to the ground. Lewis was at once thrown back ona war of defence, and the brutal ravages which marked the retreat of hisarmies from the Rhine revealed the bitterness with which his pridestooped to the necessity.[Sidenote: The Grand Alliance.]But his reception of James at St. Germain as still king of England gavefresh force to William's efforts. It was yet doubtful whether Williamwould be able to bring England to a hearty co-operation in the struggleagainst French ambition. But whatever reluctance there might have beento follow him in an attack on France with the view of saving theliberties of Europe, the stoutest Tory had none in following him in suchan attack when it meant simply self-defence against a French restorationof the Stuart king at the cost of English freedom. It was with universalapproval that the English Government declared war against Lewis. It wassoon followed in this step by Holland, and the two countries at onceagreed to stand by one another in their struggle against France. But itwas more difficult to secure the co-operation of the two branches of theHouse of Austria in Germany and Spain, reluctant as they were to jointhe Protestant powers in league against a Catholic king. Spain howeverwas forced by Lewis into war, for he aimed at the Netherlands as hisespecial prey; and the court of Vienna at last yielded to the bait heldout by Holland of a recognition of its claims to the Spanish succession.[Sidenote: Scotland and the Revolution.]The adhesion of these powers in the spring of 1689 completed the GrandAlliance of the European powers which William had designed; and theunion of Savoy with the allies girt France in on every side save that ofSwitzerland with a ring of foes. Lewis was left without a single allysave the Turk; for though the Scandinavian kingdoms stood aloof from theconfederacy of Europe their neutrality was unfriendly to him. But theenergy and quickness of movement which sprang from the concentration ofthe power of France in a single hand still left the contest an equalone. The empire was slow to move; the court of Vienna was distractedwith a war against the Turks; Spain was all but powerless; Holland andEngland were alone earnest in the struggle, and England could as yetgive little aid in it. One English brigade indeed, formed from theregiments raised by James, joined the Dutch army on the Sambre, anddistinguished itself under Churchill, who had been rewarded for histreason with the title of Earl of Marlborough, in a brisk skirmish withthe enemy at Walcourt. But for the bulk of his forces William had as yetgrave work to do at home. In England not a sword had been drawn forJames. In Scotland his tyranny had been yet greater than in England, andso far as the Lowlands went the fall of his tyranny was as rapid andcomplete. No sooner had he called his troops southward to meet William'sinvasion than Edinburgh rose in revolt. The western peasants were atonce up in arms; and the Episcopalian clergy, who had been theinstruments of the Stuart misgovernment ever since the Restoration, wererabbled and driven from their parsonages in every parish. The news ofthese disorders forced William to act, though he was without a show oflegal authority over Scotland. On the advice of the Scotch Lords presentin London he ventured to summon a Convention similar to that which hadbeen summoned in England, and on his own responsibility to set aside thelaws passed by the "Drunken Parliament" of the Restoration whichexcluded Presbyterians from the Scotch Parliament. This Conventionresolved that James had forfeited the crown by misgovernment, andoffered it to William and Mary. The offer was accompanied by a Claim ofRight framed on the model of the Declaration of Rights to which the twosovereigns had consented in England, but closing with a demand for theabolition of Prelacy. Both crown and claim were accepted, and thearrival of the Scotch regiments which William had brought from Hollandgave strength to the new Government.[Sidenote: Killiecrankie.]Its strength was to be roughly tested. On the revolt of the capital JohnGraham of Claverhouse, whose cruelties in the persecution of the WesternCovenanters had been rewarded with high command in the Scotch army andwith the title of Viscount Dundee, withdrew with a few troopers fromEdinburgh to the Highlands and appealed to the clans. In the Highlandsnothing was known of English government or misgovernment: all that theRevolution meant to a Highlander was the restoration of the House ofArgyle. To many of the clans it meant the restoration of lands which hadbeen granted them on the Earl's attainder; and the zeal of theMacdonalds, the Macleans, the Camerons, who were as ready to join Dundeein fighting the Campbells and the Government which upheld them as theyhad been ready to join Montrose in the same cause forty years before,was quickened by a reluctance to disgorge their spoil. They were soon inarms. William's Scotch regiments under General Mackay were sent tosuppress the rising; but as they climbed the pass of Killiecrankie onthe 27th of July 1689 Dundee charged them at the head of three thousandclansmen and swept them in headlong rout down the glen. His death in themoment of victory broke however the only bond which held the Highlanderstogether, and in a few weeks the host which had spread terror throughthe Lowlands melted helplessly away. In the next summer Mackay was ableto build the strong post of Fort William in the very heart of thedisaffected country, and his offers of money and pardon brought aboutthe submission of the clans.[Sidenote: Massacre of Glencoe.]The work of peace was sullied by an act of cruel treachery the memory ofwhich still lingers in the minds of men. Sir John Dalrymple, the Masterof Stair, in whose hands the government of Scotland at this time mainlyrested, had hoped that a refusal of the oath of allegiance would givegrounds for a war of extermination and free Scotland for ever from itsdread of the Highlanders. He had provided for the expected refusal byorders of a ruthless severity. "Your troops," he wrote to the officer incommand, "will destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Locheil'slands, Keppoch's, Glengarry's, and Glencoe's. Your powers shall be largeenough. I hope the soldiers will not trouble the Government withprisoners." But his hopes were disappointed by the readiness with whichthe clans accepted the offers of the Government. All submitted in goodtime save Macdonald of Glencoe, whose pride delayed his taking of theoath till six days after the latest date fixed by the proclamation.Foiled in his larger hopes of destruction Dalrymple seized eagerly onthe pretext given by Macdonald, and an order "for the extirpation ofthat sect of robbers" was laid before William and received the royalsignature. "The work," wrote the Master of Stair to Colonel Hamilton whoundertook it, "must be secret and sudden." The troops were chosen fromamong the Campbells, the deadly foes of the clansmen of Glencoe, andquartered peacefully among the Macdonalds for twelve days till allsuspicion of their errand disappeared. At daybreak on the 13th ofFebruary 1692 they fell on their hosts, and in a few moments thirty ofthe clansfolk lay dead on the snow. The rest, sheltered by a storm,escaped to the mountains to perish for the most part of cold and hunger."The only thing I regret," said the Master of Stair, when the newsreached him, "is that any got away."But whatever horror the Massacre of Glencoe has roused in later days fewsave Dalrymple knew of it at the time. The peace of the Highlandsenabled the work of reorganization to go on quietly at Edinburgh. Inaccepting the Claim of Right with its repudiation of Prelacy William hadin effect restored the Presbyterian Church to which nine-tenths of theLowland Scotchmen clung, and its restoration was accompanied by therevival of the Westminster Confession as a standard of faith and by thepassing of an Act which abolished lay patronage. Against the TolerationAct which the king proposed the Scotch Parliament stood firm. But thoughthe measure failed the king was as firm in his purpose as theParliament. So long as he reigned, William declared in memorable words,there should be no persecution for conscience' sake. "We never could beof that mind that violence was suited to the advancing of true religion,nor do we intend that our authority shall ever be a tool to theirregular passions of any party."[Sidenote: The Irish Rising.]It was not in Scotland however but in Ireland that James and Lewis hopedto arrest William's progress. Ireland had long been the object ofspecial attention on the part of James. In the middle of his reign, whenhis chief aim was to provide against the renewed depression of hisfellow-religionists at his death by any Protestant successor, he hadresolved (if we may trust the statement of the French ambassador) toplace Ireland in such a position of independence that she might serve asa refuge for his Catholic subjects. It was with a view to the success ofthis design that Lord Clarendon was dismissed from the Lord-Lieutenancyand succeeded in the charge of the island by the Catholic Earl ofTyrconnell. The new governor, who was raised to a dukedom, went roughlyto work. Every Englishman was turned out of office. Every Judge, everyPrivy Councillor, every Mayor and Alderman of a borough, was required tobe a Catholic and an Irishman. The Irish army, raised to the number offifty thousand men and purged of its Protestant soldiers, was entrustedto Catholic officers. In a few months the English ascendency wasoverthrown, and the life and fortune of the English settlers were at themercy of the natives on whom they had trampled since Cromwell's day. Theking's flight and the agitation among the native Irish at the newsspread panic therefore through the island. Another massacre was believedto be at hand; and fifteen hundred Protestant families, chiefly from thesouth, fled in terror over sea. The Protestants of the north on theother hand drew together at Enniskillen and Londonderry, and preparedfor self-defence. The outbreak however was still delayed, and for twomonths Tyrconnell intrigued with William's Government. But his aim wassimply to gain time. He was at this very moment indeed inviting James toreturn to Ireland, and assuring him of his fidelity. To James this callpromised the aid of an army which would enable him to help the Scotchrising and to effect a landing in England, while Lewis saw in it themeans of diverting William from giving effectual aid to the GrandAlliance. A staff of French officers with arms, ammunition, and a supplyof money was placed therefore at the service of the exiled king, and thenews of his coming no sooner reached Dublin at the opening of 1689 thanTyrconnell threw off the mask. A flag was hoisted over Dublin Castlewith the words embroidered on its folds "Now or Never." The signalcalled every Catholic to arms. The maddened Irishmen flung themselves onthe plunder which their masters had left and in a few weeks havoc wasdone, the French envoy told Lewis, which it would take years to repair.[Sidenote: Siege of Londonderry.]It was in this condition that James found Ireland when he landed atKinsale. The rising of the natives had already baffled his plans. To himas to Lewis Ireland was simply a basis of operations against William,and whatever were their hopes of a future restoration of the soil to itsolder possessors both kings were equally anxious that no strife of racesshould at this moment interrupt their plans of an invasion of Englandwith the fifty thousand soldiers that Tyrconnell was said to have at hisdisposal. But long ere James landed the war of races had already begun.To Tyrconnell indeed and the Irish leaders the king's plans were utterlydistasteful. They had no wish for an invasion and conquest of Englandwhich would replace Ireland again in its position of dependence. Theirpolicy was simply that of Ireland for the Irish, and the first step insuch a policy was to drive out the Englishmen who still stood at bay inUlster. Half of Tyrconnell's army therefore had already been sentagainst Londonderry, where the bulk of the fugitives found shelterbehind a weak wall, manned by a few old guns and destitute even of aditch. But the seven thousand desperate Englishmen behind the wall madeup for its weakness. They rejected with firmness the offers of James,who was still anxious to free his hands from a strife which broke hisplans. They kept up their fire even when the neighbouring Protestantswith their women and children were brutally driven under their walls andplaced in the way of their guns. So fierce were their sallies, socrushing the repulse of his attack, that the king's general, Hamilton,at last turned the siege into a blockade. The Protestants died of hungerin the streets and of the fever which comes of hunger, but the cry ofthe town was still "No Surrender." The siege had lasted a hundred andfive days, and only two days' food remained in Londonderry when on the28th of July an English ship broke the boom across the river, and thebesiegers sullenly withdrew.[Sidenote: James and Ireland.]Their defeat was turned into a rout by the men of Enniskillen whostruggled through a bog to charge an Irish force of double their numberat Newtown Butler, and drove horse and foot before them in a panic whichsoon spread through Hamilton's whole army. The routed soldiers fell backon Dublin where James lay helpless in the hands of the frenziedParliament which he had summoned. Every member returned was an Irishmanand a Catholic, and their one aim was to undo the successiveconfiscations which had given the soil to English settlers and to getback Ireland for the Irish. The Act of Settlement, on which all title toproperty rested, was at once repealed in spite of the king's reluctance.He was told indeed bluntly that if he did not do Ireland justice not anIrishman would fight for him. It was to strengthen this work by ensuringthe legal forfeiture of their lands that three thousand Protestants ofname and fortune were massed together in the hugest Bill of Attainderwhich the world has seen. To the bitter memory of past wrongs was addedthe fury of religious bigotry. In spite of the king's promise ofreligious freedom the Protestant clergy were everywhere driven fromtheir parsonages, Fellows and scholars were turned out of TrinityCollege, and the French envoy, the Count of Avaux, dared even to proposethat if any Protestant rising took place on the English descent, as wasexpected, it should be met by a general massacre of the Protestants whostill lingered in the districts which had submitted to James. To hiscredit the king shrank horror-struck from the proposal. "I cannot be socruel," he said, "as to cut their throats while they live peaceablyunder my government." "Mercy to Protestants," was the cold reply, "iscruelty to Catholics."[Sidenote: The Revolution and the Monarchy.]The long agony of Londonderry was invaluable to England: it foiled theking's hopes of an invasion which would have roused a fresh civil war,and gave the new Government time to breathe. Time was indeed sorelyneeded. Through the proscription and bloodshed of the new Irish ruleWilliam was forced to look helplessly on. The best troops in the armywhich had been mustered at Hounslow had been sent with Marlborough tothe Sambre, and the political embarrassments which grew up around thenew Government made it impossible to spare a man of those who remainedat home. The great ends of the Revolution were indeed secured, evenamidst the confusion and intrigue which we shall have to describe, bythe common consent of all. On the great questions of civil liberty Whigand Tory were now at one. The Declaration of Rights was turned into theBill of Rights by the Convention which had now become a Parliament, andthe passing of this measure in 1689 restored to the monarchy thecharacter which it had lost under the Tudors and the Stuarts. The rightof the people through its representatives to depose the king, to changethe order of succession, and to set on the throne whom they would, wasnow established. All claim of Divine Right or hereditary rightindependent of the law was formally put an end to by the election ofWilliam and Mary. Since their day no English sovereign has been able toadvance any claim to the crown save a claim which rested on a particularclause in a particular Act of Parliament. William, Mary, and Anne, weresovereigns simply by virtue of the Bill of Rights. George the First andhis successors have been sovereigns solely by virtue of the Act ofSettlement. An English monarch is now as much the creature of an Act ofParliament as the pettiest tax-gatherer in his realm.[Sidenote: Taxation and the Army.]Nor was the older character of the kingship alone restored. The olderconstitution returned with it. Bitter experience had taught England theneed of restoring to the Parliament its absolute power over taxation.The grant of revenue for life to the last two kings had been the secretof their anti-national policy, and the first act of the new legislaturewas to restrict the grant of the royal revenue to a term of four years.William was bitterly galled by the provision. "The gentlemen of Englandtrusted King James," he said, "who was an enemy of their religion andtheir laws, and they will not trust me, by whom their religion and theirlaws have been preserved." But the only change brought about in theParliament by this burst of royal anger was a resolve henceforth to makethe vote of supplies an annual one, a resolve which, in spite of theslight changes introduced by the next Tory Parliament, soon became aninvariable rule. A change of almost as great importance established thecontrol of Parliament over the army. The hatred to a standing army whichhad begun under Cromwell had only deepened under James; but with theContinental war the existence of an army was a necessity. As yet howeverit was a force which had no legal existence. The soldier was simply anordinary subject; there were no legal means of punishing strictlymilitary offences or of providing for military discipline: and theassumed power of billeting soldiers in private houses had been takenaway by the law. The difficulty both of Parliament and the army was metby a Mutiny Act. The powers requisite for discipline in the army wereconferred by Parliament on its officers, and provision was made for thepay of the force, but both pay and disciplinary powers were granted onlyfor a single year.[Sidenote: Parliament and the Revolution.]The Mutiny Act, like the grant of supplies, has remained annual eversince the Revolution; and as it is impossible for the State to existwithout supplies or for the army to exist without discipline and pay theannual assembly of Parliament has become a matter of absolute necessity.The greatest constitutional change which our history has witnessed wasthus brought about in an indirect but perfectly efficient way. Thedangers which experience had lately shown lay in the Parliament itselfwere met with far less skill. Under Charles the Second England had seena Parliament, which had been returned in a moment of reaction,maintained without fresh election for eighteen years. A Triennial Billwhich limited the duration of a Parliament to three was passed withlittle opposition, but fell before the dislike and veto of William. Tocounteract the influence which a king might obtain by crowding theCommons with officials proved a yet harder task. A Place Bill, whichexcluded all persons in the employment of the State from a seat inParliament, was defeated, and wisely defeated, in the Lords. The moderncourse of providing against a pressure from the Court or theadministration by excluding all minor officials, but of preserving thehold of Parliament over the great officers of State by admitting theminto its body, seems as yet to have occurred to nobody. It is equallystrange that while vindicating its right of Parliamentary control overthe public revenue and the army the Bill of Rights should have left byits silence the control of trade to the Crown. It was only a few yearslater, in the discussions on the charter granted to the East IndiaCompany, that the Houses silently claimed and obtained the right ofregulating English commerce.[Sidenote: The Toleration Act.]The religious results of the Revolution were hardly less weighty thanthe political. In the common struggle against Catholicism Churchman andNonconformist had found themselves, as we have seen, strangely at one;and schemes of Comprehension became suddenly popular. But with the fallof James the union of the two bodies abruptly ceased; and theestablishment of a Presbyterian Church in Scotland, together with the"rabbling" of the Episcopalian clergy in its western shires, revived theold bitterness of the clergy towards the dissidents. The Convocationrejected the scheme of the Latitudinarians for such modifications of thePrayer-Book as would render possible a return of the Nonconformists, anda Comprehension Bill, which was introduced into Parliament, failed topass in spite of the king's strenuous support. William's attempt topartially admit Dissenters to civil equality by a repeal of theCorporation Act proved equally fruitless. Active persecution howeverhad now become distasteful to all; the pledge of religious liberty givento the Nonconformists to ensure their aid in the Revolution had to beredeemed; and the passing of a Toleration Act in 1689 practicallyestablished freedom of worship. Whatever the religious effect of thisfailure of the Latitudinarian schemes may have been its political effecthas been of the highest value. At no time had the Church been so strongor so popular as at the Revolution, and the reconciliation of theNonconformists would have doubled its strength. It is doubtful whetherthe disinclination to all political change which has characterised itduring the last two hundred years would have been affected by such achange; but it is certain that the power of opposition which it haswielded would have been enormously increased. As it was, the TolerationAct established a group of religious bodies whose religious oppositionto the Church forced them to support the measures of progress which theChurch opposed. With religious forces on the one side and on the otherEngland has escaped the great stumbling-block in the way of nationswhere the cause of religion has become identified with that of politicalreaction.[Sidenote: The Revolution and the Church.]A secession from within its own ranks weakened the Church still more.The doctrine of Divine Right had a strong hold on the body of the clergythough they had been driven from their other favourite doctrine ofpassive obedience, and the requirement of an oath of allegiance to thenew sovereigns from all persons exercising public functions was resentedas an intolerable wrong by almost every parson. The whole bench ofbishops resolved, though to no purpose, that Parliament had no right toimpose such an oath on the clergy. Sancroft, the Archbishop ofCanterbury, with a few prelates and a large number of the higher clergyabsolutely refused the oath when it was imposed, treated all who took itas schismatics, and on their deprivation by Act of Parliament regardedthemselves and their adherents, who were known as Nonjurors, as the onlymembers of the true Church of England. The bulk of the clergy bowed tonecessity, but their bitterness against the new Government was fannedinto a flame by the religious policy announced in this assertion of thesupremacy of Parliament over the Church, and the deposition of bishopsby an act of the legislature. It was fanned into yet fiercer flame bythe choice of successors to the nonjuring prelates. The new bishops weremen of learning and piety, but they were for the most partLatitudinarians and some of them Whigs. Tillotson, the new Archbishop ofCanterbury, was the foremost theologian of the school of Chillingworthand Hales. Burnet, the new bishop of Salisbury, was as liberal asTillotson in religion and more liberal in politics. It was indeed onlyamong Whigs and Latitudinarians that William and William's successorscould find friends in the ranks of the clergy; and it was to these thatthey were driven with a few breaks here and there to entrust all thehigher offices of the Church. The result was a severance between thehigher dignitaries and the mass of the clergy which broke the strengthof the Church. From the time of William to the time of George the Thirdits fiercest strife was waged within its own ranks. But the resentmentat the measure which brought this strife about already added to thedifficulties which William had to encounter.[Sidenote: William and the Parliament.]Yet greater difficulties arose from the temper of his Parliament. In theCommons, chosen as they had been in the first moment of revolutionaryenthusiasm, the bulk of the members were Whigs, and their first aim wasto redress the wrongs which the Whig party had suffered during the lasttwo reigns. The attainder of Lord Russell was reversed. The judgmentsagainst Sidney, Cornish, and Alice Lisle were annulled. In spite of theopinion of the judges that the sentence on Titus Oates had been againstlaw the Lords refused to reverse it, but even Oates received a pardonand a pension. The Whigs however wanted not merely the redress of wrongsbut the punishment of the wrong-doers. Whig and Tory had been unitedindeed by the tyranny of James; both parties had shared in theRevolution, and William had striven to prolong their union by joiningthe leaders of both in his first Ministry. He named the Tory Earl ofDanby Lord President, made the Whig Earl of Shrewsbury Secretary ofState, and gave the Privy Seal to Lord Halifax, a trimmer between theone party and the other. But save in a moment of common oppression orcommon danger union was impossible. The Whigs clamoured for thepunishment of Tories who had joined in the illegal acts of Charles andof James, and refused to pass the Bill of General Indemnity whichWilliam laid before them. William on the other hand was resolved that nobloodshed or proscription should follow the revolution which had placedhim on the throne. His temper was averse from persecution; he had nogreat love for either of the battling parties; and above all he saw thatinternal strife would be fatal to the effective prosecution of the war.[Sidenote: The Jacobites.]While the cares of his new throne were chaining him to England theconfederacy of which he was the guiding spirit was proving too slow andtoo loosely compacted to cope with the swift and resolute movements ofFrance. The armies of Lewis had fallen back within their own borders,but only to turn fiercely at bay. Even the junction of the English andDutch fleets failed to assure them the mastery of the seas. The Englishnavy was paralysed by the corruption which prevailed in the publicservice, as well as by the sloth and incapacity of its commander. Theservices of Admiral Herbert at the Revolution had been rewarded with theearldom of Torrington and the command of the fleet; but his indolencesuffered the seas to be swept by French privateers, and his want ofseamanship was shown in an indecisive engagement with a French squadronin Bantry Bay. Meanwhile Lewis was straining every nerve to win thecommand of the Channel; the French dockyards were turning out ship aftership, and the galleys of the Mediterranean fleet were brought round toreinforce the fleet at Brest. A French victory off the English coastwould have brought serious political danger; for the reaction of popularfeeling which had begun in favour of James had been increased by thepressure of the war, by the taxation, by the expulsion of the Nonjurorsand the discontent of the clergy, by the panic of the Tories at thespirit of vengeance which broke out among the triumphant Whigs, andabove all by the presence of James in Ireland. A new party, that of theJacobites or adherents of King James, was forming around the Nonjurors;and it was feared that a Jacobite rising would follow the appearance ofa French fleet on the coast.[Sidenote: Schomberg in Ireland.]In such a state of affairs William judged rightly that to yield to theWhig thirst for vengeance would have been to ruin his cause. Hedissolved the Parliament, which had refused to pass a Bill of Indemnityfor all political offences, and called a new one to meet in March. Theresult of the elections proved that William had only expressed thegeneral temper of the nation. In the new Parliament the bulk of themembers proved Tories. The boroughs had been alienated from the Whigs bytheir refusal to pass the Indemnity, and their desire to secure theCorporations for their own party by driving from them all who had takenpart in the Tory misgovernment under Charles or James. In the countiesthe discontent of the clergy told as heavily against the Whigs; andparson after parson led his flock in a body to the poll. The change oftemper in the Parliament necessarily brought about a change among theking's advisers. William accepted the resignation of the more violentWhigs among his counsellors and placed Danby at the head of affairs; andin May the Houses gave their assent to the Act of Grace. The king's aimin his sudden change of front was not only to meet the change in thenational spirit, but to secure a momentary lull in English faction whichwould suffer him to strike at the rebellion in Ireland. While James wasking in Dublin the attempt to crush treason at home was a hopeless one;and so urgent was the danger, so precious every moment in the presentjuncture of affairs, that William could trust no one to bring the workas sharply to an end as was needful save himself. In the autumn of theyear 1689 the Duke of Schomberg, an exiled Huguenot who had followedWilliam in his expedition to England and was held to be one of the mostskilful captains of the time, had been sent with a small force to Ulsterto take advantage of the panic which had followed the relief ofLondonderry. James indeed was already talking of flight, and looked uponthe game as hopeless. But the spirit of the Irish people rose quicklyfrom their despair, and the duke's landing roused the whole nation to afresh enthusiasm. The ranks of the Irish army were filled up at once,and James was able to face the duke at Drogheda with a force double thatof his opponent. Schomberg, whose men were all raw recruits whom it washardly possible to trust at such odds in the field, did all that waspossible when he entrenched himself at Dundalk and held his ground in acamp where pestilence swept off half his numbers.[Sidenote: Battle of the Boyne.]Winter at last parted the two armies, and during the next six monthsJames, whose treasury was utterly exhausted, strove to fill it by acoinage of brass money while his soldiers subsisted by sheer plunder.William meanwhile was toiling hard on the other side of the Channel tobring the Irish war to an end. Schomberg was strengthened during thewinter with men and stores, and when the spring came his force reachedthirty thousand men. Lewis too felt the importance of the comingstruggle. Seven thousand picked Frenchmen under the Count of Lauzun weredespatched to reinforce the army of James, but they had hardly arrivedwhen William himself landed at Carrickfergus and pushed rapidly with hiswhole army to the south. His columns soon caught sight of the Irishforces, hardly exceeding twenty thousand men in number but postedstrongly behind the Boyne. Lauzun had hoped by falling back on Dublin toprolong a defensive war, but retreat was now impossible. "I am glad tosee you, gentlemen," William cried with a burst of delight; "and if youescape me now the fault will be mine." Early next morning, the first ofJuly 1690, the whole English army plunged into the river. The Irishfoot, who at first fought well, broke in a sudden panic as soon as thepassage of the river was effected, but the horse made so gallant a standthat Schomberg fell in repulsing its charge and for a time the Englishcentre was held in check. With the arrival of William however at thehead of his left wing all was over. James, who had throughout beenstriving to secure the withdrawal of his troops to the nearest defilerather than frankly to meet William's onset, abandoned his troops asthey fell back in retreat upon Dublin, and took ship at Kinsale forFrance.[Sidenote: Irish War.]But though James had fled in despair, and though the beaten army wasforced by William's pursuit to abandon the capital, it was stillresolute to fight. The incapacity of the Stuart sovereign moved thescorn even of his followers. "Change kings with us," an Irish officerreplied to an Englishman who taunted him with the panic of the Boyne,"change kings with us and we will fight you again." They did better infighting without a king. The French indeed withdrew scornfully from therouted army as it turned at bay beneath the walls of Limerick. "Do youcall these ramparts?" sneered Lauzun: "the English will need no cannon;they may batter them down with roasted apples." But twenty thousandIrish soldiers remained with Sarsfield, a brave and skilful officer whohad seen service in England and abroad; and his daring surprise of theEnglish ammunition train, his repulse of a desperate attempt to stormthe town, and the approach of winter forced William to raise the siege.The course of the war abroad recalled him to England, but he was hardlygone when a new turn was given to the struggle by one who was quietlyproving himself a master in the art of war. Churchill, rewarded for hisopportune desertion of James with the earldom of Marlborough, had beenrecalled from Flanders to command a division which landed in the southof Ireland. Only a few days remained before the operations wereinterrupted by the coming of winter, but the few days were turned togood account. The two ports by which alone Ireland could receivesupplies from France fell into English hands. Cork, with five thousandmen behind its walls, was taken in forty-eight hours. Kinsale a few dayslater shared the fate of Cork. Winter indeed left Connaught and thegreater part of Munster in Irish hands, the French force remaineduntouched, and the coming of a new French general, St. Ruth, with armsand supplies encouraged the insurgents. But the summer of 1691 hadhardly begun when Ginkell, the new English general, by his seizure ofAthlone forced on a battle with the combined French and Irish forces atAughrim, in which St. Ruth fell on the field and his army was utterlybroken.[Sidenote: Ireland conquered.]The defeat at Aughrim left Limerick alone in its revolt, and in OctoberSarsfield bowed to the necessity of surrender. Two treaties were drawnup between the Irish and English generals. By the first it wasstipulated that the Catholics of Ireland should enjoy such privileges inthe exercise of their religion as were consistent with law, or as theyhad enjoyed in the reign of Charles the Second. The Crown pledged itselfalso to summon a Parliament as soon as possible, and to endeavour toprocure to the good Roman Catholics such further security in thatparticular as "may preserve them from any disturbance upon the accountof the said religion." By the military treaty those of Sarsfield'ssoldiers who would were suffered to follow him to France; and tenthousand men, the whole of his force, chose exile rather than life in aland where all hope of national freedom was lost. When the wild cry ofthe women who stood watching their departure was hushed the silence ofdeath settled down upon Ireland. For a hundred years the countryremained at peace. But the peace was a peace of despair. No Englishmanwho loves what is noble in the English temper can tell without sorrowand shame the story of that time of guilt. The work of oppression, it istrue, was done not directly by England but by the English settlers inIreland; and the cruelty of their rule sprang in great measure from thesense of danger and the atmosphere of panic in which the Protestantslived. But if thoughts such as these relieve the guilt of those whooppressed they leave the fact of oppression as dark as before. The mostterrible legal tyranny under which a nation has ever groaned avenged therising under Tyrconnell. The conquered people, in Swift's bitter wordsof contempt, became "hewers of wood and drawers of water" to theirconquerors. Such as the work was, however, it was thoroughly done.Though local risings of these serfs perpetually spread terror among theEnglish settlers in Ireland, all dream of a national revolt passed away.Till the very eve of the French Revolution Ireland ceased to be a sourceof political danger and anxiety to England.[Sidenote: French Descent on England.]Short as the struggle of Ireland had been it had served Lewis well, forwhile William was busy at the Boyne a series of brilliant successes wasrestoring the fortunes of France. In Flanders the Duke of Luxembourg wonthe victory of Fleurus. In Italy Marshal Catinat defeated the Duke ofSavoy. A success of even greater moment, the last victory which Francewas fated to win at sea, placed for an instant the very throne ofWilliam in peril. William never showed a cooler courage than in quittingEngland to fight James in Ireland at a moment when the Jacobites wereonly looking for the appearance of a French fleet on the coast to risein revolt. The French minister in fact hurried the fleet to sea in thehope of detaining William in England by a danger at home; and he hadhardly set out for Ireland when Tourville, the French admiral, appearedin the Channel with strict orders to fight. Orders as strict had beensent to the allied fleets to engage even at the risk of defeat; and whenTourville was met on the 30th of June 1690 by the English and Dutchfleet at Beachy Head the Dutch division at once engaged. Though utterlyoutnumbered it fought stubbornly in hope of Herbert's aid; but Herbert,whether from cowardice or treason, looked idly on while his allies werecrushed, and withdrew with the English ships at nightfall to seekshelter in the Thames. The danger was as great as the shame, forTourville's victory left him master of the Channel and his presence offthe coast of Devon invited the Jacobites to revolt. But whatever thediscontent of Tories and Nonjurors against William might be all signs ofit vanished with the landing of the French. The burning of Teignmouth byTourville's sailors called the whole coast to arms; and the news of theBoyne put an end to all dreams of a rising in favour of James.[Sidenote: Intrigues in England.]The natural reaction against a cause which looked for foreign aid gave anew strength for the moment to William in England; but ill luck stillhung around the Grand Alliance. So urgent was the need for his presenceabroad that William left as we have seen his work in Ireland undone, andcrossed in the spring of 1691 to Flanders. It was the first time sincethe days of Henry the Eighth that an English king had appeared on theContinent at the head of an English army. But the slowness of the alliesagain baffled William's hopes. He was forced to look on with a smallarmy while a hundred thousand Frenchmen closed suddenly around Mons, thestrongest fortress of the Netherlands, and made themselves masters of itin the presence of Lewis. The humiliation was great, and for the momentall trust in William's fortune faded away. In England the blow was feltmore heavily than elsewhere. The Jacobite hopes which had been crushedby the indignation at Tourville's descent woke up to a fresh life.Leading Tories, such as Lord Clarendon and Lord Dartmouth, openedcommunications with James; and some of the leading Whigs with the Earlof Shrewsbury at their head, angered at what they regarded as William'singratitude, followed them in their course. In Lord Marlborough's mindthe state of affairs raised hopes of a double treason. His design was tobring about a revolt which would drive William from the throne withoutreplacing James on it, a revolt which would in fact give the crown tohis daughter Anne whose affection for Marlborough's wife would place thereal government of England in Churchill's hands. A yet greater dangerlay in the treason of Admiral Russell who had succeeded Torrington incommand of the fleet.[Sidenote: Battle of La Hogue.]Russell's defection would have removed the one obstacle to a new attemptwhich James was resolved to make for the recovery of his throne andwhich Lewis had been brought to support. James had never wavered fromhis design of returning to England at the head of a foreign force. Heabandoned Ireland as soon as his hopes of finding such a force therevanished at the Boyne; and from that moment he had sought a base ofinvasion in France. Lewis was the more willing to make the trial thatthe pressure of the war had left few troops in England. So certain washe of success that the future ambassador to the court of James wasalready nominated, and a treaty of commerce sketched between France andEngland. In the beginning of 1692 an army of thirty thousand troops wasquartered in Normandy in readiness for a descent on the English coast.Nearly a half of this force was composed of the Irish regiments who hadfollowed Sarsfield into exile after the surrender of Limerick.Transports were provided for their passage, and Tourville was ordered tocover it with the French fleet at Brest. Though Russell had twice asmany ships as his opponent the belief in his purpose of betrayingWilliam's cause was so strong that Lewis ordered Tourville to engage theallied fleets at any disadvantage. But whatever Russell's intrigues mayhave meant he was no Herbert. All he would promise was to keep his fleetout of the way of hindering a landing. But should Tourville engage, hewould promise nothing. "Do not think I will let the French triumph overus in our own seas," he warned his Jacobite correspondents. "If I meetthem I will fight them, even though King James were on board." When theallied fleet, which had been ordered to the Norman coast, met the Frenchoff the heights of Barfleur his fierce attack proved Russell true to hisword. Tourville's fifty vessels were no match for the ninety ships ofthe allies, and after five hours of a brave struggle the French wereforced to fly along the rocky coast of the Cotentin. Twenty-two of theirvessels reached St. Malo; thirteen anchored with Tourville in the baysof Cherbourg and La Hogue; but their pursuers were soon upon them, andin a bold attack the English boats burned ship after ship under the eyesof the French army.[Sidenote: The turn of the War.]All dread of the invasion was at once at an end; and the throne ofWilliam was secured by the detection and suppression of the Jacobiteconspiracy at home which the invasion was intended to support. Thebattle of La Hogue was a death-blow to the project of a Stuartrestoration by help of foreign arms. Henceforth English Jacobitism wouldhave to battle unaided against the throne of the Revolution. But theoverthrow of the Jacobite hopes was the least result of the victory.France ceased from that moment to exist as a great naval power; forthough her fleet was soon recruited to its former strength theconfidence of her sailors was lost, and not even Tourville venturedagain to tempt in battle the fortune of the seas. A new hope too dawnedon the Grand Alliance. The spell of French triumph was broken. On landindeed the French still held their old mastery. Namur, one of thestrongest fortresses in Europe, surrendered to Lewis a few days afterthe battle of La Hogue. An inroad into Dauphine failed to rouse theHuguenots to revolt, and the Duke of Luxembourg maintained the glory ofthe French arms by a victory over William at Steinkirk. But the battlewas a useless butchery in which the conquerors lost as many men as theconquered. From that moment France felt herself disheartened andexhausted by the vastness of her efforts. The public misery was extreme."The country," Fenelon wrote frankly to Lewis, "is a vast hospital." Thetide too of the war began to turn. In 1693 the campaign of Lewis in theNetherlands proved a fruitless one, and Luxembourg was hardly able tobeat off the fierce attack of William at Neerwinden. For the first timein his long career of prosperity therefore Lewis bent his pride to seekpeace at the sacrifice of his conquests, and though the effort was avain one it told that the daring hopes of French ambition were at an endand that the work of the Grand Alliance was practically done.[Sidenote: The Sovereignty of the Commons.]Its final triumph however was in great measure brought about by a changewhich now passed over the face of English politics. In outer seeming theRevolution of 1688 had only transferred the sovereignty over Englandfrom James to William and Mary. In actual fact it had given a powerfuland decisive impulse to the great constitutional progress which wastransferring the sovereignty from the king to the House of Commons. Fromthe moment when its sole right to tax the nation was established by theBill of Rights, and when its own resolve settled the practice ofgranting none but annual supplies to the Crown, the House of Commonsbecame the supreme power in the State. It was impossible permanently tosuspend its sittings or in the long run to oppose its will when eithercourse must end in leaving the Government penniless, in breaking up thearmy and navy, and in suspending the public service. But though theconstitutional change was complete the machinery of government was farfrom having adapted itself to the new conditions of political life whichsuch a change brought about. However powerful the will of the House ofCommons might be it had no means of bringing its will directly to bearupon the conduct of public affairs. The Ministers who had charge of themwere not its servants, but the servants of the Crown; it was from theking that they looked for direction, and to the king that they heldthemselves responsible. By impeachment or more indirect means theCommons could force a king to remove a Minister who contradicted theirwill; but they had no constitutional power to replace the fallenstatesman by a Minister who would carry out their will.[Sidenote: Lord Sunderland.]The result was the growth of a temper in the Lower House which droveWilliam and his Ministers to despair. It became as corrupt, as jealousof power, as fickle in its resolves and factious in spirit as bodiesalways become whose consciousness of the possession of power isuntempered by a corresponding consciousness of the practicaldifficulties or the moral responsibilities of the power which theypossess. It grumbled at the ill-success of the war, at the suffering ofthe merchants, at the discontent of the Churchmen; and it blamed theCrown and its Ministers for all at which it grumbled. But it was hard tofind out what policy or measures it would have preferred. Its moodchanged, as William bitterly complained, with every hour. His own holdover it grew less day by day. It was only through great pressure that hesucceeded in defeating by a majority of two a Place Bill which wouldhave rendered all his servants and Ministers incapable of sitting in theCommons. He was obliged to use his veto to defeat a Triennial Billwhich, as he believed, would have destroyed what little stability ofpurpose there was in the present Parliament. The Houses were in factwithout the guidance of recognized leaders, without adequateinformation, and destitute of that organization out of which alone adefinite policy can come. Nothing better proves the inborn politicalcapacity of the English mind than that it should at once have found asimple and effective solution of such a difficulty as this. The creditof the solution belongs to a man whose political character was of thelowest type. Robert, Earl of Sunderland, had been a Minister in thelater days of Charles the Second; and he had remained Minister throughalmost all the reign of James. He had held office at last only bycompliance with the worst tyranny of his master and by a feignedconversion to the Roman Catholic faith; but the ruin of James was nosooner certain than he had secured pardon and protection from William bythe betrayal of the master to whom he had sacrificed his conscience andhis honour. Since the Revolution Sunderland had striven only to escapepublic observation in a country retirement, but at this crisis he camesecretly forward to bring his unequalled sagacity to the aid of theking. His counsel was to recognize practically the new power of theCommons by choosing the Ministers of the Crown exclusively from amongthe members of the party which was strongest in the Lower House.[Sidenote: The New Ministerial System.]As yet no Ministry in the modern sense of the term had existed. Eachgreat officer of State, Treasurer or Secretary or Lord Privy Seal, hadin theory been independent of his fellow-officers; each was the "King'sservant" and responsible for the discharge of his special duties to theking alone. From time to time one Minister, like Clarendon, might towerabove the rest and give a general direction to the whole course ofgovernment, but the predominance was merely personal and neverpermanent; and even in such a case there were colleagues who were readyto oppose or even impeach the statesman who overshadowed them. It wascommon for a king to choose or dismiss a single Minister without anycommunication with the rest; and so far was even William from aiming atministerial unity that he had striven to reproduce in the Cabinet itselfthe balance of parties which prevailed outside it. Sunderland's planaimed at replacing these independent Ministers by a homogeneousMinistry, chosen from the same party, representing the same sentiments,and bound together for common action by a sense of responsibility andloyalty to the party to which it belonged. Not only was such a planlikely to secure a unity of administration which had been unknown tillthen, but it gave an organization to the House of Commons which it hadnever had before. The Ministers who were representatives of the majorityof its members became the natural leaders of the House. Small factionswere drawn together into the two great parties which supported oropposed the Ministry of the Crown. Above all it brought about in thesimplest possible way the solution of the problem which had so longvexed both Kings and Commons. The new Ministers ceased in all but nameto be the king's servants. They became simply an Executive Committeerepresenting the will of the majority of the House of Commons, andcapable of being easily set aside by it and replaced by a similarCommittee whenever the balance of power shifted from one side of theHouse to the other.[Sidenote: The Junto.]Such was the origin of that system of representative government whichhas gone on from Sunderland's day to our own. But though William showedhis own political genius in understanding and adopting Sunderland'splan, it was only slowly and tentatively that he ventured to carry itout in practice. In spite of the temporary reaction Sunderland believedthat the balance of political power was really on the side of the Whigs.Not only were they the natural representatives of the principles of theRevolution, and the supporters of the war, but they stood far abovetheir opponents in parliamentary and administrative talent. At theirhead stood a group of statesmen whose close union in thought and actiongained them the name of the Junto. Russell, as yet the most prominent ofthese, was the victor of La Hogue; John Somers was an advocate who hadsprung into fame by his defence of the Seven Bishops; Lord Wharton wasknown as the most dexterous and unscrupulous of party managers; andMontague was fast making a reputation as the ablest of Englishfinanciers. In spite of such considerations however it is doubtfulwhether William would have thrown himself into the hands of a purelyWhig Ministry but for the attitude which the Tories took towards thewar. Exhausted as France was the war still languished and the alliesstill failed to win a single victory. Meanwhile English trade was allbut ruined by the French privateers and the nation stood aghast at thegrowth of taxation. The Tories, always cold in their support of theGrand Alliance, now became eager for peace. The Whigs on the other handremained resolute in their support of the war.[Sidenote: Bank of England.]William, in whose mind the contest with France was the first object, wasthus driven slowly to follow Sunderland's advice. Already in 1694 indeedMontague established his political position and weakened that of theTory Ministers by his success in a great financial measure which at oncerelieved the pressure of taxation and added strength to the newmonarchy. The war could be kept up only by loans: and loans were stillraised in England by personal appeal to a few London goldsmiths in whosehands men placed money for investment. But the bankruptcies whichfollowed the closing of the Exchequer by the Cabal had shaken publicconfidence in the goldsmiths, while the dread of a restoration of Jamesmade these capitalists appear shy of the Ministers' appeals for aid.Money therefore could only be raised in scanty quantities and at a heavyloss. In this emergency Montague came forward with a plan which had beenpreviously suggested by a Scotchman, William Paterson, for the creationof a National Bank such as already existed in Holland and in Genoa.While serving as an ordinary bank for the supply of capital tocommercial enterprises the Bank of England, as the new institution wascalled, was in reality an instrument for procuring loans from thepeople at large by the formal pledge of the State to repay the moneyadvanced on the demand of the lender. For this purpose a loan ofL1,200,000 was thrown open to public subscription; and the subscribersto it were formed into a chartered company in whose hands thenegotiation of all after loans was placed. The plan turned out a perfectsuccess. In ten days the list of subscribers was full. A new source ofpower revealed itself in this discovery of the resources afforded by thenational credit and the national wealth; and the rapid growth of theNational Debt, as the mass of these loans to the State came to becalled, gave a new security against the return of the Stuarts whosefirst work would have been the repudiation of the claims of the lendersor as they were termed the "fundholders."[Sidenote: The Whig Ministry.]The evidence of the public credit gave strength to William abroad as athome. In 1694 indeed the army of 90,000 men which he commanded in theNetherlands did no more than hold the French successfully at bay; butthe English fleet rode triumphant in the Channel, ravaged and alarmedthe coast of France, and foiled by its pressure the attack of a Frencharmy on Barcelona. The brighter aspect of affairs abroad coincided witha new unity of action at home. The change which Sunderland counselledwas quietly carried out. One by one the Tory Ministers had been replacedby members of the Junto. Russell went to the Admiralty; Somers wasnamed Lord Keeper; Shrewsbury, Secretary of State; Montague, Chancellorof the Exchequer. Even before this change was completed its effect wasfelt. The House of Commons took a new tone. The Whig majority of itsmembers, united and disciplined, moved quietly under the direction oftheir natural leaders, the Whig Ministers of the Crown. It was thiswhich enabled William to face the shock which was given to his positionby the death of Queen Mary at the end of 1694. It had been providedindeed that on the death of either sovereign the survivor should retainthe throne; but the renewed attacks of the Tories under Nottingham andHalifax on the war and the Bank showed what fresh hopes had been raisedby William's lonely position. The Parliament however, whom the king hadjust conciliated by assenting at last to the Triennial Bill, wentsteadily with the Ministry; and its fidelity was rewarded by triumphabroad. In September 1695 the Alliance succeeded for the first time inwinning a great triumph over France in the capture of Namur. The kingskilfully took advantage of his victory to call a new Parliament, andits members at once showed their temper by a vigorous support of themeasures necessary for the prosecution of the war. The Houses indeedwere no mere tools in William's hands. They forced him to resume theprodigal grants of lands which he had made to his Dutch favourites, andto remove his Ministers in Scotland who had aided in a wild project fora Scotch colony on the Isthmus of Darien. They claimed a right to namemembers of the new Board of Trade which was established in 1696 for theregulation of commercial matters. They rejected a proposal, neverhenceforth to be revived, for a censorship of the Press. But there wasno factious opposition. So strong was the Ministry that Montague wasenabled to face the general distress which was caused for the moment bya reform of the currency, which had been reduced by clipping to far lessthan its nominal value, and although the financial embarrassmentscreated by the currency reform hindered any vigorous measures abroadWilliam was able to hold the French at bay.[Sidenote: The Spanish Succession.]But the war was fast drawing to a close. The Catholic powers in theGrand Alliance were already in revolt against William's supremacy asthey had been in revolt against that of Lewis. In 1696 the Popesucceeded in detaching Savoy from the league and Lewis was enabled totransfer his Italian army to the Low Countries. But France was nowsimply fighting to secure more favourable terms, and William, though heheld that "the only way of treating with France is with our swords inour hands," was almost as eager as Lewis for a peace. The defection ofSavoy made it impossible to carry out the original aim of the Alliance,that of forcing France back to its position at the Treaty of Westphalia,and a new question was drawing every day nearer, the question of thesuccession to the Spanish throne. The death of the King of Spain,Charles the Second, was now known to be at hand. With him ended the maleline of the Austrian princes who for two hundred years had occupied theSpanish throne. How strangely Spain had fallen from its high estate inEurope the wars of Lewis had abundantly shown, but so vast was theextent of its empire, so enormous the resources which still remained toit, that under a vigorous ruler men believed its old power would at oncereturn. Its sovereign was still master of some of the noblest provincesof the Old World and the New, of Spain itself, of the Milanese, ofNaples and Sicily, of the Netherlands, of Southern America, of the nobleislands of the Spanish Main. To add such a dominion as this to thedominion either of Lewis or of the Emperor would be to undo at a blowthe work of European independence which William had wrought; and it waswith a view to prevent either of these results that William resolved tofree his hands by a conclusion of the war.[Sidenote: Peace of Ryswick.]In May negotiations were opened at Ryswick; the obstacles thrown in theway of an accommodation by Spain and the Empire were set aside in aprivate negotiation between William and Lewis; and peace was finallysigned in October 1697. In spite of failure and defeat in the fieldWilliam's policy had won. The victories of France remained barren in theface of a united Europe; and her exhaustion forced her for the firsttime since Richelieu's day to consent to a disadvantageous peace. On theside of the Empire France withdrew from every annexation save that ofStrassburg which she had made since the Treaty of Nimeguen, andStrassburg would have been restored but for the unhappy delays of theGerman negotiators. To Spain Lewis restored Luxemburg and all theconquests he had made during the war in the Netherlands. The Duke ofLorraine was replaced in his dominions. A far more important provisionof the peace pledged Lewis to an abandonment of the Stuart cause and arecognition of William as King of England. For Europe in general thepeace of Ryswick was little more than a truce. But for England it wasthe close of a long and obstinate struggle and the opening of a new aeraof political history. It was the final and decisive defeat of theconspiracy which had gone on between Lewis and the Stuarts ever sincethe Treaty of Dover, the conspiracy to turn England into a RomanCatholic country and into a dependency of France. But it was even morethan this. It was the definite establishment of England as the centre ofEuropean resistance against all attempts to overthrow the balance ofpower.[Sidenote: William's aims.]In leaving England face to face with France the Treaty of Ryswick gave anew turn to the policy of William. Hitherto he had aimed at saving thebalance of European power by the joint action of England and the rest ofthe European states against France. He now saw a means of securing whatthat action had saved by the co-operation of France and the two greatnaval powers. In his new course we see the first indication of thattriple alliance of France, England, and Holland, which formed the baseof Walpole's foreign policy, as well as of that common action of Englandand France which since the fall of Holland has so constantly recurred tothe dreams of English statesmen. Peace therefore was no sooner signedthan William by stately embassies and a series of secret negotiationsdrew nearer to France. It was in direct negotiation and co-operationwith Lewis that he aimed at bringing about a peaceful settlement of thequestion which threatened Europe with war. At this moment the claimantsof the Spanish succession were three: the French Dauphin, a son of theSpanish king's elder sister; the Electoral Prince of Bavaria, a grandsonof his younger sister; and the Emperor, who was a son of Charles's aunt.In strict law--if there had been any law really applicable to thematter--the claim of the last was the strongest of the three; for theclaim of the Dauphin was barred by an express renunciation of all rightto the succession at his mother's marriage with Lewis XIV., arenunciation which had been ratified at the Treaty of the Pyrenees; anda similar renunciation barred the claim of the Bavarian candidate. Theclaim of the Emperor was more remote in blood, but it was barred by norenunciation at all. William however was as resolute in the interests ofEurope to repulse the claim of the Emperor as to repulse that of Lewis;and it was the consciousness that the Austrian succession was inevitableif the war continued and Spain remained a member of the Grand Alliance,in arms against France and leagued with the Emperor, which made himsuddenly conclude the Peace of Ryswick.[Sidenote: The first Partition Treaty.]Had England and Holland shared William's temper he would have insistedon the succession of the Electoral Prince to the whole Spanishdominions. But both were weary of war, and of the financial distresswhich war had brought with it. In England the peace of Ryswick was atonce followed by the reduction of the army at the demand of the House ofCommons to ten thousand men; and a clamour had already begun for thedisbanding even of these. It was necessary therefore to bribe the tworival claimants to a waiver of their claims; and Lewis after somehesitation yielded to the counsels of his Ministers, and consented towaive his son's claims for such a bribe. The secret treaty between thethree powers, which was concluded in the summer of 1698, thus becamenecessarily a Partition Treaty. The succession of the Electoral Princeof Bavaria was recognized on condition of the cession by Spain of itsItalian possessions to his two rivals. The Milanese was to pass to theEmperor; the Two Sicilies, with the border province of Guipuzcoa, toFrance. But the arrangement was hardly concluded when the death of theBavarian prince in February 1699 made the Treaty waste paper. Austriaand France were left face to face; and a terrible struggle, in which thesuccess of either would be equally fatal to the independence of Europe,seemed unavoidable. The peril was the greater that the temper of bothEngland and Holland left William without the means of backing his policyby arms. The suffering which the war had caused to the merchant classand the pressure of the debt and taxation it entailed were waking everyday a more bitter resentment in the people of both countries. While thestruggle lasted the value of English exports had fallen from fourmillions a year to less than three, and the losses of ships and goods atsea had been enormous. Nor had the stress been less felt within therealm. The revenue from the post-office, a fair index to the generalwealth of the country, had fallen from seventy-six thousand tofifty-eight. With the restoration of peace indeed the energies of thecountry had quickly recovered from the shock. In the five years afterthe Peace of Ryswick the exports doubled themselves; themerchant-shipping was quadrupled; and the revenue of the post-officerose to eighty-two thousand pounds. But such a recovery only produced agreater disinclination to face again the sufferings of a renewed stateof war.[Sidenote: The second Partition Treaty.]The general discontent at the course of the war, the general anxiety topreserve the new gains of the peace, told alike on William and on theparty which had backed his policy. In England almost every one was seton two objects, the reduction of taxes and the disbanding of thestanding army. The war had raised the taxes from two millions a year tofour. It had bequeathed twenty millions of debt and a fresh six millionsof deficit. The standing army was still held to be the enemy of liberty,as it had been held under the Stuarts; and hardly any one realized thenew conditions of political life which had robbed its existence ofdanger to the State. The king however resisted desperately the proposalsfor its disbanding; for the maintenance of the army was all-importantfor the success of the negotiations he was carrying on. But his stubbornopposition only told against himself. Personally indeed the king stillremained an object of national gratitude; but his natural partiality tohis Dutch favourites, the confidence he gave to Sunderland, his cold andsullen demeanour, above all his endeavours to maintain the standingarmy, robbed him of popularity and of the strength which comes frompopularity. The negotiations too which he was carrying on were a secrethe could not reveal; and his prayers failed to turn the Parliament fromits purpose. The army and navy were ruthlessly cut down. How muchWilliam's hands were weakened by this reduction of forces and by thepeace-temper of England was shown by the Second Partition Treaty whichwas concluded in 1700 between the two maritime powers and France. Thedemand of Lewis that the Netherlands should be given to the Elector ofBavaria, whose political position would always leave him a puppet in theFrench king's hands, was indeed successfully resisted. Spain, theNetherlands, and the Indies were assigned to the second son of theEmperor, the Archduke Charles of Austria. But the whole of the Spanishterritories in Italy were now granted to France; and it was providedthat Milan should be exchanged for Lorraine, whose Duke was to besummarily transferred to the new Duchy. If the Emperor persisted in hisrefusal to come into the Treaty the share of his son was to pass toanother unnamed prince, who was probably the Duke of Savoy.[Sidenote: Fall of the Junto.]The Emperor, indifferent to the Archduke's personal interest, andanxious only to gain a new dominion in Italy for the House of Austria,stubbornly protested against this arrangement; but his protest was oflittle moment so long as Lewis and the two maritime powers held firmlytogether. The new Western Alliance indeed showed how wide its power wasfrom the first. The mediation of England and Holland, no longercounteracted by France, secured peace between the Emperor and the Turksin the Treaty of Carlowitz. The common action of the three powersstifled a strife between Holstein and Denmark which would have set NorthGermany on fire. William's European position indeed was more commandingthan ever. But his difficulties at home were increasing every day. Inspite of the defection of their supporters on the question of a standingarmy the Whig Ministry for some time retained fairly its hold on theHouses. But the elections for a new Parliament at the close of 1698showed the growth of a new temper in the nation. A Tory majority,pledged to peace as to a reduction of taxation and indifferent toforeign affairs, was returned to the House of Commons. The fourteenthousand men still retained in the army were at once cut down to seven.It was voted that William's Dutch guards should return to Holland. Itwas in vain that William begged for their retention as a personalfavour, that he threatened to leave England with them, and that the illeffect of this strife on his negotiations threw him into a fever. Evenbefore the elections he had warned the Dutch Pensionary that in anyfresh struggle England could be relied on only for naval aid. He wasforced to give way; and, as he expected, this open display of thepeace-temper of England told fatally on the resistance he had attemptedto the pretensions of France. He strove indeed to appease the Parliamentby calling for the resignation of Russell and Montague, the twoministers most hated by the Tories. But all seemed in vain. The Housesno sooner met in 1699 than the Tory majority attacked the Crown, passeda Bill for resuming estates granted to the Dutch favourites, andcondemned the Ministers as responsible for these grants. AgainSunderland had to intervene, and to press William to carry out thepolicy which had produced the Whig Ministry by its entire dismissal.Somers and his friends withdrew, and a new administration composed ofmoderate Tories, with Lords Rochester and Godolphin as its leadingmembers, took their place.[Sidenote: Accession of the Duke of Anjou.]The moment indeed was one in which the king needed at any price theco-operation of the Parliament. Spain had been stirred to bitterresentment as news of the Partition Treaty crept abroad. The Spaniardscared little whether a French or an Austrian prince sat on the throne ofCharles the Second, but their pride revolted against the dismembermentof the monarchy by the loss of its Italian dependencies. The nobles toodreaded the loss of their vast estates in Italy and of the lucrativeposts they held as governors of these dependencies. Even the dying kingshared the anger of his subjects. He hesitated only whether to leave hisdominions to the House of Austria or the House of Bourbon; but ineither case he was resolved to leave the whole. A will wrested from himby the factions which wrangled over his deathbed bequeathed at last thewhole monarchy of Spain to a grandson of Lewis, the Duke of Anjou, thesecond son of the Dauphin. It was doubtful indeed whether Lewis wouldsuffer his grandson to receive the crown. He was still a member of thatTriple Alliance on which for the last three years the peace of Europehad depended. The Treaty of Partition was so recent and the risk ofaccepting this bequest so great that Lewis would have hardly resolved onit but for his belief that the temper of England must necessarily renderWilliam's opposition a fruitless one. Never in fact had England been soaverse from war. So strong was the antipathy to William's policy thatmen openly approved the French king's course. Hardly any one in Englanddreaded the succession of a boy who, French as he was, would as theybelieved soon be turned into a Spaniard by the natural course of events.The succession of the Duke of Anjou was generally looked upon as farbetter than the increase of power which France would have derived fromthe cessions of the last treaty of Partition. The cession of theSicilies would have turned the Mediterranean, it was said, into a Frenchlake, and have ruined the English trade with the Levant, while thecession of Guipuzcoa and the annexation of the west coast of Spain,which was looked on as certain to follow, would have imperilled theAmerican trade and again raised France into a formidable power at sea.Backing all these considerations was the dread of losing by a contestwith Spain and its new king the lucrative trade with the Spanishcolonies. "It grieves me to the heart," William wrote bitterly, "thatalmost every one rejoices that France has preferred the Will to theTreaty." Astonished and angered as he was at his rival's breach offaith, he had no means of punishing it. In the opening of 1701 the Dukeof Anjou entered Madrid, and Lewis proudly boasted that henceforth therewere no Pyrenees.[Sidenote: Seizure of the Dutch Barrier.]The life-work of William seemed undone. He knew himself to be dying. Hiscough was incessant, his eyes sunk and dead, his frame so weak that hecould hardly get into his coach. But never had he shown himself sogreat. His courage rose with every difficulty. His temper, which hadbeen heated by the personal affronts lavished on him through Englishfaction, was hushed by a supreme effort of his will. His large andclear-sighted intellect looked through the temporary embarrassments ofFrench diplomacy and English party strife to the great interests whichhe knew must in the end determine the course of European politics.Abroad and at home all seemed to go against him. For the moment he hadno ally save Holland, for Spain was now united with Lewis, while theattitude of Bavaria divided Germany and held the House of Austria incheck. The Bavarian Elector indeed, who had charge of the SpanishNetherlands and on whom William had counted, openly joined the Frenchside from the first and proclaimed the Duke of Anjou as king inBrussels. In England a new Parliament, which had been called by way oftesting public opinion, was crowded with Tories who were resoluteagainst war. The Tory Ministry pressed him to acknowledge the new kingof Spain; and as even Holland did this, William was forced to submit. Hecould only count on the greed of Lewis to help him, and he did not countin vain. The general approval of the French king's action had sprungfrom a belief that he intended honestly to leave Spain to the Spaniardsunder their new boy-king. Bitter too as the strife of Whig and Torymight be in England, there were two things on which Whig and Tory wereagreed. Neither would suffer France to occupy the Spanish Netherlands.Neither would endure a French attack on the Protestant succession whichthe Revolution of 1688 had established. But the arrogance of Lewisblinded him to the need of moderation in his hour of good-luck. Thewretched defence made by the strong places of the Netherlands in theformer war had brought about an agreement between Spain and Holland atits close, by which seven fortresses, including Luxemburg, Mons, andCharleroi, were garrisoned with Dutch in the place of Spanish troops.The seven were named the Dutch barrier, and the first anxiety both ofHolland and of William was to maintain this arrangement under the newstate of things. William laid down the maintenance of the barrier in hisnegotiations at Madrid as a matter of peace or war. But Lewis was tooeager to wait even for the refusal of William's demand which the prideof the Spanish Court prompted. In February 1701 his troops appeared atthe gates of the seven fortresses; and a secret convention with theElector, who remained in charge of the Netherlands, delivered them intohis hands to hold in trust for his grandson. Other French garrisons tookpossession at the same time of Ostend and the coast towns of Flanders.[Sidenote: The Act of Settlement.]The Parliament of 1701, a Parliament mainly of Tories, and in which theleader of the moderate Tories, Robert Harley, came for the first time tothe front, met amidst the general panic and suspension of trade whichfollowed this seizure of the barrier fortresses. Peace-Parliament as itwas and bitterly as it condemned the Partition Treaties, it at oncesupported William in his demand for a withdrawal of the French troops,and authorized him to conclude a defensive alliance with Holland, whichwould give that State courage to join in the demand. The disclosure of anew Jacobite plot strengthened William's position. The hopes of theJacobites had been raised in the preceding year by the death of theyoung Duke of Gloucester, the only living child of the Princess Anne,and who as William was childless ranked, after his mother, asheir-presumptive of the throne. William was dying, the health of Anneherself was known to be precarious; and to the partisans of James itseemed as if the succession of his son, the boy who was known in laterlife as the Old Pretender, was all but secure. But Tory as theParliament was, it had no mind to undo the work of the Revolution. Whena new Act of Succession was laid before the Houses in 1701 not a voicewas raised for James or his son. By the ordinary rules of heritage thedescendants of the daughter of Charles the First, Henrietta of Orleans,whose only child had married the Duke of Savoy, would come next asclaimants; but the house of Savoy was Catholic and its pretensions werepassed over in the same silence. No other descendants of Charles theFirst remained, and the Parliament fell back on his father's line.Elizabeth, the daughter of James the First, had married the ElectorPalatine; but of her twelve children all had died save one. This wasSophia, the wife of the late and the mother of the present Elector ofHanover. It was in Sophia and the heirs of her body, being Protestants,that the Act of Settlement vested the Crown. But the jealousy of aforeign ruler accompanied this settlement with remarkable provisions.It was enacted that every English sovereign must be in communion withthe Church of England as by law established. All future kings wereforbidden to leave England without consent of Parliament, and foreignerswere excluded from all public posts, military or civil. The independenceof justice, which had been inadequately secured by the Bill of Rights,was now established by a clause which provided that no judge should beremoved from office save on an address from Parliament to the Crown. Thetwo principles that the king acts only through his ministers and thatthese ministers are responsible to Parliament were asserted by arequirement that all public business should be formally done in thePrivy Council and all its decisions signed by its members. These twolast provisions went far to complete the parliamentary Constitutionwhich had been drawn by the Bill of Rights.[Sidenote: The Country and the War.]But, firm as it was in its loyalty to the Revolution, and in its resolveto maintain the independence of the Netherlands, the Parliament hadstill no purpose of war. It assented indeed to the alliance with Hollandin the belief that the pressure of the two powers would bring Lewis to apeaceful settlement of the question. Its aim was still to avoid astanding army and to reduce taxation; and its bitterness against thePartition Treaties sprang from a belief that William had entailed onEngland by their means a contest which must bring back again the armyand the debt. The king was bitterly blamed, while the late ministers,Somers, Russell, and Montague (now become peers), were impeached fortheir share in the treaties; and the Commons prayed the king to excludethe three from his counsels for ever. But a counter-prayer from theLords gave the first sign of a reaction of opinion. Outside the House ofCommons indeed the tide of national feeling rose as the designs of Lewisgrew clearer. He refused to allow the Dutch barrier to bere-established; and a great French fleet gathered in the Channel tosupport, it was believed, a fresh Jacobite descent which was proposed bythe ministers of James in a letter intercepted and laid beforeParliament. Even the House of Commons took fire at this, and the fleetwas raised to thirty thousand men, the army to ten thousand. But thecountry moved faster than the Parliament. Kent sent up a remonstranceagainst the factious measures by which the Tories still struggledagainst the king's policy, with a prayer "that addresses might be turnedinto Bills of Supply"; and William was encouraged by these signs of achange of temper to despatch an English force to Holland, and toconclude a secret treaty with the United Provinces for the recovery ofthe Netherlands from Lewis and for their transfer with the Milanese tothe house of Austria as a means of counterbalancing the new power addedto France.[Sidenote: The Grand Alliance.]England however still clung desperately to a hope of peace; and even inthe Treaty with the Emperor, which followed on the French refusal tonegotiate on a basis of compensation, William was far from disputing theright of Philip of Anjou to the Spanish throne. Hostilities had indeedalready broken out in Italy between the French and Austrian armies; butthe king had not abandoned the dream of a peaceful settlement whenFrance by a sudden act forced him into war. Lewis had acknowledgedWilliam as king in the Peace of Ryswick and pledged himself to opposeall attacks on his throne; but in September 1701 he entered thebedchamber at St. Germain where James the Second was breathing his last,and promised to acknowledge his son at his death as king of England,Scotland, and Ireland. The promise which was thus made was in fact adeclaration of war, and in a moment all England was at one in acceptingthe challenge. The issue Lewis had raised was no longer a matter ofEuropean politics, but a question whether the work of the Revolutionshould be undone, and whether Catholicism and despotism should bereplaced on the throne of England by the arms of France. On such aquestion as this there was no difference between Tory and Whig. EveryEnglishman backed William in his open resentment of the insult and inthe recall of his ambassador. The national union showed itself in thewarm welcome given to the king on his return from the Hague, where theconclusion of a new Grand Alliance in September between the Empire,Holland, and the United Provinces had rewarded William's patience andskill. The Alliance was soon joined by Denmark, Sweden, the Palatinate,and the bulk of the German States. William seized the moment ofenthusiasm to dissolve the Houses whose action had hitherto embarrassedhim; and though the new Parliament which met in 1702 was still Tory inthe main, its Tory members were now as much for war as the Whigs, andthe House of Commons replied to the king's stirring appeal by votingforty thousand soldiers and as many sailors for the coming struggle. Asa telling reply to the recognition of the young James by Lewis, a Billof Attainder was passed against the new Pretender, and correspondencewith him or maintenance of his title was made treason. At the same timeall members of either House and all public officials were sworn touphold the succession of the House of Hanover as established by law.[Sidenote: Marlborough.]The king's weakness was already too great to allow of his taking thefield; and he was forced to entrust the war in the Netherlands to theone Englishman who had shown himself capable of a great command. JohnChurchill, Earl of Marlborough, was born in 1650, the son of aDevonshire Cavalier, whose daughter became at the Restoration mistressof the Duke of York. The shame of Arabella did more perhaps than herfather's loyalty to win for her brother a commission in the royalGuards; and after five years' service abroad under Turenne the youngcaptain became colonel of an English regiment which was retained in theservice of France. He had already shown some of the qualities of a greatsoldier, an unruffled courage, a temper naturally bold and venturesomebut held in check by a cool and serene judgement, a vigilance andcapacity for enduring fatigue which never forsook him. In later years hewas known to spend a whole day in reconnoitring, and at Blenheim heremained on horseback for fifteen hours. But courage and skill in armsdid less for Churchill on his return to the English court than hispersonal beauty. In the French camp he had been known as "the handsomeEnglishman"; and his manners were as winning as his person. Even in agehis address was almost irresistible; "he engrossed the graces," saysChesterfield; and his air never lost the careless sweetness which wonthe favour of Lady Castlemaine. A present of L5000 from the king'smistress laid the foundation of a fortune which grew rapidly togreatness, as the prudent forethought of the handsome young soldierhardened into the avarice of age.[Sidenote: Churchill and James.]But it was to the Duke of York that Churchill looked mainly foradvancement, and he earned it by the fidelity with which as a member ofhis household he clung to the Duke's fortunes during the dark days ofthe Popish Plot. He followed James to Edinburgh and the Hague, and onhis master's return he was rewarded with a peerage and the colonelcy ofthe Life Guards. The service he rendered James after his accession bysaving the royal army from a surprise at Sedgemoor would have been yetmore splendidly acknowledged but for the king's bigotry. In spite of hismaster's personal solicitations Churchill remained true toProtestantism. But he knew James too well to count on further favourafter a formal refusal to abandon his faith. Luckily for him he had nowfound a new groundwork for his fortunes in the growing influence of hiswife over the king's second daughter, Anne; and at the crisis of theRevolution the adhesion of Anne to the cause of Protestantism was of thehighest value. No sentiment of gratitude to his older patron hinderedChurchill from corresponding with the Prince of Orange, from promisingAnne's sympathy to William's effort, or from deserting the ranks of theking's army when it faced William in the field. His desertion provedfatal to the royal cause; but great as this service was it was eclipsedby a second. It was by his wife's persuasion that Anne was induced toforsake her father and take refuge in Danby's camp. Unscrupulous as hisconduct had been, the services which Churchill thus rendered to Williamwere too great to miss their reward. On the new king's accession hebecame Earl of Marlborough; he was put at the head of a force during theIrish war where his rapid successes at once won William's regard; and hewas given high command in the army of Flanders.[Sidenote: Churchill and William.]But the sense of his power over Anne soon turned Marlborough fromplotting treason against James to plot treason against William. Great aswas his greed of gold, he had married Sarah Jennings, a penniless beautyof Charles's court, in whom a violent and malignant temper was strangelycombined with a power of winning and retaining love. Churchill'saffection for her ran like a thread of gold through the dark web of hiscareer. In the midst of his marches and from the very battle-field hewrites to his wife with the same passionate tenderness. The composurewhich no danger or hatred could ruffle broke down into almost womanishdepression at the thought of her coldness or at any burst of her violenthumour. To the last he never left her without a pang. "I did for a greatwhile with a perspective glass look upon the cliffs," he once wrote toher after setting out on a campaign, "in hopes that I might have had onesight of you." It was no wonder that the woman who inspired Marlboroughwith a love like this bound to her the weak and feeble nature of thePrincess Anne. The two friends threw off the restraints of state, andaddressed each other as "Mrs. Freeman" and "Mrs. Morley." It was on hiswife's influence over her friend that the Earl's ambition counted in itsdesigns against William. His subtle policy aimed at availing itself bothof William's unpopularity and of the dread of a Jacobite restoration.His plan was to drive the king from the throne by backing the Tories intheir opposition to the war, as well as by stirring to frenzy theEnglish hatred of foreigners, and then to use the Whig dread of James'sreturn to seat Anne in William's place. The discovery of these designsroused the king to a burst of unusual resentment. "Were I and my LordMarlborough private persons," William exclaimed, "the sword would haveto settle between us." As it was, he could only strip the Earl of hisoffices and command and drive his wife from St. James's. Anne followedher favourite, and the court of the Princess became the centre of theTory opposition: while Marlborough opened a correspondence with James.So notorious was his treason that on the eve of the French invasionwhich was foiled by the victory of La Hogue the Earl was one of thefirst among the suspected persons who were sent to the Tower.[Sidenote: Death of William.]The death of Mary however forced William to recall the Princess, whobecame by this event his successor; and with Anne the Marlboroughsreturned to court. Now indeed that Anne's succession was brought near bythe rapid decay of William's health their loyalty to the throne mightbe counted on; and though William could not bend himself to trust theEarl again, he saw in him as death drew near the one man whose splendidtalents fitted him in spite of the perfidy and treason of his life torule England and direct the Grand Alliance in his stead. He employedMarlborough therefore to negotiate the treaty of alliance with theEmperor, and put him at the head of the army in Flanders. But the Earlhad only just taken the command when a fall from his horse on thetwenty-first of February 1702 proved fatal to the broken frame ofWilliam of Orange. "There was a time when I should have been glad tohave been delivered out of my troubles," the dying man whispered toPortland, "but I own I see another scene, and could wish to live alittle longer." He knew however that the wish was vain; and he died onthe morning of the 8th of March, commending Marlborough to Anne as thefittest person to lead her armies and guide her counsels. Anne's zeal inher friend's cause needed no quickening. Three days after her accessionthe Earl was named Captain-General of the English forces at home andabroad, and entrusted with the entire direction of the war. Hissupremacy over home affairs was secured by the expulsion of the fewremaining Whigs among the ministers, and the construction of a purelyTory administration with Lord Godolphin, a close friend ofMarlborough's, as Lord Treasurer at its head. The Queen's affection forhis wife ensured him the support of the Crown at a moment when Anne'spersonal popularity gave the Crown a new weight with the nation. InEngland indeed party feeling for the moment died away. The Parliamentcalled on the new accession was strongly Tory; but all save the extremeTories were won over to the war now that it was waged on behalf of aTory queen by a Tory general, while the most extreme of the Whigs wereready to back even a Tory general in waging a Whig war.[Sidenote: Marlborough and the Allies.]Abroad however William's death shook the Alliance to its base; and evenHolland wavered in dread of being deserted by England in the comingstruggle. But the decision of Marlborough soon did away with thisdistrust. Anne was made to declare from the throne her resolve to pursuewith energy the policy of her predecessor. The Parliament was brought tosanction vigorous measures for the prosecution of the war. The newgeneral hastened to the Hague, received the command of the Dutch as wellas of the English forces, and drew the German powers into theConfederacy with a skill and adroitness which even William might haveenvied. Never indeed was greatness more quickly recognised than in thecase of Marlborough. In a few months he was regarded by all as theguiding spirit of the Alliance, and princes whose jealousy had worn outthe patience of the king yielded without a struggle to the counsels ofhis successor. His temper fitted him in an especial way to be the headof a great confederacy. Like William, he owed little of his power to anyearly training. The trace of his neglected education was seen to thelast in his reluctance to write. "Of all things," he said to his wife,"I do not love writing." To pen a despatch indeed was a far greatertrouble to Marlborough than to plan a campaign. But nature had given himqualities which in other men spring specially from culture. His capacityfor business was immense. During the next ten years he assumed thegeneral direction of the war in Flanders and in Spain. He managed everynegotiation with the courts of the allies. He watched over the shiftingphases of English politics. He crossed the Channel to win over Anne to achange in the cabinet, or hurried to Berlin to secure the due contingentof Electoral troops from Brandenburg. At one and the same moment men sawhim reconciling the Emperor with the Protestants of Hungary, stirringthe Calvinists of the Cevennes into revolt, arranging the affairs ofPortugal, and providing for the protection of the Duke of Savoy.[Sidenote: His temper.]But his air showed no trace of fatigue or haste or vexation. He retainedto the last the indolent grace of his youth. His natural dignity wasnever ruffled by an outbreak of temper. Amidst the storm of battle hissoldiers saw their leader "without fear of danger or in the least hurrygiving his orders with all the calmness imaginable." In the cabinet hewas as cool as on the battle-field. He met with the same equableserenity the pettiness of the German princes, the phlegm of the Dutch,the ignorant opposition of his officers, the libels of his politicalopponents. There was a touch of irony in the simple expedients by whichhe sometimes solved problems which had baffled cabinets. The touchypride of the king of Prussia in his new royal dignity, when he rose frombeing a simple Elector of Brandenburg to a throne, made him one of themost vexatious among the allies; but all difficulty with him ceased whenMarlborough rose at a state banquet and glutted his vanity by handinghim a napkin. Churchill's composure rested partly on a pride which couldnot stoop to bare the real self within to the eyes of meaner men. In thebitter moments before his fall he bade Godolphin burn some querulousletters which the persecution of his opponents had wrung from him; "Mydesire," he wrote, "is that the world may continue in their error ofthinking me a happy man, for I think it better to be envied thanpitied." But in great measure it sprang from the purely intellectualtemper of his mind. His passion for his wife was the one sentiment whichtinged the colourless light in which his understanding moved. In allelse he was without affection or resentment, he knew neither doubt norregret. In private life he was a humane and compassionate man; but ifhis position required it he could betray Englishmen to death or lead hisarmy to a butchery such as that of Malplaquet. Of honour or the finersentiments of mankind he knew nothing; and he turned without a shockfrom guiding Europe and winning great victories to heap up a matchlessfortune by peculation and greed. He is perhaps the only instance of aman of real greatness who loved money for money's sake. No life indeed,no temper ever stood more aloof from the common life and temper ofmankind. The passions which stirred the men around him, whether noble orignoble, were to Marlborough simply elements in an intellectual problemwhich had to be solved by patience. "Patience will overcome all things,"he writes again and again. "As I think most things are governed bydestiny, having done all things we should submit with patience."[Sidenote: Opening of the War.]As a statesman the high qualities of Marlborough were owned by hisbitterest foes. "Over the Confederacy," says Lord Bolingbroke, "he, anew, a private man, acquired by merit and management a more decidedinfluence than high birth, confirmed authority, and even the crown ofGreat Britain had given to King William." But great as he was in thecouncil, he was even greater in the field. He stands alone amongst themasters of the art of war as a captain whose victories began at an agewhen the work of most men is done. Though he served as a young officerunder Turenne, and for a few months in Ireland and the Netherlands,Marlborough had held no great command till he took the field in Flandersat the age of fifty-two. He stands alone too in his unbroken goodfortune. Voltaire notes that he never besieged a fortress which he didnot take, or fought a battle which he did not win. His difficultiesindeed came not so much from the enemy as from the ignorance andtimidity of his own allies. He was never defeated in the field, butvictory after victory was snatched from him by the incapacity of hisofficers or the stubbornness of the Dutch. What startled the cautiousstrategists of his day was the vigour and audacity of his plans. Old ashe was, Marlborough's designs had from the first all the dash andboldness of youth. On taking the field in 1702 he at once resolved toforce a battle in the heart of Brabant. The plan was foiled by thetimidity and resistance of the Dutch deputies. But his resolute advanceacross the Meuse drew the French forces from that river and enabled himto reduce fortress after fortress in a series of sieges, till thesurrender of Liege closed a campaign which cut off the French from theLower Rhine and freed Holland from all danger of invasion.[Sidenote: The French in Germany.]The successes of Marlborough had been brought into bolder relief by thefortunes of the war in other quarters. Though the Imperialist general,Prince Eugene of Savoy, showed his powers by a surprise of the Frencharmy at Cremona, no real successes had been won in Italy. An Englishdescent on the Spanish coast ended in failure. In Germany, where theBavarians joined the French, their united armies defeated the army ofthe Empire and opened the line of the Danube to a French advance. It wasin this quarter that Lewis resolved to push his fortunes in the comingyear. In the spring of 1703 a French army under Marshal Villars againrelieved the Bavarian Elector from the pressure of the Austrian forces,and only a strife which arose between the two commanders hindered theirjoint armies from marching on Vienna. Meanwhile the timidity of theDutch deputies served Lewis well in the Low Countries. The hopes ofMarlborough, who had been raised to a dukedom for his services in theprevious year, were again foiled by the deputies of the States-General.Serene as his temper was, it broke down before their refusal toco-operate in an attack on Antwerp and French Flanders; and the prayersof Godolphin and of the Pensionary Heinsius alone induced him towithdraw his offer of resignation. In spite of his victories on theDanube, indeed, of the blunders of his adversaries on the Rhine, and thesudden aid of an insurrection against the Court of Vienna which brokeout in Hungary, the difficulties of Lewis were hourly increasing. Theaccession of Savoy to the Grand Alliance threatened his armies in Italywith destruction. That of Portugal gave the allies a base of operationsagainst Spain. The French king's energy however rose with the pressure;and while the Duke of Berwick, a natural son of James the Second, wasdespatched against Portugal, and three small armies closed round Savoy,the flower of the French troops joined the army of Bavaria on theDanube, for the bold plan of Lewis was to decide the fortunes of the warby a victory which would wrest peace from the Empire under the walls ofVienna.[Sidenote: Marlborough in Germany.]The master-stroke of Lewis roused Marlborough at the opening of 1704 toa master-stroke in return; but the secrecy and boldness of the Duke'splans deceived both his enemies and his allies. The French army inFlanders saw in his march from the Netherlands upon Maintz only a designto transfer the war into Elsass. The Dutch on the other hand were luredinto suffering their troops to be drawn as far from Flanders as Coblentzby the Duke's proposals for an imaginary campaign on the Moselle. It wasonly when Marlborough crossed the Neckar and struck through the centreof Germany for the Danube that the true aim of his operations wasrevealed to both. After struggling through the hill country ofWurtemberg he joined the Imperial army under the Prince of Baden,stormed the heights of Donauwerth, crossed the Danube and the Lech, andpenetrated into the heart of Bavaria. The crisis drew two other armieswhich were facing one another on the Upper Rhine to the scene. Thearrival of Marshal Tallard with thirty thousand French troops saved theElector of Bavaria for the moment from the need of submission; but thejunction of his opponent, Prince Eugene, with Marlborough raised thecontending forces again to an equality. After a few marches the armiesmet on the north bank of the Danube near the small town of Hochstaedt andthe village of Blindheim or Blenheim, which have given their names toone of the most memorable battles in the history of the world.[Sidenote: Battle of Blenheim.]In one respect the struggle which followed stands almost unrivalled, forthe whole of the Teutonic race was represented in the strange medley ofEnglishmen, Dutchmen, Hanoverians, Danes, Wurtembergers and Austrianswho followed Marlborough and Eugene. The French and Bavarians, whonumbered like their opponents some fifty thousand men, lay behind alittle stream which ran through swampy ground to the Danube. Theirposition was a strong one, for its front was covered by the swamp, itsright by the Danube, its left by the hill-country in which the streamrose; and Tallard had not only entrenched himself but was far superiorto his rival in artillery. But for once Marlborough's hands were free."I have great reason," he wrote calmly home, "to hope that everythingwill go well, for I have the pleasure to find all the officers willingto obey without knowing any other reason than that it is my desire,which is very different from what it was in Flanders, where I wasobliged to have the consent of a council of war for everything Iundertook." So formidable were the obstacles, however, that though theallies were in motion at sunrise on the 13th of August it was not tillmidday that Eugene, who commanded on the right, succeeded in crossingthe stream. The English foot at once forded it on the left, and attackedthe village of Blindheim in which the bulk of the French infantry wereentrenched; but after a furious struggle the attack was repulsed, whileas gallant a resistance at the other end of the line held Eugene incheck. It was the centre however, where the French believed themselvesto be unassailable, and which this belief had led them to weaken bydrawing troops to their wings, that had been chosen by Marlborough fromthe first for the chief point of attack. By making an artificial roadacross the morass which covered it, he was at last enabled to throw hiseight thousand horsemen on the mass of the French cavalry, whichoccupied this position; and two desperate charges which the Duke headedin person decided the day. The French centre was flung back on theDanube and forced to surrender. Their left fell back in confusion onHochstaedt: while their right, cooped up in Blindheim and cut off fromretreat, became prisoners of war. Of the defeated army only twentythousand men escaped. Twelve thousand were slain, fourteen thousand werecaptured. Vienna was saved, Germany finally freed from the French, andMarlborough, who followed the wreck of the French host in its flight toElsass, soon made himself master of the Lower Moselle.[Sidenote: Occasional conformity.]But the loss of France could not be measured by men or fortresses. Ahundred victories since Rocroi had taught the world to regard the armiesof Lewis as all but invincible, when Blenheim and the surrender of theflower of the French soldiery broke the spell. From that moment theterror of victory passed to the side of the allies, and "Malbrook"became a name of fear to every child in France. In England itself thevictory of Blenheim aided to bring about a great change in the politicalaspect of affairs. The Tories were already pressing hard on the defeatedWhigs. If they were willing to support the war abroad, they wereresolved to use the accession of a Stuart to the throne to secure theirown power at home. They resolved therefore to make a fresh attempt tocreate a permanent Tory majority in the Commons by excludingNonconformists from the municipal corporations, which returned the bulkof the borough members, and whose political tendencies were for themost part Whig. The test of receiving the sacrament according to theritual of the Church of England, effective as it was against Catholics,was useless against Protestant Dissenters. While adhering to theirseparate congregations, in which they were now protected by theToleration Act, they "qualified for office," as it was called, by the"occasional conformity" of receiving the sacrament at church once in theyear. It was against "occasional conformity" that the Tories introduceda test which by excluding the Nonconformists would have given them thecommand of the boroughs; and this test at first received Marlborough'ssupport. But it was rejected by the Lords as often as it was sent up tothem, and it was soon guessed that the resistance of the Lords wassecretly backed by both Marlborough and Godolphin. Tory as he was, infact, Marlborough had no mind for an unchecked Tory rule, or for ameasure which would be fatal to the war by again reviving religiousstrife. But it was in vain that he strove to propitiate his party byinducing the Queen to set aside the tenths and first-fruits hithertopaid by the clergy to the Crown as a fund for the augmentation of smallbenefices, a fund which still bears the name of Queen Anne's Bounty. TheCommons showed their resentment against Marlborough by refusing to add agrant of money to the grant of a dukedom after his first campaign; andthe higher Tories, with Lord Nottingham at their head, began to throwevery obstacle they could in the way of the continuance of the war.[Sidenote: The Coalition Ministry.]Nottingham and his followers at last quitted office in 1704, andMarlborough replaced them by Tories of a more moderate stamp who werestill in favour of the war; by Robert Harley, who became Secretary ofState, and by Henry St. John, a young man of splendid talents, who wasnamed Secretary at War. Small as the change seemed, its significance wasclear to both parties; and the Duke's march into Germany gave hisenemies an opportunity of embittering the political strife. The originalaim of the Tories had been to limit English efforts to what seemedpurely English objects, the defence of the Netherlands and of Englishcommerce; and the bulk of them shrank even now from any furtherentanglement in the struggle. But the Duke's march seemed at once topledge England to a strife in the very heart of the Continent, and aboveall to a strife on behalf of the House of Austria, whose designs uponSpain were regarded with almost as much suspicion as those of Lewis. Itwas an act indeed of even greater political than military daring. TheHigh Tories and Jacobites threatened if Marlborough failed to bring hishead to the block; and only the victory of Blenheim saved him frompolitical ruin. Slowly and against his will the Duke drifted from hisown party to the party which really backed his policy. He availedhimself of the national triumph over Blenheim to dissolve Parliament;and when the election of 1705, as he hoped, returned a majority infavour of the war, his efforts brought about a coalition between themoderate Tories who still clung to him and the Whig Junto, whose supportwas purchased by making a Whig, William Cowper, Lord Keeper, and bysending Lord Sunderland as envoy to Vienna.[Sidenote: Ramillies.]The bitter attacks of the peace party were entirely foiled by thisunion, and Marlborough at last felt secure at home. But he had to beardisappointment abroad. His plan of attack along the line of the Mosellewas defeated by the refusal of the Imperial army to join him. When hetransferred the war again to the Netherlands and entered the Frenchlines across the Dyle, the Dutch generals withdrew their troops; and hisproposal to attack the Duke of Villeroy in the field of Waterloo wasrejected in full council of war by the deputies of the States with criesof "murder" and "massacre." Even Marlborough's composure broke intobitterness at this last blow. "Had I the same power I had last year," hewrote home, "I could have won a greater victory than that of Blenheim."On his complaint indeed the States recalled their commissaries, but theyear was lost; nor had greater results been brought about in Italy or onthe Rhine. The spirits of the allies were only sustained by theromantic exploits of Lord Peterborough in Spain. Profligate,unprincipled, flighty as he was, Peterborough had a genius for war, andhis seizure of Barcelona with a handful of men, a step followed by hisrecognition of the old liberties of Aragon, roused that province tosupport the cause of the second son of the Emperor, who had beenacknowledged as King of Spain by the allies under the title of Charlesthe Third. Catalonia and Valencia soon joined Aragon in declaring forCharles: while Marlborough spent the winter of 1705 in negotiations atVienna, Berlin, Hanover, and the Hague, and in preparations for thecoming campaign. Eager for freedom of action and sick of the Imperialgenerals as of the Dutch, he planned a march over the Alps and acampaign in Italy; and though these designs were defeated by theopposition of the allies, he found himself unfettered when he againappeared in Flanders in 1706. Marshal Villeroy, the new French general,was as eager as Marlborough for an engagement; and the two armies met onthe 23rd of May at the village of Ramillies on an undulating plain whichforms the highest ground in Brabant. The French were drawn up in a widecurve with morasses covering their front. After a feint on their left,Marlborough flung himself on their right wing at Ramillies, crushed itin a brilliant charge that he led in person, and swept along their wholeline till it broke in a rout which only ended beneath the walls ofLouvain. In an hour and a half the French had lost fifteen thousand men,their baggage, and their guns; and the line of the Scheldt, Brussels,Antwerp and Bruges became the prize of the victors. It only needed foursuccessful sieges which followed the battle of Ramillies to complete thedeliverance of Flanders.[Sidenote: The Union with Scotland.]The year which witnessed the victory of Ramillies remains yet morememorable as the year which witnessed the final Union of England withScotland. As the undoing of the earlier union had been the first work ofthe Government of the Restoration, its revival was one of the first aimsof the Government which followed the Revolution. But the project waslong held in check by religious and commercial jealousies. Scotlandrefused to bear any part of the English debt. England would not yieldany share in her monopoly of trade with the colonies. The EnglishChurchmen longed for a restoration of Episcopacy north of the Border,while the Scotch Presbyterians would not hear even of the legaltoleration of Episcopalians. In 1703 however an Act of Settlement whichpassed through the Scotch Parliament at last brought home to Englishstatesmen the dangers of further delay. In dealing with this measure theScotch Whigs, who cared only for the independence of their country,joined hand in hand with the Scotch Jacobites, who looked only to theinterests of the Pretender. The Jacobites excluded from the Act thename of the Princess Sophia; the Whigs introduced a provision that nosovereign of England should be recognized as sovereign of Scotland saveupon security given to the religion, freedom, and trade of the Scottishpeople. The danger arising from such a measure was undoubtedly great,for it pointed to a recognition of the Pretender in Scotland on theQueen's death, and such a recognition meant war between Scotland andEngland. The need of a union became at once apparent to every statesman,but it was only after three years' delay that the wisdom and resolutionof Lord Somers brought the question to an issue. The Scotch proposals ofa federative rather than a legislative union were set aside by hisfirmness; the commercial jealousies of the English traders were put by;and the Act of Union as it was completed in 1706, though not finallypassed till the following year, provided that the two kingdoms should beunited into one under the name of Great Britain, and that the successionto the crown of this United Kingdom should be ruled by the provisions ofthe English Act of Settlement. The Scotch Church and the Scotch law wereleft untouched: but all rights of trade were thrown open to bothnations, a common system of taxation was established, and a uniformsystem of coinage adopted. A single Parliament was henceforth torepresent the United Kingdom; and for this purpose forty-five Scotchmembers, a number taken to represent the proportion of Scotch propertyand population relatively to England, were added to the five hundred andthirteen English members of the House of Commons, and sixteenrepresentative peers to the one hundred and eight who formed the EnglishHouse of Lords.[Sidenote: Its results.]In Scotland the opposition to this measure was bitter and almostuniversal. The terror of the Presbyterians indeed was met by an Act ofSecurity which became part of the Treaty of Union, and which required anoath to support the Presbyterian Church from every sovereign on hisaccession. But no securities could satisfy the enthusiastic patriots orthe fanatical Cameronians. The Jacobites sought troops from France andplotted a Stuart restoration. The nationalists talked of seceding fromthe Houses which voted for the Union and of establishing a rivalParliament. In the end however good sense and the loyalty of the tradingclasses to the cause of the Protestant succession won their way. Themeasure was adopted by the Scotch Parliament, and the Treaty of Unionbecame a legislative Act to which Anne in 1707 gave her assent in noblewords. "I desire," said the Queen, "and expect from my subjects of bothnations that from henceforth they act with all possible respect andkindness to one another, that so it may appear to all the world theyhave hearts disposed to become one people." Time has more than answeredthese hopes. The two nations whom the Union brought together have eversince remained one. England gained in the removal of a constant dangerof treason and war. To Scotland the Union opened up new avenues ofwealth which the energy of its people turned to wonderful account. Thefarms of Lothian have become models of agricultural skill. A fishingtown on the Clyde has grown into the rich and populous Glasgow. Peaceand culture have changed the wild clansmen of the Highlands intoherdsmen and farmers. Nor was the change followed by any loss ofnational spirit. The world has hardly seen a mightier and more rapiddevelopement of national energy than that of Scotland after the Union.All that passed away was the jealousy which had parted since the days ofEdward the First two peoples whom a common blood and common speechproclaimed to be one. The Union between Scotland and England has beenreal and stable simply because it was the legislative acknowledgementand enforcement of a national fact.[Sidenote: Marlborough's difficulties.]With the defeat of Ramillies and the conclusion of the Union thegreatness of Marlborough reached its height. In five years he hadrescued Holland, saved Germany, and thrown France back on a purelydefensive position. He exercised an undisputed supremacy over analliance which embraced the greatest European powers. At home he waspractically first minister, commander-in-chief, and absolute masterthrough his wife of the Queen herself. He was looked upon as the mostpowerful as he was the wealthiest subject in the world. And whileMarlborough's fortunes mounted to their height those of France sank totheir lowest ebb. Eugene in his greatest victory broke the siege ofTurin, and Lewis saw the loss of Flanders followed by the loss of Italy.Not only did Peterborough hold his ground in Spain, but Charles theThird, with an army of English and Portuguese, entered Madrid. But itwas in fact only these triumphs abroad that enabled Marlborough to facethe difficulties which were opening on him at home. His command of theParliament rested now on a coalition of the Whigs with the moderateTories who still adhered to him after his break with the more violentmembers of his old party. Ramillies gave him strength enough to forceAnne in spite of her hatred of the Whigs to fulfil the compact with themfrom which this coalition had sprung, by admitting Lord Sunderland, thebitterest leader of their party, to office as Secretary of State at theclose of 1706. But with the entry of Sunderland into office the systemof political balance which the Duke had maintained till now began atonce to break down. Constitutionally, Marlborough's was the last attemptto govern England on other terms than those of party government, and theunion of parties to which he had clung ever since his severance fromthe extreme Tories became every day more impossible as the growingopposition of the Tories to the war threw the Duke more and more on thesupport of the Whigs.[Sidenote: Triumph of the Whigs.]The Whigs sold their support dearly. Sunderland's violent and imperioustemper differed widely from the supple and unscrupulous nature which hadcarried his father, the Lord Sunderland of the Restoration, unhurtthrough the violent changes of his day. But he had inherited hisfather's conceptions of party government. He was resolved to restore astrict party administration on a purely Whig basis, and to drive themoderate Tories from office in spite of Marlborough's desire to retainthem. The Duke wrote hotly home at the news of the pressure which theWhigs were putting on him. "England," he said, "will not be ruinedbecause a few men are not pleased." Nor was Marlborough alone in hisresentment. Harley foresaw the danger of his expulsion from office, andeven as early as 1706 began to intrigue at court, through Mrs. Masham, abedchamber woman of the Queen, who was supplanting the Duchess in Anne'sfavour, against the Whigs and against Marlborough, whom he looked uponas in the hands of the Whigs. St. John, though bound by ties ofgratitude to the Duke, to whose favour he owed his early promotion tooffice, was driven by the same fear to share Harley's schemes.Marlborough strove to win both of them back, but the growing oppositionof the Tories to the war left him helpless in the hands of the onlyparty that steadily supported it. A factious union of the Whigs withtheir opponents, though it roused the Duke to a burst of unusual passionin Parliament, effected its end by convincing him of the impossibilityof further resistance. The resistance of the Queen indeed was stubbornand bitter. Anne was at heart a Tory, and her old trust in Marlboroughdied with his submission to the Whig demands. It was only by the threatof resignation that he had forced her to admit Sunderland to office; andthe violent outbreak of temper with which the Duchess enforced herhusband's will changed the Queen's friendship for her into a bitterresentment. Marlborough was forced to increase this resentment by freshcompliances with the conditions which the Whigs imposed on him, byremoving Peterborough from his command as a Tory general, and bywresting from Anne her consent in 1708 to the dismissal from office ofHarley and St. John with the whole of the moderate Tories whom theyheaded. Their removal was followed by the complete triumph of the Whigsin the admission of Lords Somers and Wharton into the ministry. Somersbecame President of the Council, Wharton Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,while lower posts were occupied by younger men of the same party, whowere destined to play a great part in our later history, such as theyoung Duke of Newcastle and Robert Walpole.[Sidenote: Oudenarde.]Meanwhile, the great struggle abroad went steadily against France,though its progress was varied with striking alternations of success.France rose indeed with singular rapidity from the crushing blow ofRamillies. Spain was recovered for Philip in 1707 by a victory ofMarshal Berwick at Almanza. Marshal Villars won fresh triumphs on theRhine; while Eugene, who had penetrated into Provence, was driven backinto Italy. In Flanders Marlborough's designs for taking advantage ofhis great victory were foiled by the strategy of the Duke of Vendome andby the reluctance of the Dutch, who were now wavering towards peace. Inthe campaign of 1708 however Vendome, in spite of his superiority inforce, was attacked and defeated at Oudenarde; and though Marlboroughwas hindered from striking at the heart of France by the timidity of theEnglish and Dutch statesmen, he reduced Lille, the strongest of itsfrontier fortresses, in the face of an army of relief which numbered ahundred thousand men. The blow proved an effective one. The pride ofLewis was at last broken by defeat and by the terrible sufferings ofFrance. He offered terms of peace which yielded all that the allies hadfought for. He consented to withdraw his aid from Philip of Spain, togive up ten Flemish fortresses as a barrier for the Dutch, and tosurrender to the Empire all that France had gained since the Treaty ofWestphalia. He offered to acknowledge Anne, to banish the Pretender fromhis dominions, and to demolish the fortifications of Dunkirk, a porthateful to England as the home of the French privateers.[Sidenote: Peace rejected.]To Marlborough these terms seemed sufficient, and for the moment heregarded peace as secure. Peace was indeed now the general wish of thenation, and the longing for it was nowhere stronger than with the Queen.Dull and sluggish as was Anne's temper, she had the pride andstubbornness of her race, and both revolted against the submission towhich she was forced. If she bowed to the spirit of the Revolution byyielding implicitly to the decision of her Parliament, she held firmlyto the ceremonial traditions of the monarchy of her ancestors. She dinedin royal state, she touched for the evil in her progresses, she presidedat every meeting of council or cabinet, she insisted on every measureproposed by her ministers being previously laid before her. She shrankfrom party government as an enslavement of the Crown; and claimed theright to call on men from either side to aid in the administration ofthe State. But if England was to be governed by a party, she wasresolved that it should be her own party. She had been bred a Tory. Heryouth had fallen among the storms of the Exclusion Bill, and she lookedon Whigs as disguised republicans. Above all her pride was outraged bythe concessions which were forced from her. She had prayed Godolphin tohelp her in excluding Sunderland as a thing on which the peace of herlife depended. She trembled every day before the violent temper of theDuchess of Marlborough, and before the threat of resignation by whichthe Duke himself crushed her first faint efforts at revolt. She longedfor a peace which would free her from both Marlborough and the Whigs, asthe Whigs on the other hand were resolute for a war which kept them inpower. It was on this ground that they set aside the Duke's counsels andanswered the French proposals of peace by terms which made peaceimpossible. They insisted on the transfer of the whole Spanish monarchyto the Austrian prince. When even this seemed likely to be conceded theydemanded that Lewis should with his own troops compel his grandson togive up the crown of Spain.[Sidenote: Sacheverell.]"If I must wage war," replied the French king, "I had rather wage itwith my enemies than with my children." In a bitter despair he appealedto France; and, exhausted as the country was by the struggle, thecampaign of 1709 proved how nobly France answered his appeal. Theterrible slaughter which bears the name of the battle of Malplaquetshowed a new temper in the French soldiers. Starving as they were, theyflung away their rations in their eagerness for the fight, and fellback at its close in serried masses that no efforts of Marlborough couldbreak. They had lost twelve thousand men, but the forcing their lines ofentrenchment had cost the allies a loss of double that number. Horror atsuch a "deluge of blood" increased the general distaste for the war; andthe rejection of fresh French offers in 1710, a rejection unjustlyattributed to Marlborough's desire for the lengthening out of a contestwhich brought him profit and power, fired at last the smoulderingdiscontent into flame. A storm of popular passion burst suddenly on theWhigs. Its occasion was a dull and silly sermon in which a High Churchdivine, Dr. Sacheverell, maintained the doctrine of non-resistance atSt. Paul's. His boldness challenged prosecution; but in spite of thewarning of Marlborough and of Somers the Whig Ministers resolved on hisimpeachment before the Lords, and the trial at once widened into a greatparty struggle. An outburst of popular enthusiasm in Sacheverell'sfavour showed what a storm of hatred had gathered against the Whigs andthe war. The most eminent of the Tory Churchmen stood by his side at thebar, crowds escorted him to the court and back again, while the streetsrang with cries of "The Church and Dr. Sacheverell." A small majority ofthe peers found the preacher guilty, but the light sentence theyinflicted was in effect an acquittal, and bonfires and illuminationsover the whole country welcomed it as a Tory triumph.[Sidenote: Dismissal of the Whigs.]The turn of popular feeling at once roused to new life the party whomthe Whigs had striven to crush. The expulsion of Harley and St. Johnfrom the Ministry had given the Tories leaders of a more subtle andvigorous stamp than the High Churchmen who had quitted office in thefirst years of the war; and St. John brought into play a new engine ofpolitical attack whose powers soon made themselves felt. In the_Examiner_, and in a crowd of pamphlets and periodicals which followedin its train, the humour of the poet Prior, the bitter irony of Swift,an Irish writer who was now forcing his way into fame, as well as St.John's own brilliant sophistry, spent themselves on the abuse of the warand of its general. "Six millions of supplies and almost fifty millionsof debt!" Swift wrote bitterly; "the High Allies have been the ruin ofus!" Marlborough was ridiculed and reviled, even his courage was calledin question; he was charged with insolence, with cruelty and ambition,with corruption and greed. The virulence of the abuse would havedefeated its aim had not the general sense of the people condemned themaintenance of the war, and encouraged Anne to free herself from theyoke beneath which she had bent so long. At the close of Sacheverell'strial she broke with the Duchess. Marlborough looked for support to theWhigs; but the subtle intrigue of Harley was as busy in undermining theMinistry as St. John was in openly attacking it. The Whigs, who knewthat the Duke's league with them had simply been forced on him by thewar, and who had already foiled an attempt he had made to secure himselfby the demand of a grant for life of his office of Commander-in-Chief,were easily persuaded that the Queen's sole object was his personalhumiliation. They looked coolly therefore on at the dismissal ofSunderland, who had now become his son-in-law, and of Godolphin, who washis closest friend. The same means were adopted to bring about the ruinof the Whigs themselves: and Marlborough, lured easily by hopes ofreconciliation with his old party, looked on as coolly while Annedismissed her Whig counsellors and named a Tory Ministry, with Harleyand St. John at its head, in their place.[Sidenote: Fall of Marlborough.]The time was now come for a final and decisive blow; but how great adread Marlborough still inspired in his enemies was shown by theshameful treachery with which they still thought it needful to bringabout his fall. The intrigues of Harley paled before the subtler treasonof Henry St. John. Young as he was, for he had hardly reached histhirty-second year, St. John had already shown his ability as Secretaryof War under Marlborough himself, his brilliant rhetoric gave him a holdover the House of Commons which even the sense of his restlessness andrecklessness failed to shake, while the vigour and eloquence of hiswritings infused a new colour and force into political literature. Hewas resolute for peace; but he pressed on the work of peace with anutter indifference to all but party ends. As Marlborough was his greatobstacle, his aim was to drive him from his command; and earnestly as headmired the Duke's greatness, he hounded on a tribe of libellers whoassailed even his personal courage. Meanwhile St. John was feedingMarlborough's hopes of reconciliation with the Tories, till he led himto acquiesce in his wife's dismissal, and to pledge himself to aco-operation with the Tory policy. It was the Duke's belief that areconciliation with the Tories was effected that led him to sanction thedespatch of troops which should have strengthened his army in Flanderson a fruitless expedition against Canada, though this left him too weakto carry out a masterly plan which he had formed for a march into theheart of France in the opening of 1711. He was unable even to risk abattle or to do more than to pick up a few seaboard towns, and St. Johnat once turned the small results of the campaign into an argument forthe conclusion of peace. Peace was indeed all but concluded. In defianceof an article of the Grand Alliance which pledged its members not tocarry on separate negotiations with France, St. John, who now becameLord Bolingbroke, pushed forward through the summer of 1711 a secretaccommodation between England and France. It was for this negotiationthat he had crippled Marlborough's campaign; and it was the discovery ofhis perfidy which revealed to the Duke how utterly he had been betrayed,and forced him at last to break with the Tory Minister.[Sidenote: Treaty of Utrecht.]He returned to England; and his efforts induced the House of Lords todenounce the contemplated peace; but the support of the Commons and theQueen, and the general hatred of the war among the people, enabledHarley to ride down all resistance. At the opening of 1712 the Whigmajority in the House of Lords was swamped by the creation of twelveTory peers. Marlborough was dismissed from his command, charged withpeculation, and condemned as guilty by a vote of the House of Commons.The Duke at once withdrew from England, and with his withdrawal allopposition to the peace was at an end. His flight was in fact followedby the conclusion of a Treaty at Utrecht between France, England, andthe Dutch; and the desertion of his allies forced even the Emperor atlast to make peace at Rastadt. By these treaties the original aim of thewar, that of preventing the possession of France and Spain at once bythe House of Bourbon, was silently abandoned. No precaution was in facttaken against the dangers it involved to the balance of power, save by aprovision that the two crowns should never be united on a single head,and by Philip's renunciation of all right of succession to the throneof France. The principle on which the Treaties were based was in factthat of the earlier Treaties of Partition. Spain was stripped of evenmore than William had proposed to take from her. Philip retained Spainand the Indies: but he ceded his possessions in Italy and theNetherlands with the island of Sardinia to Charles of Austria, who hadnow become Emperor, in satisfaction of his claims; while he handed overSicily to the Duke of Savoy. To England he gave up not only Minorca butGibraltar, two positions which secured her the command of theMediterranean. France purchased peace by less costly concessions. Shehad to consent to the re-establishment of the Dutch barrier on a greaterscale than before; to pacify the English resentment against the Frenchprivateers by the dismantling of Dunkirk; and not only to recognize theright of Anne to the crown, and the Protestant succession in the Houseof Hanover, but to consent to the expulsion of the Pretender from hersoil.[Sidenote: Harley and Bolingbroke.]The failure of the Queen's health made the succession the real questionof the day, and it was a question which turned all politics into factionand intrigue. The Whigs, who were still formidable in the Commons, andwho showed the strength of their party in the Lords by defeating aTreaty of Commerce in which Bolingbroke anticipated the greatestfinancial triumph of William Pitt and secured freedom of trade betweenEngland and France, were zealous for the succession of the House ofHanover in the well-founded belief that the Elector George hated theTories; nor did the Tories, though the Jacobite sympathies of a portionof their party forced both Harley and Bolingbroke to keep up a delusivecorrespondence with the Pretender, who had withdrawn to Lorraine, reallycontemplate any other succession than that of the Elector. But on themeans of providing for his succession Harley and Bolingbroke differedwidely. Harley, still influenced by the Presbyterian leanings of hisearly life, and more jealous of Lord Rochester and the high Tories heheaded than of the Whigs themselves, inclined to an alliance between themoderate Tories and their opponents, as in the earlier days ofMarlborough's power. The policy of Bolingbroke on the other hand was soto strengthen the Tories by the utter overthrow of their opponents thatwhatever might be the Elector's sympathies they could force their policyon him as king; and in the advances which Harley made to the Whigs hesaw the means of ruining his rival in the confidence of his party, andof taking his place at their head. It was with this purpose that heintroduced a Schism Bill, which would have hindered any Nonconformistfrom acting as a schoolmaster or a tutor. The success of this measurebroke Harley's plans by creating a bitterer division between Tory andWhig than ever, while it humiliated him by the failure of his oppositionto it. But its effects went far beyond Bolingbroke's intentions. TheWhigs regarded the Bill as the first step in a Jacobite restoration, andwarned the Electress Sophia that she must look for a struggle againsther accession to the throne. Sophia was herself alarmed, and the more sothat Anne's health was visibly breaking. In April 1714 therefore theHanoverian ambassador demanded for the son of the Elector, the futureGeorge the Second, who had been created Duke of Cambridge, a writ ofsummons as peer to the coming Parliament. The aim of the demand wassimply that a Hanoverian prince might be present on the spot to maintainthe right of his House in case of the Queen's death. But to Anne itseemed to furnish at once a head to the Whig opposition which wouldrender a Tory government impossible; and her anger, fanned byBolingbroke, broke out in a letter to the aged Electress which warnedher that "such conduct may imperil the succession itself."[Sidenote: Death of Anne.]To Sophia the letter was a sentence of death; two days after she readit, as she was walking in the garden at Herrenhausen, she fell in adying swoon to the ground. The correspondence was at once published, andnecessarily quickened the alarm not only of the Whigs, but of the moremoderate section of the Tories themselves. But Bolingbroke used thebreach which now declared itself between himself and his rival withunscrupulous skill. Though Anne had shown her confidence in Harley byconferring on him the earldom of Oxford, her resentment at the conductof the Hanoverian Court was so skilfully played upon that she wasbrought in July to dismiss the Earl, as a partisan of the House ofHanover, and to construct a strong and united Tory Ministry which wouldback the Queen in her resistance to the Elector's demand. As the crisisgrew nearer, both parties prepared for civil war. In the beginning of1714 the Whigs had made ready for a rising on the Queen's death; andinvited Marlborough from Flanders to head them, in the hope that hisname would rally the army to their cause. Bolingbroke, on the otherhand, made the Duke of Ormond, whose sympathies were known to be infavour of the Pretender's succession, Warden of the Cinque Ports, thedistrict in which either claimant of the crown must land, while he gaveScotland in charge to the Jacobite Earl of Mar. The appointments wereprobably only to secure Jacobite support, for Bolingbroke had in fact noimmediate apprehensions of the Queen's death, and his aim was to trimbetween the Court of Hanover and the Court of James while building up astrong Tory party which would enable him to meet the accession of eitherwith a certainty of retaining power both for himself and the principleshe represented. With this view he was preparing to attack both the Bankand the East India Company, the two great strongholds of the Whigs, aswell as to tax the bondholders at higher rates than the rest of thecommunity by way of conciliating the country gentry, who hated themoneyed interest which was rising into greatness beside them. But eventsmoved faster than his plans. On the 30th of July, three days afterHarley's dismissal, Anne was suddenly struck with apoplexy. The PrivyCouncil at once assembled, and at the news the Whig Dukes of Argyle andSomerset entered the Council Chamber without summons and took theirplaces at the board. The step had been taken in secret concert with theDuke of Shrewsbury, who was President of the Council in the ToryMinistry, but a rival of Bolingbroke and an adherent of the Hanoveriansuccession. The act was a decisive one. The right of the House ofHanover was at once acknowledged, Shrewsbury was nominated as LordTreasurer by the Council, and the nomination was accepted by the dyingQueen. Bolingbroke, though he remained Secretary of State, suddenlyfound himself powerless and neglected while the Council took steps toprovide for the emergency. Four regiments were summoned to the capitalin the expectation of a civil war. But the Jacobites were hopeless andunprepared; and on the death of Anne on the evening of the 10th ofAugust, the Elector George of Hanover, who had become heir to the throneby his mother's death, was proclaimed as king of England without a showof opposition.CHAPTER IVTHE HOUSE OF HANOVER1714-1760[Sidenote: England's European position.]The accession of George the First marked a change in the position ofEngland as a member of the European Commonwealth. From the age of thePlantagenets to the age of the Revolution the country had stood apartfrom more than passing contact with the fortunes of the Continent; forif Wolsey had striven to make it an arbiter between France and the Houseof Austria the strain of the Reformation withdrew Henry and hissuccessor from any effective interference in the strife across theChannel; and in spite of the conflict with the Armada Elizabeth aimed atthe close as at the beginning of her reign mainly at keeping her realmas far as might be out of the struggle of western Europe against theambition of Spain. Its attitude of isolation was yet more marked whenEngland stood aloof from the Thirty Years' War, and after a fitfuloutbreak of energy under Cromwell looked idly on at the earlier effortsof Lewis the Fourteenth to become master of Europe. But with theRevolution this attitude became impossible. In driving out the StuartsWilliam had aimed mainly at enlisting England in the league againstFrance; and France backed his effort by espousing the cause of theexiled king. To prevent the undoing of all that the Revolution had doneEngland was forced to join the Great Alliance of the European peoples,and reluctantly as she was drawn into it she at once found herself itshead. Political and military genius set William and Marlborough in theforefront of the struggle; Lewis reeled beneath the shock of Blenheimand Ramillies; and shameful as were some of its incidents the Peace ofUtrecht left England the main barrier against the ambition of the Houseof Bourbon.Nor was this a position from which any change of domestic policy couldwithdraw her. So long as a Stuart pretender threatened the throne of theRevolution, so long every adherent of the cause of the Revolution,whether Tory or Whig, was forced to guard jealously against thesupremacy of the power which could alone bring about a Jacobiterestoration. As the one check on France lay in the maintenance of aEuropean concert, in her efforts to maintain this concert England wasdrawn out of the narrower circle of her own home interests to watchevery movement of the nations from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. Andnot only did the Revolution set England irrevocably among the powers ofEurope, but it assigned her a special place among them. The result ofthe alliance and the war had been to establish what was then called a"balance of power" between the great European states; a balance whichrested indeed not so much on any natural equilibrium of forces as on acompromise wrung from warring nations by the exhaustion of a greatstruggle; but which, once recognized and established, could be adaptedand readjusted, it was hoped, to the varying political conditions of thetime. Of this balance of power, as recognized and defined in the Treatyof Utrecht and its successors, England became the special guardian. Herinsular position made her almost the one great state which could have nodreams of continental aggrandizement; while the main aim of her policy,that of guarding the throne of the Revolution, secured her fidelity tothe European settlement which offered an insuperable obstacle to aJacobite invasion. Her only interest lay in the maintenance of Europeanpeace on the basis of an observance of European treaties.[Sidenote: Its results.]Nothing is at first sight more wearisome than the long line ofalliances, triple and quadruple, the endless negotiations, theinterminable congresses, the innumerable treaties, which make up thehistory of Europe during the earlier half of the eighteenth century; noris it easy to follow with patience the meddlesome activity of Englishdiplomacy during that period, its protests and interventions, itssubsidies and guarantees, its intrigues and finessings, its bluster andits lies. But wearisome as it all is, it succeeded in its end, and itsend was a noble one. Of the twenty-five years between the Revolution andthe Peace of Utrecht all but five were years of war, and the five were amere breathing-space in which the combatants on either side were girdingthemselves for fresh hostilities. That the twenty-five years whichfollowed were for Europe as a whole a time of peace was due in greatmeasure to the zeal with which England watched over the settlement thathad been brought about at Utrecht. To a great extent her efforts avertedwar altogether; and when war could not be averted she brought it withinas narrow limits and to as speedy an end as was possible. Diplomacyspent its ingenuity in countless choppings and changings of the smallerterritories about the Mediterranean and elsewhere; but till the rise ofPrussia under Frederick the Great it secured Europe as a whole from anyworld-wide struggle. Nor was this maintenance of European peace all thegain which the attitude of England brought with it. The stubborn policyof the Georgian statesmen has left its mark on our policy ever since. Instruggling for peace and for the sanctity of treaties, even though thestruggle was one of selfish interest, England took a ply which she hasnever wholly lost. Warlike and imperious as is her national temper, shehas never been able to free herself from a sense that her business inthe world is to seek peace alike for herself and for the nations abouther, and that the best security for peace lies in her recognition,amidst whatever difficulties and seductions, of the force ofinternational engagements and the sanctity of treaties. The sentimenthas no doubt been deepened by other convictions, by convictions of atonce a higher and a lower stamp, by a growing sense of the value ofpeace to an industrial nation, as by a growing sense of the moral eviland destructiveness of war. But strong as is the influence of both thesesentiments on the peace-loving temper of the English people, that temperitself sprang from another source. It sprang from the sense ofresponsibility for the peace of the world, as a necessary condition oftranquillity and freedom at home, which grew into life with the earlieryears of the eighteenth century.[Sidenote: England's intellectual influence.]Nor was this closer political contact with Europe the only result of thenew attitude of England. Throughout the age of the Georges we find herfor the first time exercising an intellectual and moral influence on theEuropean world. Hitherto Italian and French impulses had told on Englishletters or on English thought, but neither our literature nor ourphilosophy had exercised any corresponding influence on the Continent.It may be doubted whether a dozen Frenchmen or Italians had any notionthat a literature existed in England at all, or that her institutionswere worthy of study by any social or political inquirer. But with theRevolution of 1688 this ignorance came to an end. William andMarlborough carried more than English arms across the Channel; theycarried English ideas. The combination of material and militarygreatness with a freedom of thought and action hardly known elsewhere,which was revealed in the England that sprang from the Revolution of1688, imposed on the imagination of men. For the first time in ourhistory we find foreigners learning English, visiting England, seekingto understand English life and English opinion. The main curiosity thatdrew them was a political curiosity, but they carried back more thanpolitical conceptions. Religious and philosophical notions crossed theChannel with politics. The world learned that there was an Englishliterature. It heard of Shakspere. It wept over Richardson. It bowed,even in wretched translations, before the genius of Swift. France, aboveall, was drawn to this study of a country so near to her, and yet soutterly unknown. If we regard its issues, the brutal outrage which droveVoltaire to England in 1726 was one of the most important events of theeighteenth century. With an intelligence singularly open to newimpressions, he revelled in the freedom of social life he found abouthim, in its innumerable types of character, its eccentricities, itsindividualities. His "Philosophical Letters" revealed to Europe not onlya country where utterance and opinion were unfettered, but a newliterature and a new science; while his intercourse with Bolingbrokegave the first impulse to that scepticism which was to wage itsdestructive war with the faith of the Continent. From the visit ofVoltaire to the outbreak of the French Revolution, this intercourse withEngland remained the chief motive power of French opinion, and toldthrough it on the opinion of the world. In his investigations on thenature of government Montesquieu studied English institutions as closelyas he studied the institutions of Rome. Buffon was led by Englishscience into his attempt at a survey and classification of the animalworld. It was from the works of Locke that Rousseau drew the bulk of hisideas in politics and education.[Sidenote: The general temper of Europe.]Such an influence could hardly have been aroused by English letters hadthey not given expression to what was the general temper of Europe atthe time. The cessation of religious wars, the upgrowth of great stateswith a new political and administrative organization, the rapid progressof intelligence, showed their effect everywhere in the samerationalizing temper, extending not only over theology but over eachdepartment of thought, the same interest in political and socialspeculation, the same drift towards physical inquiry, the same tendencyto a diffusion and popularization of knowledge. Everywhere the tone ofthought became secular, scientific, prosaic; everywhere men looked awayfrom the past with a certain contempt; everywhere the social fusionwhich followed on the wreck of the Middle Ages was expressing itself ina vulgarization of ideas, in an appeal from the world of learning to theworld of general intelligence, in a reliance on the "common sense" ofmankind. Nor was it only a unity of spirit which pervaded the literatureof the eighteenth century. Everywhere there was as striking an identityof form. In poetry this showed itself in the death of the lyric, as inthe universal popularity of the rhetorical ode, in the loss of alldelight in variety of poetic measure, and in the growing restriction ofverse to the single form of the ten-syllable line. Prose too droppedeverywhere its grandeur with its obscurity; and became the same quick,clear instrument of thought in the hands of Addison as in those ofVoltaire.[Sidenote: Creation of a literary class.]How strongly this had become the bent of English letters was seen in theinstance of Dryden. In the struggle of the Revolution he had struckfiercely on the losing side, and England had answered his blows by achange of masters which ruined and beggared him. But it was in theselater years of his life that his influence over English literaturebecame supreme. He is the first of the great English writers in whomletters asserted an almost public importance. The reverence with whichmen touched in after-time the hand of Pope, or listened to the voice ofJohnson, or wandered beside his lakes with Wordsworth, dates from thedays when the wits of the Revolution clustered reverently round the oldman who sate in his armchair at Will's discussing the last comedy, orrecalling his visit to the blind poet of the "Paradise Lost." It was byno mere figure that the group called itself a republic of letters, andhonoured in Dryden the chosen chief of their republic. He had done morethan any man to create a literary class. It was his resolve to live byhis pen that first raised literature into a profession. In the stead ofgentlemen amusing a curious leisure with works of fancy, or Dependantswringing bread by their genius from a patron's caprice, Dryden saw thatthe time had come for the author, trusting for support to the world ofreaders, and wielding a power over opinion which compensates for thesmallness of his gains. But he was not only the first to create aliterary class; he was the first to impress the idea of literature onthe English mind. Master as he was alike of poetry and of prose,covering the fields both of imagination and criticism, seizing forliterary treatment all the more prominent topics of the society abouthim, Dryden realized in his own personality the existence of a newpower which was thenceforth to tell steadily on the world.[Sidenote: The new poetry.]And to this power he gave for nearly a century its form and direction.In its outer shape as in its inner spirit our literature obeyed theimpulse he had given it from the beginning of the eighteenth centurytill near its close. His influence told especially on poetry. Drydenremained a poet; even in his most argumentative pieces his subjectseizes him in a poetic way, and prosaic as much of his treatment may be,he is always ready to rise into sudden bursts of imagery and fancy. Buthe was a poet with a prosaic end; his aim was not simply to expressbeautiful things in the most beautiful way, but to invest rationalthings with such an amount of poetic expression as may make them at oncerational and poetic, to use poetry as an exquisite form for argument,rhetoric, persuasion, to charm indeed, but primarily to convince. Poetryno longer held itself apart in the pure world of the imagination, nolonger concerned itself simply with the beautiful in all things, orsought for its result in the sense of pleasure which an exquisiterepresentation of what is beautiful in man or nature stirs in itsreader. It narrowed its sphere, and attached itself to man. But from allthat is deepest and noblest in man it was shut off by the reaction fromPuritanism, by the weariness of religious strife, by the disbelief thathad sprung from religious controversy; and it limited itself rigidly toman's outer life, to his sensuous enjoyment, his toil and labour, hispolitics, his society. The limitation, no doubt, had its good sides;with it, if not of it, came a greater correctness and precision in theuse of words and phrases, a clearer and more perspicuous style, a newsense of order, of just arrangement, of propriety, of good taste. Butwith it came a sense of uniformity, of monotony, of dulness. In Drydenindeed this was combated if not wholly beaten off by his amazing force;to the last there was an animal verve and swing about the man thatconquered age. But around him and after him the dulness gathered fast.[Sidenote: The new prose.]Of hardly less moment than Dryden's work in poetry was his work inprose. In continuity and grandeur indeed, as in grace and music ofphrase, the new prose of the Restoration fell far short of the prose ofHooker or Jeremy Taylor, but its clear nervous structure, its handinessand flexibility, its variety and ease, fitted it far better for the workof popularization on which literature was now to enter. It fitted it forthe work of journalism, and every day journalism was playing a largerpart in the political education of Englishmen. It fitted it to expressthe life of towns. With the general extension of prosperity and tradethe town was coming into greater prominence as an element of nationallife; and London above all was drawing to it the wealth and culturewhich had till now been diffused through the people at large. It wasnatural that this tendency should be reflected in literature; from theage of the Restoration indeed literature had been more and more becomingan expression of the life of towns; and it was town-life which was nowgiving to it its character and form. As cities ceased to be regardedsimply as centres of trade and money-getting, and became habitual homesfor the richer and more cultured; as men woke to the pleasure andfreedom of the new life which developed itself in the street and themall, of its quicker movement, its greater ease, its abundance of socialintercourse, its keener taste, its subtler and more delicate courtesy,its flow of conversation, the stately and somewhat tedious prose-writerof days gone by passed into the briefer and nimbler essayist.[Sidenote: The Essayists.]What ruled writer and reader alike was the new-found pleasure of talk.The use of coffee had only come in at the close of the civil wars; butalready London and the bigger towns were crowded with coffee-houses. Thepopularity of the coffee-house sprang not from its coffee, but from thenew pleasure which men found in their chat over the coffee-cup. And fromthe coffee-house sprang the Essay. The talk of Addison and Steele is thebrightest and easiest talk that was ever put in print: but its literarycharm lies in this, that it is strictly talk. The essayist is agentleman who chats to a world of gentlemen, and whose chat is shapedand coloured by a sense of what he owes to his company. He must interestand entertain, he may not bore them; and so his form must be short;essay or sketch, or tale or letter. So too his style must be simple, thesentences clear and quotable, good sense ready packed for carriage.Strength of phrase, intricacy of structure, height of tone were allnecessarily banished from such prose as we banish them from ordinaryconversation. There was no room for pedantry, for the ostentatiousdisplay of learning, for pompousness, for affectation. The essayist hadto think, as a talker should think, more of good taste than ofimaginative excellence, of propriety of expression than of grandeur ofphrase. The deeper themes of the world or man were denied to him; if hetouches them it is superficially, with a decorous dulness, or on theirmore humorous side with a gentle irony that shows how faint their holdis on him. In Addison's chat the war of churches shrinks into apuppet-show, and the strife of politics loses something of itsfictitious earnestness as the humourist views it from the standpoint ofa lady's patches. It was equally impossible to deal with the fiercerpassions and subtler emotions of man. Shakspere's humour and sublimity,his fitful transitions from mood to mood, his wild bursts of laughter,his passion of tears, Hamlet or Hamlet's gravedigger, Lear or Lear'sfool, would have startled the readers of the "Spectator" as they wouldstartle the group in a modern drawing-room.[Sidenote: The urbanity of Literature.]But if deeper and grander themes were denied him the essayist had stilla world of his own. He felt little of the pressure of those spiritualproblems that had weighed on the temper of his fathers, but the removalof the pressure left him a gay, light-hearted, good-humoured observer ofthe social life about him, amused and glad to be amused by it all,looking on with a leisurely and somewhat indolent interest, a quietenjoyment, a quiet scepticism, a shy reserved consciousness of theirbeauty and poetry, at the lives of common men and common women. It is tothe essayist that we owe our sense of the infinite variety andpicturesqueness of the human world about us; it was he who for the firsttime made every street and every house teem with living people for us,who found a subtle interest in their bigotries and prejudice, theirinconsistencies, their eccentricities, their oddities, who gave to theirvery dulness a charm. In a word it was he who first opened to men theworld of modern fiction. Nor does English literature owe less to him inits form. Humour has always been an English quality, but with theessayist humour for the first time severed itself from farce; it was nolonger forced, riotous, extravagant; it acquired taste, gentleness,adroitness, finesse, lightness of touch, a delicate colouring ofplayful fancy. It preserved indeed its old sympathy with pity, withpassion; but it learned how to pass with more ease into pathos, intolove, into the reverence that touches us as we smile. And hand in handwith this new developement of humour went a moderation won from humour,whether in matters of religion, of politics, or society, a literarycourtesy and reserve, a well-bred temperance and modesty of tone andphrase. It was in the hands of the town-bred essayist that ourliterature first became urbane.[Sidenote: The brutality of Politics.]It is strange to contrast this urbanity of literature with the savageferocity which characterized political controversy in the England of theRevolution and the Georges. Never has the strife of warring parties beencarried on with so utter an absence of truth or fairness; never has thelanguage of political opponents stooped to such depths of coarseness andscurrility. From the age of Bolingbroke to the age of Burke the graveststatesmen were not ashamed to revile one another with invective onlyworthy of the fish-market. And outside the legislature the tone ofattack was even more brutal. Grub Street ransacked the whole vocabularyof abuse to find epithets for Walpole. Gay amidst general applause setthe statesmen of his day on the public stage in the guise of highwaymenand pickpockets. "It is difficult to determine," said the wittyplaywright, "whether the fine gentlemen imitate the gentlemen of theroad, or the gentlemen of the road the fine gentlemen." Much of thisvirulence sprang, no doubt, from a real contempt of the selfishness andcorruption which disgraced the politics of the time, but it was far frombeing wholly due to this. In selfishness and corruption indeed thestatesmen of the Georgian era were no worse than their predecessors;while in fidelity to principles and a desire for the public good theystood immeasurably above them. The standard of political action hadrisen with the Revolution. Cynic as was Walpole, jobber as wasNewcastle, it would be absurd to compare their conception of publicduty, their conduct of public affairs, with that of the Danbys andSunderlands of the Restoration.[Sidenote: Public opinion.]What had really happened was a change not in the attitude of statesmentowards the nation, but in the attitude of the nation at large towardsthe class that governed it. From the triumph of Puritanism in 1640 thesupreme, irresistible force in English politics had been nationalopinion. It created the Long Parliament. It gave it its victory over theChurch and the Crown. When a strange turn of events placed Puritanism inantagonism to it, it crushed Puritanism as easily as it had crushedRoyalty. It was national opinion which restored the Stuarts; and nosooner did the Stuarts cross its will than it threatened their throne inthe Popish Plot and swept them from the country in the Revolution. Thestubborn purpose of William wrestled in vain with its turns ofsentiment; even the genius of Marlborough proved helpless in a contestwith it. It was indeed irresistible whenever it acted. But as yet itacted only by spurts. It had no wish to interfere with the generalcourse of administration or policy; in the bulk of the nation indeedthere was neither the political knowledge nor the sustained interest inpolitics which could have prompted such an interference. It was only atcritical moments, when great interests were at stake, interests which itcould understand and on which its mind was made up, that the nationroused itself and "shook its mighty mane." The reign of the Stuartsindeed did much to create a more general and continuous attention topublic affairs. In the strife of the Exclusion Bill and in the PopishPlot Shaftesbury taught how to "agitate" opinion, how to rouse thislagging attention, this dormant energy of the people at large; and hisopponents learned the art from him. The common statement that our twogreat modern parties, the Whig and the Tory, date from the Petitionersand Abhorrers of the Exclusion Bill is true only in this sense, thatthen for the first time the masses of the people were stirred to a moreprolonged and organized action in co-operation with the smaller groupsof professed politicians than they had ever been stirred to before.[Sidenote: Becomes powerless.]The Revolution of 1688 was the crowning triumph of this public opinion.But for the time it seemed a suicidal triumph. At the moment when thenational will claimed to be omnipotent, the nation found itself helplessto carry out its will. In making the revolution it had meant tovindicate English freedom and English Protestantism from the attacks ofthe Crown. But it had never meant to bring about any radical change inthe system under which the Crown had governed England or under which theChurch had been supreme over English religion. The England of theRevolution was little less Tory in feeling than the England of theRestoration; it had no dislike whatever to a large exercise ofadministrative power by the sovereign, while it was stubbornly aversefrom Nonconformity or the toleration of Nonconformity. That the nationat large remained Tory in sentiment was seen from the fact that in everyHouse of Commons elected after the Revolution the majority was commonlyTory; it was only indeed when their opposition to the war and thepatriotic feeling which it aroused rendered a Tory majority impossiblethat the House became Whig. And even in the height of Whig rule andamidst the blaze of Whig victories, England rose in the Sacheverellriots, forced Tories again into power, and ended the Whig war by what itdeemed a Tory peace. And yet every Englishman knew that from the momentof the Revolution the whole system of government had not been Tory butWhig. Passionate as it was for peace and for withdrawal from allmeddling in foreign affairs, England found itself involved abroad inever-widening warfare and drawn into a guardianship of the whole stateof Europe. At home it was drifting along a path that it hated even more.Every year saw the Crown more helpless, and the Church becoming ashelpless as the Crown. The country hated a standing army, and thestanding army existed in spite of its hate; it revolted against debt andtaxation, and taxes and debt grew heavier and heavier in the teeth ofits revolt. Its prejudice against Nonconformists remained as fanaticalas ever, and yet Nonconformists worshipped in their chapels and servedas aldermen or mayors with perfect security. What made this the bittererwas the fact that neither a change of ministers nor of sovereign broughtabout any in the system of government. Under the Tory Anne the policy ofEngland remained practically as Whig as under the Whig William.Nottingham and Harley did as little to restore the monarchy or theChurch as Somers or Godolphin.[Sidenote: Helplessness of the Tories.]In driving James to a foreign land, indeed, in making him dependent on aforeign Court, the Revolution had effectually guarded itself from anyundoing of its work. So long as a Stuart Pretender existed, so long ashe remained a tool in the hands of France, every monarch that theRevolution placed on the English throne, and every servant of such amonarch, was forced to cling to the principles of the Revolution and tothe men who were most certain to fight for them. With a Parliament oflanded gentry and Churchmen behind him Harley could not be drawn intomeasures which would effectively alienate the merchant or the Dissenter;and if Bolingbroke's talk was more reckless, time was not given to showwhether his designs were more than talk. There was in fact but onecourse open for the Tory who hated what the Revolution had done, andthat was the recall of the Stuarts. Such a recall would have brought himmuch of what he wanted. But it would have brought him more that he didnot want. Tory as he might be, he was in no humour to sacrifice Englishfreedom and English religion to his Toryism, and to recall the Stuartswas to sacrifice both. None of the Stuart exiles would forsake theirfaith; and, promise what they might, England had learned too well whatsuch pledges were worth to set another Catholic on the throne. The moreearnest a Catholic he was indeed, and no one disputed the earnestness ofthe Stuarts, the more impossible was it for him to reign withoutstriving to bring England over to Catholicism; and there was no means ofeven making such an attempt save by repeating the struggle of James theSecond and by the overthrow of English liberty. It was theconsciousness that a Stuart restoration was impossible that eggedBolingbroke to his desperate plans for forcing a Tory policy on themonarchs of the Revolution. And it was the same consciousness that atthe crisis which followed the death of Anne made the Tory leaders deafto the frantic appeals of Bishop Atterbury. To submit again to Whig rulewas a bitter thing for them; but to accept a Catholic sovereign was animpossible thing. And yet every Tory felt that with the acceptance ofthe House of Hanover their struggle against the principles of theRevolution came practically to an end. Their intrigues with thePretender, the strife which they had brought about between Anne and theElectress Sophia, their hesitation if not their refusal to franklysupport the succession of her son, were known to have sown a deepdistrust of the whole Tory party in the heart of the new sovereign; andthough in the first ministry which he formed a few posts were offered tothe more moderate of their leaders, the offer was so clearly a delusiveone that they refused to take office.[Sidenote: Withdrawal of the Tories.]The refusal not only deepened the chasm between party and party; itplaced the Tories in open opposition to the Hanoverian kings. It dideven more, for it proclaimed a temper of despair which withdrew them asa whole from any further meddling with political affairs. "The Toryparty," Bolingbroke wrote after Anne's death, "is gone." In the firstHouse of Commons indeed which was called by the new king, the Torieshardly numbered fifty members; while a fatal division broke theirstrength in the country at large. In their despair the more vehementamong them turned to the Pretender. Bolingbroke and the Duke of Ormondfled from England to take office under the son of King James, James theThird, as he was called by his adherents. At home Sir William Wyndhamseconded their efforts by building up a Jacobite faction out of thewreck of the Tory party. The Jacobite secession gave little help to thePretender, while it dealt a fatal blow to the Tory cause. England wasstill averse from a return of the Stuarts; and the suspicion of Jacobitedesigns not only alienated the trading classes, who shrank from the blowto public credit which a Jacobite repudiation of the debt would bringabout, but deadened the zeal even of the parsons and squires. The bulkhowever of the Tory party were far from turning Jacobites, though theymight play at disloyalty out of hatred of the House of Hanover, andsolace themselves for the triumph of their opponents by passing thedecanter over the water-jug at the toast of "the King." What they didwas to withdraw from public affairs altogether; to hunt and farm andappear at quarter-sessions, and to leave the work of government to theWhigs.[Sidenote: The Whigs and the Church.]While the Whigs were thus freed from any effective pressure from theirpolitical opponents they found one of their great difficulties becomingweaker with every year that passed. Up to this time the mainstumbling-block to the Whig party had been the influence of the Church.But predominant as that influence seemed at the close of the Revolution,the Church was now sinking into political insignificance. In heartindeed England remained religious. In the middle class the old Puritanspirit lived on unchanged, and it was from this class that a religiousrevival burst forth at the close of Walpole's administration whichchanged after a time the whole tone of English society. But during thefifty years which preceded this outburst we see little save a revoltagainst religion and against churches in either the higher classes orthe poor. Among the wealthier and more educated Englishmen the progressof free inquiry, the aversion from theological strife which had beenleft behind them by the Civil Wars, the new political and materialchannels opened to human energy were producing a general indifference toall questions of religious speculation or religious life. In the highercircles "every one laughs," said Montesquieu on his visit to England,"if one talks of religion." Of the prominent statesmen of the time thegreater part were unbelievers in any form of Christianity, anddistinguished for the grossness and immorality of their lives.Drunkenness and foul talk were thought no discredit to Walpole. A laterprime minister, the Duke of Grafton, was in the habit of appearing withhis mistress at the play. Purity and fidelity to the marriage vow weresneered out of fashion; and Lord Chesterfield, in his letters to hisson, instructs him in the art of seduction as part of a politeeducation.[Sidenote: Sloth of the clergy.]At the other end of the social scale lay the masses of the poor. Theywere ignorant and brutal to a degree which it is hard to conceive, forthe increase of population which followed on the growth of towns and thedevelopement of commerce had been met by no effort for their religiousor educational improvement. Not a new parish had been created. Hardly asingle new church had been built. Schools there were none, save thegrammar schools of Edward and Elizabeth. The rural peasantry, who werefast being reduced to pauperism by the abuse of the poor-laws, were leftwithout much moral or religious training of any sort. "We saw but oneBible in the parish of Cheddar," said Hannah More at a far later time,"and that was used to prop a flower-pot." Within the towns things wereworse. There was no effective police; and in great outbreaks the mob ofLondon or Birmingham burnt houses, flung open prisons, and sacked andpillaged at their will. The criminal class gathered boldness and numbersin the face of ruthless laws which only testified to the terror ofsociety, laws which made it a capital crime to cut down a cherry tree,and which strung up twenty young thieves of a morning in front ofNewgate; while the introduction of gin gave a new impetus todrunkenness. In the streets of London gin-shops at one time invitedevery passer-by to get drunk for a penny, or dead drunk for twopence.Much of this social degradation was due without doubt to the apathy andsloth of the priesthood. A shrewd, if prejudiced, observer, BishopBurnet, brands the English clergy of his day as the most lifeless inEurope, "the most remiss of their labours in private and the leastsevere of their lives." A large number of prelates were mere Whigpartizans with no higher aim than that of promotion. The levees of theMinisters were crowded with lawn sleeves. A Welsh bishop avowed that hehad seen his diocese but once, and habitually resided at the lakes ofWestmoreland. The system of pluralities which enabled a single clergymanto hold at the same time a number of livings turned the wealthier andmore learned of the clergy into absentees, while the bulk of them wereindolent, poor, and without social consideration.[Sidenote: The clergy lose political power.]Their religious inactivity told necessarily on their politicalinfluence; but what most weakened their influence was the severancebetween the bulk of the priesthood and its natural leaders. The bishops,who were now chosen exclusively from among the small number of Whigecclesiastics, were left politically powerless by the estrangement andhatred of their clergy; while the clergy themselves, drawn by theirsecret tendencies to Jacobitism, stood sulkily apart from any activeinterference with public affairs. The prudence of the Whig statesmenaided to maintain this ecclesiastical immobility. The Sacheverell riotshad taught them what terrible forces of bigotry and fanaticism layslumbering under this thin crust of inaction, and they were careful toavoid all that could rouse these forces into life. When the Dissenterspressed for a repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, Walpole openlyavowed his dread of awaking the passions of religious hate by such ameasure, and satisfied them by an annual act of indemnity for any breachof these penal statutes. By a complete abstinence from allecclesiastical questions no outlet was left for the bigotry of thepeople at large, while a suspension of the meetings of Convocationdeprived the clergy of their natural centre of agitation and opposition.[Sidenote: The Whigs and the Crown.]And while the Church thus ceased to be a formidable enemy, the Crownbecame a friend. Under Anne the throne had regained much of the olderinfluence which it lost through William's unpopularity; but under thetwo sovereigns who followed Anne the power of the Crown lay absolutelydormant. They were strangers, to whom loyalty in its personal sense wasimpossible; and their character as nearly approached insignificance asit is possible for human character to approach it. Both were honest andstraightforward men, who frankly accepted the irksome position ofconstitutional kings. But neither had any qualities which could maketheir honesty attractive to the people at large. The temper of Georgethe First was that of a gentleman usher; and his one care was to getmoney for his favourites and himself. The temper of George the Secondwas that of a drill-sergeant, who believed himself master of his realmwhile he repeated the lessons he had learned from his wife, and whichhis wife had learned from the Minister. Their Court is familiar enoughin the witty memoirs of the time; but as political figures the twoGeorges are almost absent from our history. William of Orange, whileruling in most home matters by the advice of his Ministers, had not onlyused the power of rejecting bills passed by the two Houses, but had keptin his own hands the control of foreign affairs. Anne had never yieldedeven to Marlborough her exclusive right of dealing with Churchpreferment, and had presided to the last at the Cabinet Councils of herministers. But with the accession of the Georges these reserves passedaway. No sovereign since Anne's death has appeared at a Cabinet Council,or has ventured to refuse his assent to an Act of Parliament. AsElector of Hanover indeed the king still dealt with Continental affairs:but his personal interference roused an increasing jealousy, while itaffected in a very slight degree the foreign policy of his Englishcounsellors.England, in short, was governed not by the king but by the WhigMinisters. But their power was doubled by the steady support of the verykings they displaced. The first two sovereigns of the House of Hanoverbelieved they owed their throne to the Whigs, and looked on the supportof the Whigs as the true basis of their monarchy. The new monarchs hadno longer to dread the spectre of republicanism which had haunted theStuarts and even Anne, whenever a Whig domination threatened her; forrepublicanism was dead. Nor was there the older anxiety as to theprerogative to sever the monarchy from the Whigs, for the bounds of theprerogative were now defined by law, and the Whigs were as zealous asany Tory could be in preserving what remained. From the accession ofGeorge the First therefore to the death of George the Second the wholeinfluence of the Crown was thrown into the Whig scale; and if its directpower was gone, its indirect influence was still powerful. It was indeedthe more powerful that the Revolution had put an end to the dread thatits influence could be used in any struggle against liberty. "Thegenerality of the world here," said the new Whig Chancellor, LordCowper, to King George, "is so much in love with the advantages a kingof Great Britain has to bestow without the least exceeding the bounds oflaw, that 'tis wholly in your majesty's power, by showing your power ingood time to one or other of them, to give which party you please aclear majority in all succeeding parliaments."[Sidenote: The Whigs and Parliament.]It was no wonder therefore that in the first of the new king'sparliaments an overwhelming majority appeared in support of the Whigs.But the continuance of that majority for more than thirty years was notwholly due to the unswerving support which the Crown gave its Ministersor to the secession of the Tories. In some measure it was due to theexcellent organization of the Whig party. While their adversaries weredivided by differences of principle and without leaders of realeminence, the Whigs stood as one man on the principles of the Revolutionand produced great leaders who carried them into effect. They submittedwith admirable discipline to the guidance of a knot of great nobles, tothe houses of Bentinck, Manners, Campbell, and Cavendish, to theFitzroys and Lennoxes, the Russells and Grenvilles, families whoseresistance to the Stuarts, whose share in the Revolution, whose energyin setting the line of Hanover on the throne, gave them a claim topower. It was due yet more largely to the activity with which the Whigsdevoted themselves to the gaining and preserving an ascendency in theHouse of Commons. The support of the commercial classes and of the greattowns was secured not only by a resolute maintenance of public credit,but by the special attention which each ministry paid to questions oftrade and finance. Peace and the reduction of the land-tax conciliatedthe farmers and the landowners, while the Jacobite sympathies of thebulk of the squires, and their consequent withdrawal from all share inpolitics, threw even the representation of the shires for a time intoWhig hands. Of the county members, who formed the less numerous but theweightier part of the lower House, nine-tenths were for some yearsrelatives and dependents of the great Whig families. Nor were coarsermeans of controlling Parliament neglected. The wealth of the Whig houseswas lavishly spent in securing a monopoly of the small and corruptconstituencies which made up a large part of the borough representation.It was spent yet more unscrupulously in parliamentary bribery.Corruption was older than Walpole or the Whig Ministers, for it sprangout of the very transfer of power to the House of Commons which hadbegun with the Restoration. The transfer was complete, and the House wassupreme in the State; but while freeing itself from the control of theCrown, it was as yet imperfectly responsible to the people. It was onlyat election time that a member felt the pressure of public opinion. Thesecrecy of parliamentary proceedings, which had been needful as asafeguard against royal interference with debate, served as a safeguardagainst interference on the part of constituencies. This strange unionof immense power with absolute freedom from responsibility brought aboutits natural results in the bulk of members. A vote was too valuable tobe given without recompense, and parliamentary support had to be boughtby places, pensions, and bribes in hard cash.But dexterous as was their management, and compact as was theirorganization, it was to nobler qualities than these that the Whigs owedtheir long rule over England. Factious and selfish as much of theirconduct proved, they were true to their principles, and their principleswere those for which England had been struggling through two hundredyears. The right to free government, to freedom of conscience, and tofreedom of speech, had been declared indeed in the Revolution of 1688.But these rights owe their definite establishment as the recognizedbasis of national life and national action to the age of the Georges. Itwas the long and unbroken fidelity to free principles with which theWhig administration was conducted that made constitutional government apart of the very life of Englishmen. It was their government of Englandyear after year on the principles of the Revolution that convertedthese principles into national habits. Before their long rule was overEnglishmen had forgotten that it was possible to persecute fordifference of opinion, or to put down the liberty of the press, or totamper with the administration of justice, or to rule without aParliament.[Sidenote: Robert Walpole.]That this policy was so firmly grasped and so steadily carried out wasdue above all to the genius of Robert Walpole. Walpole was born in 1676;and he had entered Parliament two years before the death of William ofOrange as a young Norfolk landowner of fair fortune, with the tastes andair of the class from which he sprang. His big, square figure, hisvulgar good-humoured face were those of a common country squire. And inWalpole the squire underlay the statesman to the last. He was ignorantof books, he "loved neither writing nor reading," and if he had a tastefor art, his real love was for the table, the bottle, and the chase. Herode as hard as he drank. Even in moments of political peril, the firstdespatch he would open was the letter from his gamekeeper. There was thetemper of the Norfolk fox-hunter in the "doggedness" which Marlboroughnoted as his characteristic, in the burly self-confidence which declared"If I had not been Prime Minister I should have been Archbishop ofCanterbury," in the stubborn courage which conquered the awkwardness ofhis earlier efforts to speak or met single-handed at the last the bitterattacks of a host of enemies. There was the same temper in the genialgood-humour which became with him a new force in politics. No man wasever more fiercely attacked by speakers and writers, but he brought inno "gagging Act" for the press; and though the lives of most of hisassailants were in his hands through their intrigues with the Pretender,he made little use of his power over them.[Sidenote: His policy.]Where his country breeding showed itself most, however, was in theshrewd, narrow, honest character of his mind. Though he saw veryclearly, he could not see far, and he would not believe what he couldnot see. His prosaic good sense turned sceptically away from the poeticand passionate sides of human feeling. Appeals to the loftier or purermotives of action he laughed at as "schoolboy nights." For young memberswho talked of public virtue or patriotism he had one good-naturedanswer: "You will soon come off that and grow wiser." But he wasthoroughly straightforward and true to his own convictions, so far asthey went. "Robin and I are two honest men," the Jacobite Shippen ownedin later years, when contrasting him with his factious opponents: "he isfor King George and I am for King James, but those men with long cravatsonly desire place either under King George or King James." What markedhim off from his fellow-Whigs however was not so much the clearness withwhich Walpole saw the value of the political results which theRevolution had won, or the fidelity with which he carried out his"Revolution principles"; it was the sagacity with which he grasped theconditions on which alone England could be brought to a quiet acceptanceof both of them. He never hid from himself that, weakened and broken asit was, Toryism, lived on in the bulk of the nation as a spirit ofsullen opposition, an opposition that could not rise into active revoltso long as the Pretender remained a Catholic, but which fed itself withhopes of a Stuart who would at last befriend English religion andEnglish liberty, and which in the meanwhile lay ready to give force andvirulence to any outbreak of strife at home. On a temper such as thisargument was wasted. The only agency that could deal with it was theagency of time, the slow wearing away of prejudice, the slow upgrowth ofnew ideas, the gradual conviction that a Stuart restoration washopeless, the as gradual recognition of the benefits which had been wonby the Revolution, and which were secured by the maintenance of theHouse of Hanover upon the throne.[Sidenote: The Townshend Ministry.]Such a transition would be hindered or delayed by every outbreak ofpolitical or religious controversy that changes or reforms, however wisein themselves, must necessarily bring with them; and Walpole held thatno reform was as important to the country at large as a nationalreunion and settlement. Not less keen and steady was his sense of thenecessity of external peace. To provoke or to suffer new struggles onthe Continent was not only to rouse fresh resentment in a people whostill longed to withdraw from all part in foreign wars; it was to givefresh force to the Pretender by forcing France to use him as a toolagainst England, and to give fresh life to Jacobitism by stirring freshhopes of the Pretender's return. It was for this reason that Walpoleclung steadily to a policy of peace. But it was not at once that hecould force such a policy either on the Whig party or on the king.Though his vigour in the cause of his party had earned him the bitterhostility of the Tories in the later years of Anne, and a trumped-upcharge of peculation had served in 1712 as a pretext for expelling himfrom the House and committing him to the Tower, at the accession ofGeorge the First Walpole was far from holding the commanding position hewas soon to assume. The stage indeed was partly cleared for him by thejealousy with which the new sovereign regarded the men who had till nowserved as chiefs of the Whigs. Though the first Hanoverian Ministry wasdrawn wholly from the Whig party, its leaders and Marlborough foundthemselves alike set aside. But even had they regained their old power,time must soon have removed them; for Wharton and Halifax died in 1715,and 1716 saw the death of Somers and the imbecility of Marlborough. Theman to whom the king entrusted the direction of affairs was the newSecretary of State, Lord Townshend. His merit with George the First layin his having negotiated a Barrier Treaty with Holland in 1709 by whichthe Dutch were secured in the possession of a greater number offortresses in the Netherlands than they had garrisoned before the war,on condition of their guaranteeing the succession of the House ofHanover. The king had always looked on this treaty as the great supportof his cause, and on its negotiation as representing that union ofHolland, Hanover, and the Whigs, to which he owed his throne.Townshend's fellow Secretary was General Stanhope, who had won fame bothas a soldier and a politician, and who was now raised to the peerage. Itwas as Townshend's brother-in-law, rather than from a sense of hisactual ability, that Walpole successively occupied the posts ofPaymaster of the Forces, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and First Lord ofthe Treasury, in the new administration.[Sidenote: The rising of 1715.]The first work of the new Ministry was to meet a desperate attempt ofthe Pretender to gain the throne. There was no real hope of success, forthe active Jacobites in England were few, and the Tories were broken anddispirited by the fall of their leaders. The policy of Bolingbroke, asSecretary of State to the Pretender, was to defer action till he hadsecured help from Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, and had induced Lewisthe Fourteenth to lend a few thousand men to aid a Jacobite rising. Butat the moment of action the death of Lewis ruined all hope of aid fromFrance; the hope of Swedish aid proved as fruitless; and in spite ofBolingbroke's counsels James Stuart resolved to act alone. Withoutinforming his new Minister, he ordered the Earl of Mar to give thesignal for revolt in the North. In Scotland the triumph of the Whigsmeant the continuance of the House of Argyle in power; and the rivalHighland clans were as ready to fight the Campbells under Mar as theyhad been ready to fight them under Dundee or Montrose. But Mar was aleader of a different stamp from these. In September 1715 six thousandHighlanders joined him at Perth, but his cowardice or want of conductkept his army idle till the Duke of Argyle had gathered forces to meetit in an indecisive engagement at Sheriffmuir. The Pretender, whoarrived too late for the action, proved a yet more sluggish andincapable leader than Mar: and at the close of the year an advance ofsix thousand men under General Carpenter drove James over-sea again anddispersed the clans to their hills. In England the danger passed awaylike a dream. The accession of the new king had been followed by someoutbreaks of riotous discontent; but at the talk of Highland risingsand French invasions Tories and Whigs alike rallied round the throne;while the army, which had bitterly resented the interruption of itsvictories by the treachery of St. John, and hailed with delight therestoration of Marlborough to its command, went hotly for King George.The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and the arrest of their leader,Sir William Wyndham, cowed the Jacobites; and not a man stirred in thewest when Ormond appeared off the coast of Devon and called on his partyto rise. Oxford alone, where the University was a hotbed of Jacobitism,showed itself restless; and a few of the Catholic gentry rose inNorthumberland, under Lord Derwentwater and Mr. Forster. The arrival oftwo thousand Highlanders who had been sent to join them by Mar spurredthese insurgents to march into Lancashire, where the Catholic party wasstrongest; but they were soon cooped up in Preston, and driven to asurrender.[Sidenote: England and France.]The Ministry availed itself of their triumph to gratify theNonconformists by a repeal of the Schism and Occasional Conformity Acts,and to venture on a great constitutional change. Under the TriennialBill in William's reign the duration of a Parliament was limited tothree years. Now that the House of Commons however was become the rulingpower in the State, a change was absolutely required to securesteadiness and fixity of political action; and in 1716 this necessitycoincided with the desire of the Whigs to maintain in power a thoroughlyWhig Parliament. The duration of Parliament was therefore extended toseven years by the Septennial Bill. But while the Jacobite risingproduced these important changes at home, it brought about a yet moremomentous change in English policy abroad. The foresight of William theThird in his attempt to secure European peace by an alliance of thethree Western powers, France, Holland, and England, was justified by therealization of his policy under George the First. The new triplealliance was brought about by the practical advantages which it directlyoffered to the rulers in both England and France, as well as by theactual position of European politics. The landing of James in Scotlandhad quickened the anxiety of King George for his removal to a moredistant refuge than Lorraine, and for the entire detachment of Francefrom his cause. In France on the other hand a political revolution hadbeen caused by the death of Lewis the Fourteenth, which took place inSeptember 1715, at the very hour of the Jacobite outbreak. From thatmoment the country had been ruled by the Duke of Orleans as Regent forthe young King Lewis the Fifteenth. The boy's health was weak; and theDuke stood next to him in the succession to the crown, if Philip ofSpain observed the renunciation of his rights which he had made in theTreaty of Utrecht. It was well known however that Philip had no notionof observing this renunciation, and that he was already intriguing witha strong party in France against the hopes as well as the actual powerof the Duke. Nor was Spain more inclined to adhere to its ownrenunciations in the Treaty than its king. The constant dream of everySpaniard was to recover all that Spain had given up, to win back herItalian dependencies, to win back Gibraltar where the English flag wavedupon Spanish soil, to win back, above all, that monopoly of commercewith her dominions in America which England was now entitled to break inupon by the provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht.[Sidenote: Their alliance against Spain.]To attempt such a recovery was to defy Europe; for if the Treaty hadstripped Spain of its fairest dependencies, it had enriched almost everyEuropean state with its spoils. Savoy had gained Sicily; the Emperorheld the Netherlands, with Naples and the Milanese; Holland looked onthe Barrier fortresses as vital to its own security; England, if as yetindifferent to the value of Gibraltar, clung tenaciously to the AmericanTrade. But the boldness of Cardinal Alberoni, who was now the SpanishMinister, accepted the risk; and while his master was intriguing againstthe Regent in France, Alberoni promised aid to the Jacobite cause as ameans of preventing the interference of England with his designs. Inspite of failure in both countries he resolved boldly on an attempt torecover the Italian provinces which Philip had lost. He selected theDuke of Savoy as the weakest of his opponents; and armaments greaterthan Spain had seen for a century put to sea in 1717, and reduced theisland of Sardinia. The blow however was hardly needed to draw Englandand France together. The Abbe Dubois, a confidant of the Regent, hadalready met the English King with his Secretary, Lord Stanhope, at theHague; and entered into a compact, by which France guaranteed theHanoverian line in England, and England the succession of the house ofOrleans should Lewis the Fifteenth die without heirs. The two powerswere joined, though unwillingly, by Holland in an alliance, which wasconcluded on the basis of this compact; and, as in William's time, theexistence of this alliance told on the whole aspect of Europeanpolitics. Though in the summer of 1718 a strong Spanish force landed inSicily, and made itself master of the island, the appearance of anEnglish squadron in the Straits of Messina was followed by an engagementin which the Spanish fleet was all but destroyed. Alberoni strove toavenge the blow by fitting out an armament of five thousand men, whichthe Duke of Ormond was to command, for a revival of the Jacobite risingin Scotland. But the ships were wrecked in the Bay of Biscay; and theaccession of Austria with Savoy to the Triple Alliance, with the deathof the king of Sweden, left Spain alone in the face of Europe. Theprogress of the French armies in the north of Spain forced Philip atlast to give way. Alberoni was dismissed; and the Spanish forces werewithdrawn from Sardinia and Sicily. The last of these islands now passedto the Emperor, Savoy being compensated for its loss by the acquisitionof Sardinia, from which its Duke took the title of King; while the workof the Treaty of Utrecht was completed by the Emperor's renunciation ofhis claims on the crown of Spain, and Philip's renunciation of hisclaims on the Milanese and the Two Sicilies.[Sidenote: Resignation of Townshend.]Successful as the Ministry had been in its work of peace, the strugglehad disclosed the difficulties which the double position of its newsovereign was to bring upon England. George was not only King ofEngland; he was Elector of Hanover; and in his own mind he cared farmore for the interests of his Electorate than for the interests of hiskingdom. His first aim was to use the power of his new monarchy tostrengthen his position in North Germany. At this moment that positionwas mainly threatened by the hostility of the king of Sweden. Denmarkhad taken advantage of the defeat and absence of Charles the Twelfth toannex Bremen and Verden with Schleswig and Holstein to its dominions;but in its dread of the Swedish king's return it secured the help ofHanover by ceding the first two towns to the Electorate on a promise ofalliance in the war against him. The despatch of a British fleet intothe Baltic with the purpose of overawing Sweden identified England withthe policy of Hanover; and Charles, who from the moment of his returnbent his whole energies to regain what he had lost, retorted by joiningin the schemes of Alberoni, and by concluding an alliance with theRussian Czar, Peter the Great, who for other reasons was hostile to thecourt of Hanover, for a restoration of the Stuarts. Luckily for the newdynasty his plans were brought to an end at the close of 1718 by hisdeath at the siege of Frederickshall; but the policy which provoked themhad already brought about the dissolution of the Whig Ministry. WhenGeorge pressed on his cabinet a treaty of alliance by which Englandshielded Hanover and its acquisitions from any efforts of the SwedishKing, Townshend and Walpole gave a reluctant assent to a measure whichthey regarded as sacrificing English interests to that of theElectorate, and as entangling the country yet more in the affairs of theContinent. For the moment indeed they yielded to the fact that Bremenand Verden were not only of the highest importance to Hanover, which wasbrought by them in contact with the sea, but of hardly less value toEngland itself, as they placed the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser, thechief inlets for British commerce into Germany, in the hands of afriendly state. But they refused to take any further steps in carryingout a Hanoverian policy; and they successfully withstood an attempt ofthe king to involve England in a war with the Czar, when Russian troopsentered Mecklenburg. The resentment of George the First was seconded byintrigues among their fellow-ministers; and in 1717 Townshend andWalpole were forced to resign their posts.[Sidenote: The Stanhope Ministry.]The want of their good sense soon made itself felt. In the reconstitutedcabinet Lords Sunderland and Stanhope remained supreme; and their firstaim was to secure the maintenance of the Whig power by a constitutionalchange. Firm as was the hold of the Whigs over the Commons, it might beshaken by a revulsion of popular feeling, it might be ruined, as it wasdestined to be ruined afterwards, by a change in the temper of the king.Sunderland sought a permanence of public policy which neither popularnor royal government could give in the changelessness of a fixedaristocracy with its centre in the Lords. Harley's creation of twelvepeers to ensure the sanction of the Lords to the Treaty of Utrechtshowed that the Crown possessed a power of swamping the majority andchanging the balance of opinion in the House of Peers. In 1720 thereforethe Ministry introduced a bill, suggested as was believed by LordSunderland, which professed to secure the liberty of the Upper House bylimiting the power of the Crown in the creation of fresh Peers. Thenumber of Peers was permanently fixed at the number then sitting in theHouse; and creations could only be made when vacancies occurred.Twenty-five hereditary Scotch Peers were substituted for the sixteenelected Peers for Scotland. The bill however was strenuously opposed byRobert Walpole. Not only was it a measure which broke the politicalquiet which he looked on as a necessity for the new government, but itjarred on his good sense as a statesman. It would in fact have renderedrepresentative government impossible. For representative government wasnow coming day by day more completely to mean government by the will ofthe House of Commons, carried out by a Ministry which served as themouthpiece of that will. But it was only through the prerogative of theCrown, as exercised under the advice of such a Ministry, that the Peerscould be forced to bow to the will of the Lower House in matters wheretheir opinion was adverse to that of the Commons; and the proposal ofSunderland would have brought legislation and government to a dead lock.[Sidenote: South Sea Bubble.]It was to Walpole's opposition that the Peerage Bill owed its defeat;and this success forced his rivals again to admit him, with Townshend,to a share in the Ministry, though they occupied subordinate offices.But this arrangement was soon to yield to a more natural one. The suddenincrease of English commerce begot at this moment the mania ofspeculation. Ever since the age of Elizabeth the unknown wealth ofSpanish America had acted like a spell upon the imagination ofEnglishmen, and Harley gave countenance to a South Sea Company, whichpromised a reduction of the public debt as the price of a monopoly ofthe Spanish trade. Spain however clung jealously to her old prohibitionsof all foreign commerce; and the Treaty of Utrecht only won for Englandthe right of engaging in the negro slave-trade with its dominions and ofdespatching a single ship to the coast of Spanish America. But in spiteof all this, the Company again came forward, offering in exchange fornew privileges to pay off national burdens which amounted to nearly amillion a year. It was in vain that Walpole warned the Ministry and thecountry against this "dream." Both went mad; and in 1720 bubble Companyfollowed bubble Company, till the inevitable reaction brought a generalruin in its train. The crash brought Stanhope to the grave. Of hiscolleagues, many were found to have received bribes from the South SeaCompany to back its frauds. Craggs, the Secretary of State, died ofterror at the investigation; Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,was sent to the Tower; and in the general wreck of his rivals RobertWalpole mounted again into power. In 1721 he became First Lord of theTreasury, while his brother-in-law, Lord Townshend, returned to hispost of Secretary of State. But their relative position was nowreversed. Townshend had been the head in the earlier administration: inthis Walpole was resolved, to use his own characteristic phrase, that"the firm should be Walpole and Townshend and not Townshend andWalpole."[Sidenote: Walpole's Ministry.]But it was no mere chance or good luck which maintained Walpole at thehead of affairs for more than twenty years. If no Minister has faredworse at the hand of poets or historians, there are few whose greatnesshas been more impartially recognized by practical statesmen. Hisqualities indeed were such as a practical statesman can alone do fulljustice to. There is nothing to charm in the outer aspect of the man;nor is there anything picturesque in the work which he set himself todo, or in the means by which he succeeded in doing it. But picturesqueor no, the work of keeping England quiet, and of giving quiet to Europe,was in itself a noble one; and it is the temper with which he carried onthis work, the sagacity with which he discerned the means by which aloneit could be done, and the stubborn, indomitable will with which he facedevery difficulty in the doing it, which gives Walpole his place amongEnglish statesmen. He was the first and he was the most successful ofour Peace Ministers. "The most pernicious circumstances," he said, "inwhich this country can be are those of war; as we must be losers whileit lasts, and cannot be great gainers when it ends." It was not that thehonour or influence of England suffered in Walpole's hands, for he wonvictories by the firmness of his policy and the skill of hisnegotiations as effectual as any that are won by arms. But up to thevery end of his Ministry, when the frenzy of the nation at last forcedhis hand, in spite of every varying complication of foreign affairs, anda never-ceasing pressure alike from the Opposition and the Court, it isthe glory of Walpole that he resolutely kept England at peace. And as hewas the first of our Peace Ministers, so he was the first of ourFinanciers. He was far indeed from discerning the powers which laterstatesmen have shown to exist in a sound finance, powers of producingboth national developement and international amity; but he had the senseto see, what no minister till then had seen, that the only help astatesman can give to industry or commerce is to remove all obstacles inthe way of their natural growth, and that beyond this the best course hecan take in presence of a great increase in national energy and nationalwealth is to look quietly on and to let it alone. At the outset of hisrule he declared in a speech from the Throne that nothing would moreconduce to the extension of commerce "than to make the exportation ofour own manufactures, and the importation of the commodities used in themanufacturing of them, as practicable and easy as may be."[Sidenote: Walpole's finance.]The first act of his financial administration was to take off the dutiesfrom more than a hundred British exports, and nearly forty articles ofimportation. In 1730 he broke in the same enlightened spirit through theprejudice which restricted the commerce of the Colonies to the mothercountry alone, by allowing Georgia and the Carolinas to export theirrice directly to any part of Europe. The result was that the rice ofAmerica soon drove that of Italy and Egypt from the market. His ExciseBill, defective as it was, was the first measure in which an EnglishMinister showed any real grasp of the principles of taxation. The wisdomof Walpole was rewarded by a quick upgrowth of prosperity. The materialprogress of the country was such as England had never seen before. Ourexports, which were only six millions in value at the beginning of thecentury, had reached the value of twelve millions by the middle of it.It was above all the trade with the Colonies which began to give Englanda new wealth. The whole Colonial trade at the time of the battle ofBlenheim was no greater than the trade with the single isle of Jamaicaat the opening of the American war. At the accession of George theSecond the exports to Pennsylvania were valued at L15,000. At his deaththey reached half-a-million. In the middle of the eighteenth centurythe profits of Great Britain from the trade with the Colonies wereestimated at two millions a year. And with the growth of wealth came aquick growth in population. That of Manchester and Birmingham, whosemanufactures were now becoming of importance, doubled in thirty years.Bristol, the chief seat of the West Indian trade, rose into newprosperity. Liverpool, which owes its creation to the new trade with theWest, sprang up from a little country town into the third port in thekingdom. With peace and security, and the wealth that they brought withthem, the value of land, and with it the rental of every countrygentleman, rose fast. "Estates which were rented at two thousand a yearthreescore years ago," said Burke in 1766, "are at three thousand atpresent."[Sidenote: His policy of inaction.]Nothing shows more clearly the soundness of his political intellect thanthe fact that this upgrowth of wealth around him never made Walpoleswerve from a rigid economy, from a steady reduction of the debt, or adiminution of fiscal duties. Even before the death of George the Firstthe public burdens were reduced by twenty millions. It was indeed ineconomy alone that his best work could be done. In finance as in otherfields of statesmanship Walpole was forbidden from taking more thantentative steps towards a wiser system by the needs of the work he hadspecially to do. To this work everything gave way. He withdrew hisExcise Bill rather than suffer the agitation it roused to break thequiet which was reconciling the country to the system of the Revolution.His hatred of religious intolerance or the support he hoped for from theDissenters never swayed him to rouse the spirit of popular bigotry,which he knew to be ready to burst out at the slightest challenge, byany effort to repeal the laws against Nonconformity. His temper wasnaturally vigorous and active; and yet the years of his power are yearswithout parallel in our annals for political stagnation. His longadministration indeed is almost without a history. All legislative andpolitical action seemed to cease with his entry into office. Year afteryear passed by without a change. In the third year of Walpole's ministrythere was but one division in the House of Commons. Such an inactiongives little scope for the historian; but it fell in with the temper ofthe nation at large. It was popular with the class which commonlypresses for political activity. The energy of the trading class wasabsorbed for the time in the rapid extension of commerce andaccumulation of wealth. So long as the country was justly andtemperately governed the merchant and shopkeeper were content to leavegovernment in the hands that held it. All they asked was to be let aloneto enjoy their new freedom and develope their new industries. AndWalpole let them alone. On the other hand, the forces which opposed theRevolution lost year by year somewhat of their energy. The fervourwhich breeds revolt died down among the Jacobites as their swords rustedidly in their scabbards. The Tories sulked in their country houses; buttheir wrath against the House of Hanover ebbed away for want ofopportunities of exerting itself. And meanwhile on opponents as onfriends the freedom which the Revolution had brought with it was doingits work. It was to the patient influence of this freedom that Walpoletrusted; and it was the special mark of his administration that in spiteof every temptation he gave it full play. Though he dared not touch thelaws that oppressed the Catholic or the Dissenter, he took care thatthey should remain inoperative. Catholic worship went on unhindered.Yearly bills of indemnity exempted the Nonconformists from theconsequences of their infringement of the Test Act. There was notampering with public justice or with personal liberty. Thought andaction were alike left free. No Minister was ever more foully slanderedby journalists and pamphleteers; but Walpole never meddled with thepress.[Sidenote: Fresh efforts of Spain.]Abroad as well as at home the difficulties in the way of his policy wereenormous. Peace was still hard to maintain. Defeated as her firstattempt had been, Spain remained resolute to regain her lost provinces,to recover Gibraltar and Minorca, and to restore her old monopoly oftrade with her American colonies. She had learned that she could dothis only by breaking the alliance of the Four Powers, which left herisolated in Europe; and she saw at last a chance of breaking this leaguein the difficulties of the House of Austria. The Emperor Charles theSixth was without a son. He had issued a Pragmatic Sanction by which heprovided that his hereditary dominions should descend unbroken to hisdaughter, Maria Theresa, but no European state had as yet consented toguarantee her succession. Spain seized on this opportunity of detachingthe Emperor from the Western powers. She promised to support thePragmatic Sanction in return for a pledge on the part of Charles to aidin wresting Gibraltar and Minorca from England, and in securing to aSpanish prince the succession to Parma, Piacenza, and Tuscany. A grantof the highest trading privileges in her American dominions to acommercial company which the Emperor had established at Ostend, indefiance of the Treaty of Westphalia and the remonstrances of Englandand Holland, revealed this secret alliance; and there were fears of theadhesion of Russia, which still remained hostile to England through thequarrel with Hanover. The danger was met for a while by an alliance ofEngland, France, and Prussia, in 1725; but the withdrawal of the lastPower again gave courage to the confederates, and in 1727 the Spaniardsbesieged Gibraltar while Charles threatened an invasion of Holland. Themoderation of Walpole alone averted a European war. While sendingBritish squadrons to the Baltic, the Spanish coast, and America, hesucceeded by diplomatic pressure in again forcing the Emperor toinaction; after weary negotiations Spain was brought in 1729 to sign theTreaty of Seville and to content herself with the promise of asuccession of a Spanish prince to the Duchies of Parma and Tuscany; andthe discontent of Charles the Sixth at this concession was allayed in1731 by giving the guarantee of England to the Pragmatic Sanction.[Sidenote: George the Second.]The patience and even temper which Walpole showed in this business werethe more remarkable that in the course of it his power received whatseemed a fatal shock from the death of the king. George the First diedon a journey to Hanover in 1727; and his successor, George the Second,was known to have hated his father's Minister hardly less than he hadhated his father. But hate Walpole as he might, the new king wasabsolutely guided by the adroitness of his wife, Caroline of Anspach;and Caroline had resolved that there should be no change in theMinistry. After a few days of withdrawal therefore Walpole againreturned to office; and the years which followed were those in which hispower reached its height. He gained as great an influence over Georgethe Second as he had gained over his father: and in spite of the steadyincrease of his opponents in the House of Commons, his hold over itremained unshaken. The country was tranquil and prosperous. Theprejudices of the landed gentry were met by a steady effort to reducethe land-tax, whose pressure was half the secret of their hostility tothe Revolution that produced it. The Church was quiet. The Jacobiteswere too hopeless to stir. A few trade measures and social reforms creptquietly through the Houses. An inquiry into the state of the gaolsshowed that social thought was not utterly dead. A bill of great valueenacted that all proceedings in courts of justice should henceforth bein the English tongue.[Sidenote: Excise Bill.]Only once did Walpole break this tranquillity by an attempt at a greatmeasure of statesmanship; and the result of his attempt proved how wisewas the inactivity of his general policy. No tax had from the firstmoment of its introduction been more unpopular than the Excise. Itsorigin was due to Pym and the Long Parliament, who imposed duties onbeer, cyder, and perry, which at the Restoration produced an annualincome of more than six hundred thousand pounds. The war with France atthe Revolution brought with it the imposition of a malt-tax andadditional duties on spirits, wine, tobacco, and other articles. Sogreat had been the increase in the public wealth that the return fromthe Excise amounted at the death of George the First to nearly twomillions and a half a year. But its unpopularity remained unabated, andeven philosophers like Locke contended that the whole public revenueshould be drawn from direct taxes upon the land. Walpole, on the otherhand, saw in the growth of indirect taxation a means of winning over thecountry gentry to the new dynasty of the Revolution by freeing the landfrom all burdens whatever. He saw too a means of diminishing the losssuffered by the revenue from the Customs through smuggling and fraud.These losses were immense; that on tobacco alone amounted to a third ofthe whole duty. In 1733 therefore he introduced an Excise Bill, whichmet this evil by the establishment of bonded warehouses, and by thecollection of the duties from the inland dealers in the form of Exciseand not of Customs. The first measure would have made London a freeport, and doubled English trade. The second would have so largelyincreased the revenue, without any loss to the consumer, as to enableWalpole to repeal the land-tax. In the case of tea and coffee alone, thechange in the mode of levying the duty was estimated to bring in anadditional hundred thousand pounds a year. The necessaries of life andthe raw materials of manufacture were in Walpole's plan to remainabsolutely untaxed. The scheme was in effect an anticipation of theprinciples which have guided English finance since the triumph of freetrade, and every part of it has now been carried into effect. But in1733 Walpole stood ahead of his time. The violence of his opponents washacked by an outburst of popular prejudice; riots almost grew intorevolt; and in spite of the Queen's wish to put down resistance byforce, Walpole withdrew the bill. "I will not be the Minister," he saidwith noble self-command, "to enforce taxes at the expense of blood."[Sidenote: The Patriots.]What had fanned popular prejudice into a flame during the uproar overthe Excise Bill was the violence of the so-called "Patriots." In theabsence of a strong opposition and of great impulses to enthusiasm aparty breaks readily into factions; and the weakness of the Toriesjoined with the stagnation of public affairs to breed faction among theWhigs. Walpole too was jealous of power; and as his jealousy drovecolleague after colleague out of office they became leaders of a partywhose sole aim was to thrust him from his post. Greed of power indeedwas the one passion which mastered his robust common sense. Townshendwas turned out of office in 1730, Lord Chesterfield in 1733; and thoughhe started with the ablest administration the country had known, Walpolewas left after twenty years of supremacy with but one man of ability inhis cabinet, the Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke. With the single exceptionof Townshend, the colleagues whom his jealousy dismissed plunged into anopposition more factious and unprincipled than has ever disgracedEnglish politics. The "Patriots," as they called themselves, ownedPulteney, a brilliant speaker and unscrupulous intriguer, as their head;they were reinforced by a band of younger Whigs--the "Boys," as Walpolenamed them--whose temper revolted alike against the inaction andcynicism of his policy, and whose fiery spokesman was a young cornet ofhorse, William Pitt; and they rallied to these the fragment of the Toryparty which still took part in politics, a fragment inconsiderable innumbers but of far greater weight as representing a large part of thenation, and which was guided for a while by the virulent ability ofBolingbroke, whom Walpole had suffered to return from exile, but to whomhe had refused the restoration of his seat in the House of Lords. InsideParliament indeed the invectives of the "Patriots" fell dead beforeWalpole's majorities and his good-humoured contempt; so far were theirattacks from shaking his power that Bolingbroke abandoned the strugglein despair to return again into exile, while Pulteney with his partycould only take refuge in a silly secession from Parliament. But on thenation at large their speeches and pamphlets, with the brilliantsarcasms of their literary allies, such as Pope or Johnson, did moreeffective work. Unjust indeed as their outcry was, the growing responseto it told that the political inactivity of the country was drawing toan end. It was the very success of Walpole's policy which was to bringabout his downfall; for it was the gradual closing of the chasm whichhad all but broken England into two warring peoples that allowed thepolitical energy of the country to return to its natural channels and togive a new vehemence to political strife. Vague too and hollow as muchof the "high talk" of the Patriots was, it showed that the age ofpolitical cynicism, of that unbelief in high sentiment and nobleaspirations which had followed on the crash of Puritanism, was drawingto an end. Rant about ministerial corruption would have fallen flat onthe public ear had not new moral forces, a new sense of social virtue, anew sense of religion been stirring, however blindly, in the minds ofEnglishmen.[Sidenote: The Methodists.]The stir showed itself markedly in a religious revival which dates fromthe later years of Walpole's ministry; and which began in a small knotof Oxford students, whose revolt against the religious deadness of theirtimes expressed itself in ascetic observances, an enthusiastic devotion,and a methodical regularity of life which gained them the nickname of"Methodists." Three figures detached themselves from the group as soonas, on its transfer to London in 1738, it attracted public attention bythe fervour and even extravagance of its piety; and each found hisspecial work in the task to which the instinct of the new movement ledit from the first, that of carrying religion and morality to the vastmasses of population which lay concentrated in the towns or around themines and collieries of Cornwall and the north. Whitefield, a servitorof Pembroke College, was above all the preacher of the revival. Speechwas governing English politics; and the religious power of speech wasshown when a dread of "enthusiasm" closed against the new apostles thepulpits of the Established Church, and forced them to preach in thefields. Their voice was soon heard in the wildest and most barbarouscorners of the land, among the bleak moors of Northumberland, or in thedens of London, or in the long galleries where in the pauses of hislabour the Cornish miner listens to the sobbing of the sea. Whitefield'spreaching was such as England had never heard before, theatrical,extravagant, often commonplace, but hushing all criticism by its intensereality, its earnestness of belief, its deep tremulous sympathy with thesin and sorrow of mankind. It was no common enthusiast who could wringgold from the close-fisted Franklin and admiration from the fastidiousHorace Walpole, or who could look down from the top of a green knoll atKingswood on twenty thousand colliers, grimy from the Bristol coal-pits,and see as he preached the tears "making white channels down theirblackened cheeks."[Sidenote: The religious revival.]On the rough and ignorant masses to whom they spoke the effect ofWhitefield and his fellow Methodists was mighty both for good and ill.Their preaching stirred a passionate hatred in their opponents. Theirlives were often in danger, they were mobbed, they were ducked, theywere stoned, they were smothered with filth. But the enthusiasm theyaroused was equally passionate. Women fell down in convulsions; strongmen were smitten suddenly to the earth; the preacher was interrupted bybursts of hysteric laughter or of hysteric sobbing. All the phenomena ofstrong spiritual excitement, so familiar now, but at that time strangeand unknown, followed on their sermons; and the terrible sense of aconviction of sin, a new dread of hell, a new hope of heaven, took formsat once grotesque and sublime. Charles Wesley, a Christ Church student,came to add sweetness to this sudden and startling light. He was the"sweet singer" of the movement. His hymns expressed the fiery convictionof its converts in lines so chaste and beautiful that its moreextravagant features disappeared. The wild throes of hysteric enthusiasmpassed into a passion for hymn-singing, and a new musical impulse wasaroused in the people which gradually changed the face of publicdevotion throughout England.[Sidenote: John Wesley.]But it was his elder brother, John Wesley, who embodied in himself notthis or that side of the new movement, but the movement itself. Even atOxford, where he resided as a fellow of Lincoln, he had been looked uponas head of the group of Methodists, and after his return from a quixoticmission to the Indians of Georgia he again took the lead of the littlesociety, which had removed in the interval to London. In power as apreacher he stood next to Whitefield; as a hymn-writer he stood secondto his brother Charles. But while combining in some degree theexcellences of either, he possessed qualities in which both were utterlydeficient; an indefatigable industry, a cool judgement, a command overothers, a faculty of organization, a singular union of patience andmoderation with an imperious ambition, which marked him as a ruler ofmen. He had besides a learning and skill in writing which no other ofthe Methodists possessed; he was older than any of his colleagues at thestart of the movement, and he outlived them all. His life indeed almostcovers the century. He was born in 1703 and lived on till 1791, and theMethodist body had passed through every phase of its history before hesank into the grave at the age of eighty-eight. It would have beenimpossible for Wesley to have wielded the power he did had he not sharedthe follies and extravagance as well as the enthusiasm of his disciples.Throughout his life his asceticism was that of a monk. At times he livedon bread only, and he often slept on the bare boards. He lived in aworld of wonders and divine interpositions. It was a miracle if the rainstopped and allowed him to set forward on a journey. It was a judgementof heaven if a hailstorm burst over a town which had been deaf to hispreaching. One day, he tells us, when he was tired and his horse felllame, "I thought cannot God heal either man or beast by any means orwithout any?--immediately my headache ceased and my horse's lameness inthe same instant." With a still more childish fanaticism he guided hisconduct, whether in ordinary events or in the great crises of his life,by drawing lots or watching the particular texts at which his Bibleopened.[Sidenote: His organization of Methodism.]But with all this extravagance and superstition Wesley's mind wasessentially practical, orderly, and conservative. No man ever stood atthe head of a great revolution whose temper was so anti-revolutionary.In his earlier days the bishops had been forced to rebuke him for thenarrowness and intolerance of his churchmanship. When Whitefield beganhis sermons in the fields, Wesley "could not at first reconcile himselfto that strange way." He condemned and fought against the admission oflaymen as preachers till he found himself left with none but laymen topreach. To the last he clung passionately to the Church of England, andlooked on the body he had formed as but a lay society in full communionwith it. He broke with the Moravians, who had been the earliest friendsof the new movement, when they endangered its safe conduct by theircontempt of religious forms. He broke with Whitefield when the greatpreacher plunged into an extravagant Calvinism. But the same practicaltemper of mind which led him to reject what was unmeasured, and to bethe last to adopt what was new, enabled him at once to grasp andorganize the novelties he adopted. He became himself the most unweariedof field preachers, and his journal for half-a-century is little morethan a record of fresh journeys and fresh sermons. When once driven toemploy lay helpers in his ministry he made their work a new andattractive feature in his system. His earlier asceticism only lingeredin a dread of social enjoyments and an aversion from the gayer andsunnier side of life which links the Methodist movement with that of thePuritans. As the fervour of his superstition died down into the calm ofage, his cool common sense discouraged in his followers the enthusiasticoutbursts which marked the opening of the revival. His powers were bentto the building up of a great religious society which might give to thenew enthusiasm a lasting and practical form. The Methodists were groupedinto classes, gathered in love-feasts, purified by the expulsion ofunworthy members, and furnished with an alternation of settled ministersand wandering preachers; while the whole body was placed under theabsolute government of a Conference of ministers. But so long as helived, the direction of the new religious society remained with Wesleyalone. "If by arbitrary power," he replied with charming simplicity toobjectors, "you mean a power which I exercise simply without anycolleagues therein, this is certainly true, but I see no hurt in it."[Sidenote: Results of the movement.]The great body which he thus founded numbered a hundred thousand membersat his death, and now counts its members in England and America bymillions. But the Methodists themselves were the least result of theMethodist revival. Its action upon the Church, as we shall see later,broke the lethargy of the clergy who, under the influence of the"Evangelical" movement, were called to a loftier conception of theirduties; while a powerful moral enthusiasm appeared in the nation atlarge. A new philanthropy reformed our prisons, infused clemency andwisdom into our penal laws, abolished the slave-trade, and gave thefirst impulse to popular education.[Sidenote: Revival of France.]From the new England which was springing up about him, from that newstir of national life and emotion of which the Wesleyan revival was buta part, Walpole stood utterly aloof. National enthusiasm, nationalpassion, found no echo in his cool and passionless good sense. Thegrowing consciousness in the people at large of a new greatness, itsinstinctive prevision of the coming of a time when England was to play aforemost part in the history of the world, the upgrowth of a nobler andloftier temper which should correspond to such a destiny, all were alikeunintelligible to him. In the talk of patriotism and public virtue hesaw mere rant and extravagance. "Men would grow wiser," he said, "andcome out of that." The revival of English religion he looked on with anindifference lightly dashed with dread as a reawakening of fanaticismwhich might throw new obstacles in the way of religious liberty. In theface of the growing excitement therefore he clung as doggedly as ever tohis policy of quiet at home and peace abroad. But peace was nowthreatened by a foe far more formidable than Spain. What had hithertoenabled England to uphold the settlement of Europe as established at thePeace of Utrecht was above all the alliance and backing of France. Butit was clear that such an alliance could hardly be a permanent one. TheTreaty of Utrecht had been a humiliation for France even more than forSpain. It had marked the failure of those dreams of European supremacywhich the House of Bourbon had nursed ever since the close of thesixteenth century, and which Lewis the Fourteenth had all but turnedfrom dreams into realities. Beaten and impoverished, France had bowed tothe need of peace; but her strange powers of recovery had shownthemselves in the years of tranquillity that peace secured; and withreviving wealth and the upgrowth of a new generation which had knownnothing of the woes that followed Blenheim and Ramillies the oldambition started again into life.[Sidenote: Its union with Spain.]It was fired to action by a new rivalry. The naval supremacy of Britainwas growing into an empire of the sea; and not only was such an empirein itself a challenge to France, but it was fatal to the aspirationsafter a colonial dominion, after aggrandizement in America, and theupbuilding of a French power in the East, which were already vaguelystirring in the breasts of her statesmen. And to this new rivalry wasadded the temptation of a new chance of success. On the Continent themightiest foe of France had ever been the House of Austria; but thatHouse was now paralyzed by a question of succession. It was almostcertain that the quarrels which must follow the death of the Emperorwould break the strength of Germany, and it was probable that they mightbe so managed as to destroy for ever that of the House of Hapsburg.While the main obstacle to her ambition was thus weakened or removed,France won a new and invaluable aid to it in the friendship of Spain.Accident had hindered for a while the realization of the forebodingswhich led Marlborough and Somers so fiercely to oppose a recognition ofthe union of the two countries under the same royal house in the Peaceof Utrecht. The age and death of Lewis the Fourteenth, the minority ofhis successor, the hostility between Philip of Spain and the Duke ofOrleans, the personal quarrel between the two Crowns which broke outafter the Duke's death, had long held the Bourbon powers apart. Francehad in fact been thrown on the alliance of England, and had been forcedto play a chief part in opposing Spain and in maintaining the Europeansettlement. But at the death of George the First this temporaryseverance was already passing away. The birth of children to Lewis theFifteenth settled all questions of succession; and no obstacle remainedto hinder their family sympathies from uniting the Bourbon Courts in acommon action. The boast of Lewis the Fourteenth was at last fulfilled.In the mighty struggle for supremacy which France carried on from thefall of Walpole to the Peace of Paris her strength was doubled by thefact that there were "no Pyrenees."[Sidenote: The Family Compact.]The first signs of this new danger showed themselves in 1733, when thepeace of Europe was broken afresh by disputes which rose out of acontested election to the throne of Poland. Austria and France werealike drawn into the strife; and in England the awakening jealousy ofFrench designs roused a new pressure for war. The new king too was eagerto fight, and her German sympathies inclined even Caroline to join inthe fray. But Walpole stood firm for the observance of neutrality. Heworked hard to avert and to narrow the war; but he denied that Britishinterests were so involved in it as to call on England to take a part."There are fifty thousand men slain this year in Europe," he boasted asthe strife went on, "and not one Englishman." Meanwhile he laboured tobring the quarrel to a close; and in 1736 the intervention of Englandand Holland succeeded in restoring peace. But the country had watchedwith a jealous dread the military energy that proclaimed the revival ofthe French arms; and it noted bitterly that peace was bought by thetriumph of both branches of the House of Bourbon. A new Bourbon monarchywas established at the cost of the House of Austria by the cession ofthe Two Sicilies to a Spanish Prince in exchange for his right ofsuccession to the Duchies of Parma and Tuscany. On the other hand,Lorraine, so long coveted by French ambition, passed finally into thehands of France. The political instinct of the nation at once discernedin these provisions a union of the Bourbon powers; and its dread of sucha union proved to be a just one. As early as the outbreak of the war aFamily Compact had been secretly concluded between France and Spain, themain object of which was the ruin of the maritime supremacy of Britain.Spain bound herself to deprive England gradually of its commercialprivileges in her American dominions, and to transfer them to France.France in return engaged to support Spain at sea, and to aid her in therecovery of Gibraltar.[Sidenote: England and Spain.]The caution with which Walpole held aloof from the Polish war renderedthis compact inoperative for the time; but neither of the Bourboncourts ceased to look forward to its future execution. The peace of1736 was indeed a mere pause in the struggle which their union madeinevitable. No sooner was the war ended than France strained every nerveto increase her fleet; while Spain steadily tightened the restrictionson British commerce with her American colonies. It was the dim, feverishsense of the drift of these efforts that embittered every hour thestruggle of English traders with the Spaniards in the southern seas. Thetrade with Spanish America, which, illegal as it was, had grown largelythrough the connivance of Spanish port-officers during the long allianceof England and Spain in the wars against France, had at last received alegal recognition in the Peace of Utrecht. But it was left under narrowrestrictions; and Spain had never abandoned the dream of restoring itsold monopoly. Her efforts however to restore it had as yet been baffled;while the restrictions were evaded by a vast system of smuggling whichrendered what remained of the Spanish monopoly all but valueless. Philiphowever persisted in his efforts to bring down English intercourse withhis colonies to the importation of negroes and the despatch of a singlemerchant vessel, as stipulated by the Treaty of Utrecht; and from themoment of the compact with France the restrictions were enforced with afresh rigour. Collisions took place which made it hard to keep thepeace; and in 1738 the ill humour of the trading classes was driven tomadness by the appearance of a merchant captain named Jenkins at the barof the House of Commons. He told the tale of his torture by theSpaniards, and produced an ear which, he said, they had cut off amidsttaunts at England and its king. It was in vain that Walpole strove to dojustice to both parties, and that he battled stubbornly against the cryfor a war which he knew to be an unjust one, and to be as impolitic asit was unjust. He saw that the House of Bourbon was only waiting for theEmperor's death to deal its blow at the House of Austria; and theEmperor's death was now close at hand. At such a juncture it was of thehighest importance that England should be free to avail herself of everymeans to guard the European settlement, and that she should not tie herhands by a contest which would divert her attention from the greatcrisis which was impending, as well as drain the forces which would haveenabled Walpole to deal with it.[Sidenote: War with Spain.]But his efforts were in vain. His negotiations were foiled by the frenzyof the one country and the pride of the other. At home his enemiesassailed him with a storm of abuse. Pope and Johnson alike lent theirpens to lampoon the minister. Ballad-singers trolled out their rimes tothe crowd on "the cur-dog of Britain and spaniel of Spain." His positionhad been weakened by the death of the queen; and it was now weakenedyet more by the open hostility of the Prince of Wales, who in his hatredof his father had come to hate his father's ministers as heartily asGeorge the Second had hated those of George the First. His mastery ofthe House of Commons too was no longer unquestioned. The Tories wereslowly returning to Parliament, and their numbers had now mounted to ahundred and ten. The numbers and the violence of the "Patriots" hadgrown with the open patronage of Prince Frederick. The country wasslowly turning against him. The counties now sent not a member to hissupport. Walpole's majority was drawn from the boroughs; it restedtherefore on management, on corruption, and on the support of thetrading classes. But with the cry for a commercial war the support ofthe trading class failed him. Even in his own cabinet, though he haddriven from it every man of independence, he was pressed at thisjuncture to yield by the Duke of Newcastle and his brother Henry Pelham,who were fast acquiring political importance from their wealth, and fromtheir prodigal devotion of it to the purchase of parliamentary support.But it was not till he stood utterly alone that Walpole gave way, andthat he consented in 1739 to a war against Spain.[Sidenote: The Austrian Succession.]"They may ring their bells now," the great minister said bitterly, aspeals and bonfires welcomed his surrender; "but they will soon bewringing their hands." His foresight was at once justified. No soonerhad Admiral Vernon appeared off the coast of South America with anEnglish fleet, and captured Porto Bello, than France gave an indicationof her purpose to act on the secret compact by a formal declaration thatshe would not consent to any English settlement on the mainland of SouthAmerica, and by despatching two squadrons to the West Indies. But it wasplain that the union of the Bourbon courts had larger aims than theprotection of Spanish America. The Emperor was dying; and pledged asFrance was to the Pragmatic Sanction few believed she would redeem herpledge. It had been given indeed with reluctance; even the peace-lovingFleury had said that France ought to have lost three battles before sheconfirmed it. And now that the opportunity had at last come forfinishing the work which Henry the Second had begun, of breaking up theEmpire into a group of powers too weak to resist French aggression, itwas idle to expect her to pass it by. If once the hereditary dominionsof the House of Austria were parted amongst various claimants, if thedignity of the Emperor was no longer supported by the mass of dominionwhich belonged personally to the Hapsburgs, France would be left withouta rival on the Continent. Walpole at once turned to face this revival ofa danger which the Grand Alliance had defeated. Not only the House ofAustria but Russia too was called on to join in a league against theBourbons; and Prussia, the German power to which Walpole had leant fromthe beginning, was counted on to give an aid as firm as Brandenburg hadgiven in the older struggle. But the project remained a mere plan whenin October 1740 the death of Charles the Sixth forced on the Europeanstruggle.[Sidenote: Fall of Walpole.]The plan of the English Cabinet at once broke down. The new King ofPrussia, Frederick the Second, whom English opinion had hailed asdestined to play the part in the new league which his ancestor hadplayed in the old, suddenly showed himself the most vigorous assailantof the House of Hapsburg; and while Frederick claimed Silesia, Bavariaclaimed the Austrian Duchies, which passed with the other hereditarydominions according to the Pragmatic Sanction to Maria Theresa, or, asshe was now called, the Queen of Hungary. The hour was come for theBourbon courts to act. In union with Spain, which aimed at theannexation of the Milanese, France promised her aid to Prussia andBavaria; while Sweden and Sardinia allied themselves to France. In thesummer of 1741 two French armies entered Germany, and the Elector ofBavaria appeared unopposed before Vienna. Never had the House of Austriastood in such peril. Its opponents counted on a division of itsdominions. France claimed the Netherlands, Spain the Milanese, Bavariathe kingdom of Bohemia, Frederick the Second Silesia. Hungary and theDuchy of Austria alone were left to Maria Theresa. Walpole, though stilltrue to her cause, advised her to purchase Frederick's aid againstFrance and her allies by the cession of part of Silesia. The counsel waswise, for Frederick in hope of some such turn of events had as yet heldaloof from actual alliance with France, but the Patriots spurred theQueen to refusal by promising her England's aid in the recovery of herfull inheritance. Walpole's last hope of rescuing Austria was broken bythis resolve; and Frederick was driven to conclude the alliance withFrance from which he had so stubbornly held aloof. But the Queen refusedto despair. She won the support of Hungary by restoring itsconstitutional rights; and British subsidies enabled her to march at thehead of a Hungarian army to the rescue of Vienna, to overrun Bavaria,and repulse an attack of Frederick on Moravia in the spring of 1742. OnEngland's part, however, the war was waged feebly and ineffectively.Admiral Vernon was beaten before Carthagena; and Walpole was chargedwith thwarting and starving his operations. With the same injustice, theselfishness with which George the Second hurried to Hanover, and in hisdread of harm to his hereditary state averted the entry of a Frencharmy by binding himself as Elector to neutrality in the war, though thestep had been taken without Walpole's knowledge, was laid to theminister's charge. His power indeed was ebbing every day. He stillrepelled the attacks of the "Patriots" with wonderful spirit; but in anew Parliament which was called at this crisis his majority dropped tosixteen, and in his own Cabinet he became almost powerless. The buoyanttemper which had carried him through so many storms broke down at last."He who was asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow," writes hisson, "now never sleeps above an hour without waking: and he who atdinner always forgot his own anxieties, and was more gay and thoughtlessthan all the company, now sits without speaking and with his eyes fixedfor an hour together." The end was in fact near; and in the opening of1742 the dwindling of his majority to three forced Walpole to resign.[Sidenote: Carteret.]His fall however made no change in English policy, at home or abroad.The bulk of his ministry had opposed him in his later years of office,and at his retirement they resumed their posts, simply admitting some ofthe more prominent members of opposition, and giving the control offoreign affairs to Lord Carteret, a man of great power, and skilled incontinental affairs. Carteret mainly followed the system of hispredecessor. It was in the union of Austria and Prussia that he lookedfor the means of destroying the hold France had now established inGermany by the election of her puppet, Charles of Bavaria, as Emperor;and the pressure of England, aided by a victory of Frederick atChotusitz, forced Maria Theresa to consent to Walpole's plan of a peacewith Prussia at Breslau on the terms of the cession of Silesia. Thepeace at once realized Carteret's hopes by enabling the Austrian army todrive the French from Bohemia at the close of 1742, while the newminister threw a new vigour into the warlike efforts of England itself.One English fleet blockaded Cadiz, another anchored in the bay of Naplesand forced Don Carlos by a threat of bombarding his capital to concludea treaty of neutrality, and English subsidies detached Sardinia from theFrench alliance.[Sidenote: Dettingen.]The aim of Carteret and of the Court of Vienna was now not only to setup the Pragmatic Sanction, but to undo the French encroachments of 1736.Naples and Sicily were to be taken back from their Spanish king, Elsassand Lorraine from France; and the imperial dignity was to be restored tothe Austrian House. To carry out these schemes an Austrian army drovethe Emperor from Bavaria in the spring of 1743; while George the Second,who warmly supported Carteret's policy, put himself at the head of aforce of 40,000 men, the bulk of whom were English and Hanoverians, andmarched from the Netherlands to the Main. His advance was checked andfinally turned into a retreat by the Duc de Noailles, who appeared witha superior army on the south bank of the river, and finally throwing31,000 men across it threatened to compel the king to surrender. In thebattle of Dettingen which followed, however, on the 27th June 1743, notonly was the allied army saved from destruction by the impetuosity ofthe French horse and the dogged obstinacy with which the English heldtheir ground, but their opponents were forced to recross the Main. Smallas was the victory, it produced amazing results. The French evacuatedGermany. The English and Austrian armies appeared on the Rhine; and aleague between England, Prussia, and the Queen of Hungary, seemed allthat was needed to secure the results already gained.[Sidenote: Fall of Carteret.]But the prospect of peace was overthrown by the ambition of the house ofAustria. In the spring of 1744 an Austrian army marched upon Naples,with the purpose of transferring it after its conquest to the BavarianEmperor, whose hereditary dominions in Bavaria were to pass in return toMaria Theresa. Its march at once forced the Prussian king into a freshattitude of hostility. If Frederick had withdrawn from the war on thecession of Silesia, he was resolute to take up arms again rather thansuffer so great an aggrandizement of the House of Austria in Germany.His sudden alliance with France failed at first to change the course ofthe war; for though he was successful in seizing Prague and drawing theAustrian army from the Rhine, Frederick was driven from Bohemia, whilethe death of the Emperor forced Bavaria to lay down its arms and to allyitself with Maria Theresa. So high were the Queen's hopes at this momentthat she formed a secret alliance with Russia for the division of thePrussian monarchy. But in 1745 the tide turned, and the fatal results ofCarteret's weakness in assenting to a change in the character of thestruggle which transformed it from a war of defence into one of attackbecame manifest. The young French king, Lewis the Fifteenth, himself ledan army into the Netherlands; and the refusal of Holland to act againsthim left their defence wholly in the hands of England. The general angerat this widening of the war proved fatal to Carteret, or as he nowbecame, Earl Granville. His imperious temper had rendered him odious tohis colleagues, and he was driven from office by the Pelhams, who notonly forced George against his will to dismiss him, but foiled theking's attempt to construct a new administration with Granville at itshead.[Sidenote: The Pelham Ministry.]Of the reconstituted ministry which followed Henry Pelham became thehead. His temper as well as a consciousness of his own mediocritydisposed him to a policy of conciliation which reunited the Whigs.Chesterfield and the Whigs in opposition, with Pitt and "the Boys," allfound room in the new administration; and even a few Tories, who hadgiven help to Pelham's party, found admittance. Their entry was thefirst breach in the system of purely party government established on theaccession of George the First, though it was more than compensated bythe new strength and unity of the Whigs. But the chief significance ofCarteret's fall lay in its bearing on foreign policy. The rivalry ofHanover with Prussia for a headship of North Germany found expression inthe bitter hostility of George the Second to Frederick; and it was inaccord with George that Carteret had lent himself to the vengeance ofAustria on her most dangerous opponent. But the bulk of the Whigsremained true to the policy of Walpole, while the entry of the Patriotsinto the ministry had been on the condition that English interestsshould be preferred to Hanoverian. It was to pave the way to anaccommodation with Frederick and a close of the war that the Pelhamsforced Carteret to resign. But it was long before the new system couldbe brought to play, for the main attention of the new ministry had to begiven to the war in Flanders, where Marshal Saxe had established thesuperiority of the French army by his defeat of the Duke of Cumberland.Advancing to the relief of Tournay with a force of English, Hanoverians,and Dutch--for Holland, however reluctantly, had at last been draggedinto the war, though by English subsidies--the Duke on the 31st of May1745 found the French covered by a line of fortified villages andredoubts with but a single narrow gap near the hamlet of Fontenoy. Intothis gap, however, the English troops, formed in a dense column,doggedly thrust themselves in spite of a terrible fire; but at themoment when the day seemed won the French guns, rapidly concentrated intheir front, tore the column in pieces and drove it back in a slow andorderly retreat. The blow was followed up in June by a victory ofFrederick at Hohenfriedburg which drove the Austrians from Silesia, andby the landing of a Stuart on the coast of Scotland at the close ofJuly.[Sidenote: Charles Edward Stuart.]The war with France had at once revived the hopes of the Jacobites; andas early as 1744 Charles Edward, the grandson of James the Second, wasplaced by the French Government at the head of a formidable armament.But his plan of a descent on Scotland was defeated by a storm whichwrecked his fleet, and by the march of the French troops which hadsailed in it to the war in Flanders. In 1745 however the youngadventurer again embarked with but seven friends in a small vessel andlanded on a little island of the Hebrides. For three weeks he stoodalmost alone; but on the 29th of August the clans rallied to hisstandard in Glenfinnan, and Charles found himself at the head of fifteenhundred men. His force swelled to an army as he marched through BlairAthol on Perth, entered Edinburgh in triumph, and proclaimed "James theEighth" at the Town Cross; and two thousand English troops who marchedagainst him under Sir John Cope were broken and cut to pieces on the21st of September by a single charge of the clansmen at Prestonpans.Victory at once doubled the forces of the conqueror. The Prince was nowat the head of six thousand men; but all were still Highlanders, for thepeople of the Lowlands held aloof from his standard, and it was with theutmost difficulty that he could induce them to follow him to the south.His tact and energy however at last conquered every obstacle, and afterskilfully evading an army gathered at Newcastle he marched throughLancashire, and pushed on the 4th of December as far as Derby. But hereall hope of success came to an end. Hardly a man had risen in hissupport as he passed through the districts where Jacobitism boasted ofits strength. The people flocked to see his march as if to see a show.Catholics and Tories abounded in Lancashire, but only a single squiretook up arms. Manchester was looked on as the most Jacobite of Englishtowns, but all the aid it gave was an illumination and two thousandpounds. From Carlisle to Derby he had been joined by hardly two hundredmen. The policy of Walpole had in fact secured England for the House ofHanover. The long peace, the prosperity of the country, and the clemencyof the Government, had done their work. The recent admission of Toriesinto the administration had severed the Tory party finally from the mereJacobites. Jacobitism as a fighting force was dead, and even CharlesEdward saw that it was hopeless to conquer England with five thousandHighlanders.[Sidenote: Conquest of the Highlands.]He soon learned too that forces of double his own strength were closingon either side of him, while a third army under the king and Lord Staircovered London. Scotland itself, now that the Highlanders were away,quietly renewed in all the districts of the Lowlands its allegiance tothe House of Hanover. Even in the Highlands the Macleods rose in armsfor King George, while the Gordons refused to stir, though roused by asmall French force which landed at Montrose. To advance further southwas impossible, and Charles fell rapidly back on Glasgow; but thereinforcements which he found there raised his army to nine thousandmen, and on the 23rd January 1746 he boldly attacked an English armyunder General Hawley which had followed his retreat and had encampednear Falkirk. Again the wild charge of his Highlanders won victory forthe Prince, but victory was as fatal as defeat. The bulk of his forcesdispersed with their booty to the mountains, and Charles fell sullenlyback to the north before the Duke of Cumberland. On the 16th of Aprilthe two armies faced one another on Culloden Moor, a few miles eastwardof Inverness. The Highlanders still numbered six thousand men, but theywere starving and dispirited, while Cumberland's force was nearly doublethat of the Prince. Torn by the Duke's guns, the clansmen flungthemselves in their old fashion on the English front; but they werereceived with a terrible fire of musketry, and the few that brokethrough the first line found themselves fronted by a second. In a fewmoments all was over, and the Stuart force was a mass of huntedfugitives. Charles himself after strange adventures escaped to France.In England fifty of his followers were hanged; three Scotch lords,Lovat, Balmerino, and Kilmarnock, brought to the block; and fortypersons of rank attainted by Act of Parliament. More extensive measuresof repression were needful in the Highlands. The feudal tenures wereabolished. The hereditary jurisdictions of the chiefs were bought up andtransferred to the Crown. The tartan, or garb of the Highlanders, wasforbidden by law. These measures, and a general Act of Indemnity whichfollowed them, proved effective for their purpose. The dread of theclansmen passed away, and the sheriff's writ soon ran through theHighlands with as little resistance as in the streets of Edinburgh.[Sidenote: Widening of the War.]Defeat abroad and danger at home only quickened the resolve of thePelhams to bring the war, so far as England and Prussia went, to an end.When England was threatened by a Catholic Pretender, it was no time forweakening the chief Protestant power in Germany. On the refusaltherefore of Maria Theresa to join in a general peace, England concludedthe Convention of Hanover with Prussia at the close of August, andwithdrew so far as Germany was concerned from the war. Elsewhere howeverthe contest lingered on. The victories of Maria Theresa in Italy werebalanced by those of France in the Netherlands, where Marshal Saxeinflicted new defeats on the English and Dutch at Roucoux and Lauffeld.The danger of Holland and the financial exhaustion of France at lastbrought about in 1748 the conclusion of a peace at Aix-la-Chapelle, bywhich England surrendered its gains at sea, and France its conquests onland. But the peace was a mere pause in the struggle, during which bothparties hoped to gain strength for a mightier contest which they sawimpending. The war was in fact widening far beyond the bounds of Germanyor of Europe. It was becoming a world-wide duel which was to settle thedestinies of mankind. Already France was claiming the valleys of theOhio and the Mississippi, and mooting the great question whether thefortunes of the New World were to be moulded by Frenchmen or Englishmen.Already too French adventurers were driving English merchants fromMadras, and building up, as they trusted, a power which was to add Indiato the dominions of France.[Sidenote: Clive.]The intercourse of England with India had as yet given little promise ofthe great fortunes which awaited it. It was not till the close ofElizabeth's reign, a century after Vasco de Gama had crept round theCape of Good Hope and founded the Portuguese settlement on the GoaCoast, that an East India Company was founded in London. The trade,profitable as it was, remained small in extent; and the three earlyfactories of the Company were only gradually acquired during the centurywhich followed. The first, that of Madras, consisted of but sixfishermen's houses beneath Fort St. George; that of Bombay was ceded bythe Portuguese as part of the dowry of Catharine of Braganza; while FortWilliam, with the mean village which has since grown into Calcutta, owesits origin to the reign of William the Third. Each of these forts wasbuilt simply for the protection of the Company's warehouses, and guardedby a few "sepahis," sepoys, or paid native soldiers; while the clerksand traders of each establishment were under the direction of aPresident and a Council. One of these clerks in the middle of theeighteenth century was Robert Clive, the son of a small proprietor nearMarket Drayton in Shropshire, an idle daredevil of a boy whom hisfriends had been glad to get rid of by packing him off in the Company'sservice as a writer to Madras. His early days there were days ofwretchedness and despair. He was poor and cut off from his fellows bythe haughty shyness of his temper, weary of desk-work, and haunted byhome-sickness. Twice he attempted suicide; and it was only on thefailure of his second attempt that he flung down the pistol whichbaffled him, with a conviction that he was reserved for higher things.[Sidenote: Dupleix.]A change came at last in the shape of war and captivity. As soon as thewar of the Austrian Succession broke out the superiority of the Frenchin power and influence tempted them to expel the English from India.Labourdonnais, the governor of the French colony of the Mauritius,besieged Madras, razed it to the ground, and carried its clerks andmerchants prisoners to Pondicherry. Clive was among these captives, buthe escaped in disguise, and returning to the settlement, threw aside hisclerkship for an ensign's commission in a force which the Company wasbusily raising. For the capture of Madras had not only established therepute of the French arms, but had roused Dupleix, the governor ofPondicherry, to conceive plans for the creation of a French empire inIndia. When the English merchants of Elizabeth's day brought their goodsto Surat, all India, save the south, had just been brought for the firsttime under the rule of a single great power by the Mogul Emperors of theline of Akbar. But with the death of Aurungzebe, in the reign of Anne,the Mogul Empire fell fast into decay. A line of feudal princes raisedthemselves to independence in Rajpootana. The lieutenants of the Emperorfounded separate sovereignties at Lucknow and Hyderabad, in theCarnatic, and in Bengal. The plain of the Upper Indus was occupied by arace of religious fanatics called the Sikhs. Persian and Affghaninvaders crossed the Indus, and succeeded even in sacking Delhi, thecapital of the Moguls. Clans of systematic plunderers, who were knownunder the name of Mahrattas, and who were in fact the natives whomconquest had long held in subjection, poured down from the highlandsalong the western coast, ravaged as far as Calcutta and Tanjore, andfinally set up independent states at Poonah and Gwalior.[Sidenote: Arcot.]Dupleix skilfully availed himself of the disorder around him. He offeredhis aid to the Emperor against the rebels and invaders who had reducedhis power to a shadow; and it was in the Emperor's name that he meddledwith the quarrels of the states of Central and Southern India, madehimself virtually master of the Court of Hyderabad, and seated acreature of his own on the throne of the Carnatic. Trichinopoly, the onetown which held out against this Nabob of the Carnatic, was all butbrought to surrender when Clive, in 1751, came forward with a daringscheme for its relief. With a few hundred English and sepoys he pushedthrough a thunderstorm to the surprise of Arcot, the Nabob's capital,entrenched himself in its enormous fort, and held it for fifty daysagainst thousands of assailants. Moved by his gallantry, the Mahrattas,who had never before believed that Englishmen would fight, advanced andbroke up the siege. But Clive was no sooner freed than he showed equalvigour in the field. At the head of raw recruits who ran away at thefirst sound of a gun, and sepoys who hid themselves as soon as thecannon opened fire, he twice attacked and defeated the French and theirIndian allies, foiled every effort of Dupleix, and razed to the ground apompous pillar which the French governor had set up in honour of hisearlier victories.[Sidenote: The American Colonies.]Clive was recalled by broken health to England, and the fortunes of thestruggle in India were left for decision to a later day. But whileFrance was struggling for the Empire of the East she was striving witheven more apparent success for the command of the new world of the West.From the time when the Puritan emigration added the four New EnglandStates, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island tothose of Maryland and Virginia the progress of the English colonies inNorth America had been slow, but it had never ceased. Settlers stillcame, though in smaller numbers, and two new colonies south of Virginiareceived from Charles the Second their name of the Carolinas. The warwith Holland in 1664 transferred to British rule a district claimed bythe Dutch from the Hudson to the inner Lakes; and this country, whichwas granted by Charles to his brother, received from him the name of NewYork. Portions were soon broken off from its vast territory to form thecolonies of New Jersey and Delaware. In 1682 a train of Quakers followedWilliam Penn across the Delaware into the heart of the primaeval forest,and became a colony which recalled its founder and the woodlands amongwhich he planted it in its name of Pennsylvania. A long interval elapsedbefore a new settlement, which received its title of Georgia from thereigning sovereign, George the Second, was established by GeneralOglethorpe on the Savannah as a refuge for English debtors and for thepersecuted Protestants of Germany.[Sidenote: Their progress.]Slow as this progress seemed, the colonies were really growing fast innumbers and in wealth. Their whole population amounted at the time wehave reached to about 1,200,000 whites and a quarter of a million ofnegroes; and this amounted to nearly a fourth of that of the mothercountry. Its increase indeed was amazing. The inhabitants of Virginiawere doubling in every twenty-one years, while Massachusetts sawfive-and-twenty new towns spring into existence in a quarter of acentury. The wealth of the colonists was growing even faster than theirnumbers. As yet the southern colonies were the more productive. Virginiaboasted of its tobacco plantations, Georgia and the Carolinas of theirmaize and rice and indigo crops, while New York and Pennsylvania, with,the colonies of New England, were restricted to their whale and codfisheries, their corn-harvests, and their timber trade. The distinctionindeed between the northern and southern colonies was more than anindustrial one. While New England absorbed half a million of whites, andthe middle colonies from the Hudson to the Potomac contained almost asmany, there were less than 300,000 whites in those to the south of thePotomac. These on the other hand contained 130,000 negroes, and thecentral States 70,000, while but 11,000 were found in the States of NewEngland. In the Southern States this prevalence of slavery produced anaristocratic spirit and favoured the creation of large estates; even thesystem of entails had been introduced among the wealthy planters ofVirginia, where many of the older English families found representativesin houses such as those of Fairfax and Washington. Throughout NewEngland, on the other hand, the characteristics of the Puritans, theirpiety, their intolerance, their simplicity of life, their pedantry,their love of equality and tendency to democratic institutions, remainedunchanged. There were few large fortunes, though the comfort wasgeneral. "Some of the most considerable provinces of America," saidBurke in 1769, "such for instance as Connecticut and Massachusetts Bay,have not in each of them two men who can afford at a distance from theirestates to spend a thousand pounds a year." In education and politicalactivity New England stood far ahead of its fellow-colonies, for thesettlement of the Puritans had been followed at once by theestablishment of a system of local schools which is still the glory ofAmerica. "Every township," it was enacted, "after the Lord hathincreased them to the number of fifty householders, shall appoint one toteach all children to write and read; and when any town shall increaseto the number of a hundred families, they shall set up a grammarschool." The result was that in the midst of the eighteenth century NewEngland was the one part of the world where every man and woman was ableto read and write.[Sidenote: Their political condition.]Great however as these differences were, and great as was to be theirinfluence on American history, they were little felt as yet. In the mainfeatures of their outer organization the whole of the colonies stoodfairly at one. In religious and in civil matters alike all of themcontrasted sharply with the England at home. Europe saw for the firsttime a state growing up amidst the forests of the West where religiousfreedom had become complete. Religious tolerance had in fact beenbrought about by a medley of religious faiths such as the world hadnever seen before. New England was still a Puritan stronghold. In allthe Southern colonies the Episcopal Church was established by law, andthe bulk of the settlers clung to it; but Roman Catholics formed a largepart of the population of Maryland. Pennsylvania was a State of Quakers.Presbyterians and Baptists had fled from tests and persecutions tocolonize New Jersey. Lutherans and Moravians from Germany abounded amongthe settlers of Carolina and Georgia. In such a chaos of creedsreligious persecution became impossible. There was the same outerdiversity and the same real unity in the political tendency andorganization of the States. The colonists proudly looked on theConstitutions of their various States as copies of that of the mothercountry. England had given them her system of self-government, as shehad given them her law, her language, her religion, and her blood. Butthe circumstances of their settlement had freed them from many of theworst abuses which clogged the action of constitutional government athome. The representative suffrage was in some cases universal and inall proportioned to population. There were no rotten boroughs, andmembers of the legislative assemblies were subject to annualre-election. The will of the settlers told in this way directly andimmediately on the legislation in a way unknown to the EnglishParliament, and the settlers were men whose will was braced andinvigorated by their personal independence and comfort, the tradition oftheir past, and the personal temper which was created by the greaterloneliness and self-dependence of their lives. Whether the spirit of thecolony was democratic, moderate, or oligarchical, its form of governmentwas pretty much the same. The original rights of the proprietor, theprojector and grantee of the earliest settlement, had in all cases, savein those of Pennsylvania and Maryland, either ceased to exist or falleninto desuetude. The government of each colony lay in a House of Assemblyelected by the people at large, with a Council sometimes elected,sometimes nominated by the Governor, and a Governor appointed by theCrown, or, as in Connecticut and Rhode Island, chosen by the colonists.[Sidenote: English control.]With the appointment of these Governors all administrative interferenceon the part of the Government at home practically ended. Thesuperintendence of the colonies rested with a Board for Trade andPlantations, which, though itself without executive power, advised theSecretary of State for the Southern Department, within which America wasincluded. But for two centuries they were left by a happy neglect tothemselves. It was wittily said at a later day that "Mr. Grenville lostAmerica because he read the American despatches, which none of hispredecessors ever did." There was little room indeed for anyinterference within the limits of the colonies. Their privileges weresecured by royal charters. Their Assemblies alone exercised the right ofinternal taxation, and they exercised it sparingly. Walpole, like Pittafterwards, set roughly aside the project for an American excise. "Ihave Old England set against me," he said, "by this measure, and do youthink I will have New England too?" America, in fact, contributed toEngland's resources not by taxation, but by the monopoly of her trade.It was from England that she might import, to England alone that shemight send her exports. She was prohibited from manufacturing her ownproducts, or from exporting them in any but a raw state for manufacturein the mother country. But even in matters of trade the supremacy of themother country was far from being a galling one. There were some smallimport duties, but they were evaded by a well-understood system ofsmuggling. The restriction of trade with the colonies to Great Britainwas more than compensated by the commercial privileges which theAmericans enjoyed as British subjects.[Sidenote: French aggression.]As yet therefore there was nothing to break the good will which thecolonists felt towards the mother country, while the danger of Frenchaggression drew them closely to it. Populous as they had become, Englishsettlements still lay mainly along the seaboard of the Atlantic; foronly a few exploring parties had penetrated into the Alleghanies beforethe Seven Years' War; and Indian tribes wandered unquestioned along thelakes. It was not till the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 that thepretensions of France drew the eyes of the colonists and of Englishstatesmen to the interior of the Western continent. Planted firmly inLouisiana and Canada, France openly claimed the whole country west ofthe Alleghanies as its own, and its governors now ordered all Englishsettlers or merchants to be driven from the valleys of Ohio orMississippi which were still in the hands of Indian tribes. Even theinactive Pelham revolted against pretensions such as these; and the Dukeof Bedford, who was then Secretary for the Southern Department, wasstirred to energetic action. The original French settlers were drivenfrom Acadia or Nova Scotia, and an English colony planted there, whosesettlement of Halifax still bears the name of its founder Lord Halifax,the head of the Board of Trade. An Ohio Company was formed, and itsagents made their way to the valleys of that river and the Kentucky;while envoys from Virginia and Pennsylvania drew closer the alliancebetween their colonies and the Indian tribes across the mountains. Norwere the French slow to accept the challenge. Fighting began in Acadia.A vessel of war appeared in Ontario, and Niagara was turned into a fort.A force of 1200 men despatched to Erie drove the few English settlersfrom their little colony on the fork of the Ohio, and founded there afort called Duquesne, on the site of the later Pittsburg. The fort atonce gave this force command of the river valley. After a fruitlessattack on it under George Washington, a young Virginian, who had beendespatched with a handful of men to meet the danger, the colonists wereforced to withdraw over the mountains, and the whole of the west wasleft in the hands of France.[Sidenote: Rout of Braddock.]It was natural that at such a crisis the mother country should look tothe united efforts of the colonies, and Halifax pressed for a jointarrangement which should provide a standing force and funds for itssupport. A plan for this purpose on the largest scale was drawn up byBenjamin Franklin, who, from a printer's boy, had risen to supremeinfluence in Pennsylvania; but in the way of such a union stood thejealousies which each state entertained of its neighbour, thedisinclination of the colonists to be drawn into an expensive struggle,and, above all, suspicion of the motives of Halifax and his colleagues.The delay in furnishing any force for defence, the impossibility ofbringing the colonies to any agreement, and the perpetual squabbles oftheir legislatures with the governors appointed by the Crown, may havebeen the motives which induced Halifax to introduce a Bill which wouldhave made orders by the king in spite of the colonial charters law inAmerica. The Bill was dropped in deference to the constitutionalobjections of wiser men; but the governors fed the fear in England ofthe "levelling principles" of the colonists, and every official inAmerica wrote home to demand that Parliament should do what the coloniallegislatures seemed unable to do, and establish a common fund fordefence by a general taxation. Already plans were mooted for deriving arevenue from the colonies. But the prudence of Pelham clung to thepolicy of Walpole, and nothing was done; while the nearer approach of astruggle in Europe gave fresh vigour to the efforts of France. TheMarquis of Montcalm, who was now governor of Canada, carried out witheven greater zeal than his predecessor the plans of annexation; and thethree forts of Duquesne on the Ohio, of Niagara on the St. Lawrence, andof Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain, were linked together by a chain oflesser forts, which cut off the English colonists from all access to thewest. Montcalm was gifted with singular powers of administration; hehad succeeded in attaching the bulk of the Indian tribes from Canada asfar as the Mississippi to the cause of France; and the value of theiraid was shown in 1755, when General Braddock led a force of Englishsoldiers and American militia to a fresh attack upon fort Duquesne. Theforce was utterly routed and Braddock slain.[Sidenote: State of Europe.]The defeat woke England to its danger; for it was certain that war inAmerica would soon be followed by war in Europe itself. Newcastle andhis fellow-ministers were still true in the main to Walpole's policy.They looked on a league with Prussia as indispensable to the formationof any sound alliance which could check France. "If you gain Prussia,"wrote the veteran Lord Chancellor, Hardwicke, to Newcastle in 1748, "theConfederacy will be restored and made whole, and become a real strength;if you do not, it will continue lame and weak, and much in the power ofFrance." Frederick however held cautiously aloof from any engagement.The league between Prussia and the Queen of Hungary, which Englanddesired, Frederick knew in fact to be impossible. He knew that theQueen's passionate resolve to recover Silesia must end in a contest inwhich England must take one part or the other; and as yet, if the choicehad to be made, Austria seemed likely to be the favoured ally. Thetraditional friendship of the Whigs for that power combined with thetendencies of George the Second to make an Austrian alliance moreprobable than a Prussian one. The advances of England to Frederick onlyserved therefore to alienate Maria Theresa, whose one desire was toregain Silesia, and whose hatred and jealousy of the new Protestantpower which had so suddenly risen into rivalry with her house for thesupremacy of Germany blinded her to the older rivalry between her houseand France. The two powers of the House of Bourbon were still bound bythe Family Compact, and eager for allies in the strife with Englandwhich the struggles in India and America were bringing hourly nearer. Itwas as early as 1752 that by a startling change of policy Maria Theresadrew to their alliance. The jealousy which Russia entertained of thegrowth of a strong power in North Germany brought the Czarina Elizabethto promise aid to the schemes of the Queen of Hungary; and in 1755 theleague of the four powers and of Saxony was practically completed. Sosecret were these negotiations that they remained unknown to HenryPelham and to his brother the Duke of Newcastle, who succeeded him onhis death in 1754 as the head of the ministry. But they were detectedfrom the first by the keen eye of Frederick of Prussia, who saw himselffronted by a line of foes that stretched from Paris to St. Petersburg.[Sidenote: Alliance with Prussia.]The danger to England was hardly less; for France appeared again on thestage with a vigour and audacity which recalled the days of Lewis theFourteenth. The weakness and corruption of the French government werescreened for a time by the daring and scope of its plans, as by theability of the agents it found to carry them out. In England, on thecontrary, all was vagueness and indecision. The action of the kingshowed only his Hanoverian jealousy of the House of Brandenburg. It wascertain that France, as soon as war broke out in the West, would attackhis Electorate; and George sought help not at Berlin but at St.Petersburg. He concluded a treaty with Russia, which promised him thehelp of a Russian army on the Weser in return for a subsidy. Such atreaty meant war with Frederick, who had openly announced his refusal toallow the entry of Russian forces on German soil; and it was vehementlythough fruitlessly opposed by William Pitt. But he had hardly withdrawnwith Grenville and Charles Townshend from the Ministry when Newcastlehimself recoiled from the king's policy. The Russian subsidy wasrefused, and Hanoverian interests subordinated to those of England bythe conclusion of the treaty with Frederick of Prussia for which Pitthad pressed. The new compact simply provided for the neutrality of bothPrussia and Hanover in any contest between England and France. But itsresults were far from being as peaceable as its provisions. Russia wasoutraged by Frederick's open opposition to her presence in Germany;France resented his compact with and advances towards England; and MariaTheresa eagerly seized on the temper of both those powers to draw theminto common action against the Prussian king. With the treaty betweenEngland and Frederick indeed began the Seven Years' War.[Sidenote: The Seven Years' War.]No war has had greater results on the history of the world or broughtgreater triumphs to England: but few have had more disastrousbeginnings. Newcastle was too weak and ignorant to rule without aid, andyet too greedy of power to purchase aid by sharing it with more capablemen. His preparations for the gigantic struggle before him may beguessed from the fact that there were but three regiments fit forservice in England at the opening of 1756. France on the other hand wasquick in her attack. Port Mahon in Minorca, the key of theMediterranean, was besieged by the Duke of Richelieu and forced tocapitulate. To complete the shame of England, a fleet sent to its reliefunder Admiral Byng fell back before the French. In Germany Frederickseized Dresden at the outset of the war and forced the Saxon army tosurrender; and in 1757 a victory at Prague made him master for a whileof Bohemia; but his success was transient, and a defeat at Kolin drovehim to retreat again into Saxony. In the same year the Duke ofCumberland, who had taken post on the Weser with an army of fiftythousand men for the defence of Hanover, fell back before a French armyto the mouth of the Elbe, and engaged by the Convention of Closter-Sevento disband his forces. In America things went even worse than inGermany. The inactivity of the English generals was contrasted with thegenius and activity of Montcalm. Already masters of the Ohio by thedefeat of Braddock, the French drove the English garrison from the fortswhich commanded Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, and their empirestretched without a break over the vast territory from Louisiana to theSt. Lawrence.[Sidenote: William Pitt.]A despondency without parallel in our history took possession of ourcoolest statesmen, and even the impassive Chesterfield cried in despair,"We are no longer a nation." But the nation of which Chesterfielddespaired was really on the eve of its greatest triumphs, and theincapacity of Newcastle only called to the front the genius of WilliamPitt. Pitt was the grandson of a wealthy governor of Madras, who hadentered Parliament in 1735, as member for one of his father's pocketboroughs. A group of younger men, Lord Lyttelton, the Grenvilles,Wilkes, and others, gradually gathered round him, and formed a band ofyoung "patriots," "the Boys," as Walpole called them, who added to thedifficulties of that minister. Pitt was as yet a cornet of horse, andthe restless activity of his genius was seen in the energy with whichhe threw himself into his military duties. He told Lord Shelburne longafterwards that "during the time he was cornet of horse there was not amilitary book he did not read through." But the dismissal from the armywith which Walpole met his violent attacks threw this energy wholly intopolitics. His fiery spirit was hushed in office during the "broad-bottomadministration" which followed Walpole's fall, and he soon attainedgreat influence over Henry Pelham. "I think him," wrote Pelham to hisbrother, "the most able and useful man we have amongst us; truly
