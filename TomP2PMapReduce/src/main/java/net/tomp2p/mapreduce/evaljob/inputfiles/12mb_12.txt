which must only be considered as a mere feint to recover herbreath, before she again renews her frenzied efforts to humiliateEngland, and obtain universal dominion.CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.London, June, 1837.To one who has visited foreign climes, how very substantial everythingappears in England, from the child's plaything to the Duke of York'scolumn!  To use a joiners phrase, everything abroad is comparativelyscamp-work.  Talk about the Palais Royale, the Rue Richelieu, and thesplendour of the Parisian shops--why, two hundred yards ofRegent-street, commencing from Howell and James's, would buy the wholeof them, and leave a balance sufficient to buy the remainder of theFrench _expositions_.  But still, if more substantial and massive, weare at the same time also heavy.  We want more space, more air, moreroom to breathe, in London; we are too closely packed; we want gardenswith trees to absorb the mephitic air, for what our lungs reject issuitable to vegetation.  But we cannot have all we want in this world,so we must do without them.What wealth is now pouring into the country! and, thank God, it is nowsomewhat better expended than it was in the bubble mania, which actedupon the plethora certainly, but bled us too freely and uselessly.  Therail-road speculators have taken off many millions, and the money iswell employed; for even allowing that, in some instances, theexpectations of the parties who speculate may be disappointed, still itis spent in the country; and not only is it affording employment andsustenance to thousands, but the staple produce of England only isconsumed.  In these speculations--in the millions required andimmediately produced, you can witness the superiority of England.Undertakings from which foreign governments would shrink with dismay arehere effected by the meeting of a few individuals.And now for my commissions.  What a list!  And the first item is--twoCanary birds, the last having been one fine morning found dead: nobodyknows how; there was plenty of seed and water (put in after the servantfound that they had been starved by his neglect), which, of course,proved that they did not die for want of food.  I hate what are calledpets; they are a great nuisance, for they will die, and then such alamentation over them!  In the "Fire Worshippers" Moore makes his Hindasay--  "I never nursed a dear gazelle,  To glad me with its soft black eye,  But when it came to know me well  And love me--it was sure to die."Now Hinda was perfectly correct, except in thinking that she waspeculiarly unfortunate.  Every one who keeps pets might tell the sametale as Hinda.  I recollect once a Canary bird died, and my young peoplewere in a great tribulation; so to amuse them we made them a papercoffin, put the defunct therein, and sewed on the lid, dug a grave inthe garden, and dressing them out in any remnants of black we could findfor weepers, made a procession to the grave where it was buried.  Thislittle divertissement quite took their fancy.  The next day one of theyoungest came up to me and said, "Oh, papa, when will you die?"--Astrange question, thought I, quite forgetting the procession of the daybefore.--"Why do you ask, my dear?"--"Oh, because it will be such funburying you."--"Much obliged to you, my love."There is much more intellect in birds than people suppose.  An instanceof that occurred the other day, at a slate quarry belonging to a friend,from whom I have the narrative.  A thrush, not aware of the expansiveproperties of gunpowder, thought proper to build her nest on a ridge ofthe quarry, in the very centre of which they were constantly blastingthe rock.  At first she was very much discomposed by the fragmentsflying in all directions, but still she would not, quit her chosenlocality; she soon observed that a bell rang whenever a train was aboutto be fired, and that, at the notice, the workmen retired to safepositions.  In a few days, when she heard the bell, she quitted herexposed situation, and flew down to where the workmen shelteredthemselves, dropping close to their feet.  There she would remain untilthe explosion had taken place, and then return to her nest.  Theworkmen, observing this, narrated it to their employers, and it was alsotold to visitors who came to view the quarry.The visitors naturally expressed a wish to witness so curious a specimenof intellect; but, as the rock could not always be ready to be blastedwhen visitors came, the bell was rung instead, and, for a few times,answered the same purpose.  The thrush flew down close to where theystood; but she perceived that she was trifled with, and it interferedwith her process of incubation: the consequence was, that afterwards,when the bell was rung, she would peep over the ledge to ascertain ifthe workmen did retreat, and if they did not, she would remain where shewas, probably saying to herself, "No, no, gentlemen; I'm not to beroused off my eggs merely for your amusement."Some birds have a great deal of humour in them, particularly the raven.One that belonged to me was the most mischievous and amusing creature Iever met with.  He would get into the flower-garden, go to the bedswhere the gardener had sowed a great variety of seeds, with sticks putin the ground with labels, and then he would amuse himself with pullingup every stick, and laying them in heaps of ten or twelve on the path.This used to irritate the old gardener very much, who would drive himaway.  The raven knew that he ought not to do it, or he would not havedone it.  He would soon return to his mischief, and when the gardeneragain chased him (the old man could not walk very fast), the raven wouldkeep just clear of the rake or hoc in his hand, dancing back before him,and singing as plain as a man could, "Tol de rol de rol; tol de rol derol!" with all kinds of mimicking gestures.  The bird is alive now, andcontinues the same meritorious practice whenever he can find anopportunity.CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.                                     June, Steam-boat Princess Victoria.It certainly appears that the motion of a steam-vessel produces morenausea than that of a sailing-vessel; and people appear to suffer insome degree in proportion to the power of the engines.  This may beaccounted for by the vibration of the vessel increasing in the sameratio.We are now in a vessel of two hundred and fifty horse power, and theconsequence is that the passengers are as sick as two hundred and fiftyhorses.  The effect of the vibration of the after part of the vesselamounts to the ridiculous.When dinner was put on the table, we had no occasion for a bell toannounce it, for every glass on the table was dancing to its ownjingling music.  And when the covers were taken off, it was still moreabsurd--everything in the dishes appeared to be infected with SaintVitus's dance.  The boiled leg of mutton shook its collops of fat at acouple of fowls which figured in a sarabande round and round their owndish,--roast beef shifted about with a slow and stately movement--a ham_glisseed croisee_ from one side to the other--tongues wagged that werenever meant to wag again--bottles reeled and fell over like drunken men,and your piece of bread constantly ran away and was to be pulled backinto its proper place.  It was a regular jig-a-jig--a country-dance ofpousette, down the middle, and right and left.The communication of motion was strange; the whole company seated onlong forms were jig-a-jigging up and down together--your knife jiggedand your fork jigged--even the morsel which was put into your mouth gaveone more jump before it could be seized.  However, we jigged it to somepurpose; for, in eighteen hours and a half, we passed from London toAntwerp.The English are naturally great _voyageurs_: the feeling is inherentfrom our insular position.  I have been reflecting whether I canrecollect, in my whole life, ever to have been three months in oneplace, but I cannot, nor do I believe that I ever was--not even whensent to school; for I used to run away every quarter, just to see how myfamily were--an amiable weakness, which even flogging could noteradicate.  And then I was off to sea; there I had my wish, asShakespeare says, borne away by "the viewless winds, and blown withrestless violence about the pendent world," north, south, east, andwest; one month freezing, the next burning; all nations, all colours,--white, copper, brown, and black; all scenery, from the blasted pinetowering amidst the frost and snow, to the cocoa-nut waving its leavesto the sea-breeze.  Well, "homekeeping youths have homely wits," saysthe same author; and he has told more truth than any man who ever wrote.I certainly did hear of one young man who did not gain much bytravelling; he was a banker's clerk, and obtained three months' vacationto go on the Continent.  He landed at Ostend, and the next day foundhimself in the track-schuyt that is towed by horses, from Bruges toGhent.  The cabins were magnificent, velvet and gold the down cushionsluxurious, the dinner and breakfast sumptuous, the wine excellent, thebed-rooms comfortable, and the expense moderate.  Moreover, the motionwas imperceptible.  What could a man wish more?  He arrived at Ghent,and could not make his mind up to quit this barge; so he returned in herto Bruges, and then back again to Ghent; and thus he continued betweenthe two towns, backwards and forwards, until the three months' leave hadexpired, and he was obliged to return to the desk.  I have never yetmade up my mind whether this personage was a wise man or a fool.But, until the opening of the Continent, the English were onlyvoyageurs, not travellers; and that, after having been so long debarred,they should be desirous of visiting the various portions of Europe, isnot only natural but praiseworthy; but that they should make theContinent their residence--should expatriate themselves altogether, is,to me, a source of astonishment as well as of regret.The excuse offered is the cheapness.  It is but an excuse, for I deny itto be the fact: I have visited most places, with and without a family;and I will positively assert, not for the benefit of others who havealready expatriated themselves, but as a check to those who feel soinclined, that they will discover too soon that, at less expense, theycan command more good living and substantial comforts in England, thanin any part of the Continent they may fix upon as their habitation.Let us enter a little into the subject.  First, as to the capitals,Paris, Brussels, etcetera.Let it first be remembered that we have no longer war prices in England,that almost every article has fallen from thirty-five to fifty per cent.It is true that some tradespeople who are established as fashionablekeep up their prices; but it is not absolutely necessary to employ them,as there are those equally skilled who are more moderate.  But even themost fashionable have been obliged, to a certain degree, to lower theirprices; and their present prices, reduced as they are, will mostassuredly die with them.Everything will, by degrees, find its level; but this level is not to befound at once.  Should peace continue, ten years from this date willmake a great alteration in every article, not only of necessity, but ofluxury; and then, after having been the dearest, England will become thecheapest residence in the world.  House rent in the capitals abroad iscertainly as dear, if not dearer than it is in England.  There aresituations more or less fashionable in every metropolis; and if you wishto reside in those quarters, you pay accordingly.  It is true that, bytaking a portion of a house, you to a certain degree indemnifyyourself;--a first, second, or third story, with a common staircaseloaded with dirt and filth; but is this equal to the comfort of a cleanEnglish house, in which you have your own servants, and are notoverlooked by your neighbours?  If they were to let out houses in floorsin England as they do in Paris and elsewhere, a less sum would bedemanded.  You may procure a handsome house in a fashionable quarter,well furnished, in London, for 300 pounds per annum.  Go to the PlaceVendome, or those quarters styled the English quarters, at Paris, andwhich are by no means the most fashionable quarters, and you will payfor a handsome front floor 700 francs per month; so that for one floorof a house in Paris you will pay 336 pounds per annum, when in Londonyou will obtain the whole house for 300 pounds.  The proprietor of theParis house, therefore, receives much more by letting his floorsseparate than the English do.  The common articles of necessity are asdear, if not dearer abroad; the _octroi_ duty upon all that enters thebarriers raising the price excessively.  Meat at Paris or Brussels is asdear as in London, and not so good; it is as dear, because they chargeyou the same price all round, about 5 pence per pound, independent ofits inferiority and the villainous manner in which it is cut up.  Ourbutchers only butcher the animal, but foreign butchers butcher the meat.Poultry is as dear; game much dearer; and so is fish.  Indeed, fish isnot only dear, but scarce and bad.  Horses and carriages are quite asdear abroad, in the capitals, as in London.  Clothes are in somerespects cheaper, in others dearer, especially articles of Englishmanufacture, which are more sought after than any others.Amusements are said to be cheaper; but, admitting that, the places ofamusement are oftener resorted to, and in consequence as much money isspent abroad as in England.  It is true that there are an immense numberof theatres in Paris, and that most of them are very reasonable in theircharges for admission; but be it recollected that there are not abovethree of them which are considered fashionable, if even respectable; andthere the prices are sufficiently high.  If people went to Sadler'sWells, the Coburg, Victoria, Queen's Theatre, Astley's, and other minortheatres in London, as they do to the Theatres Saint Martin, Gymnase, etVarietes at Paris, they would find no great difference in the prices.What then is there cheaper?  Wine.  I grant it; and, it is alsoasserted, the education of children.  We will pass over these two lastpoints for the present, and examine whether living is cheaper on theContinent, provided you do _not_ hive in any of the capitals.That at Tours and other places in the south of France, at Genoa, atBruges, in Belgium, you may live cheaper than in London, I grant; but ifany one means to assert that you can live cheaper than in the country inEngland, I deny it altogether.  People go abroad, and select thecheapest parts of the Continent to live in.  If they were to do the samein England, they would find that they could live much cheaper and muchbetter; for instance, in Devonshire, Cornwall, and Wales, and, indeed,in almost every county in England.The fact is, it is not the cheapness of the living which induces so manypeople to reside abroad.  There are many reasons; and as I wish to becharitable, I will put forward the most favourable ones.In England, we are money-making people, and we have the aristocracy ofwealth as well _as_ the aristocracy of rank.  It has long been thecustom for many people to live beyond their incomes, and to keep up anappearance which their means have not warranted.  Many, especially thelanded proprietors, finding their rentals reduced from various causes,have been necessitated to retrench.  They were too proud to put downtheir carriages and establishments before the eyes of those who hadperhaps looked upon them with envy, and whose derision or exultationthey anticipated.  They therefore have retired to the Continent, where acarriage is not necessary to prove that you are a gentleman.  Shouldthose return who have emigrated for the above reasons, they would findthat this striving for show is hardly perceptible now in England.  Thosewho have remained have either had sense enough, or have been forced bycircumstances, to reduce their expenditure.Another cause is the easy introduction into what is called good societyabroad on the Continent, but which is in reality very bad society.Certainly there are a sufficient number of Counts, Viscounts, andMarquesses to associate with; but in France high birth is not proved bytitles, which are of little or no value, and do not even establishgentility.  This society may certainly be entered into at a much lessexpense than that of England, especially in the metropolis; but, dependupon it, there is a species of society dear at any price.With respect to education of children, that boys may receive advantagefrom a Continental education I admit; but woe be to the mother whointrusts her daughter to the ruin of a French _Pension_!In England there are many excellent schools in the country, as cheap andcheaper than on the Continent: but the schoolmasters near London,generally speaking, are ruining them by their adherence to the oldsystem, and their extravagant terms.  The _system_ of education on theContinent is certainly superior to that of England, and the attention tothe pupils is greater: of course there are bad schools abroad as well asin England; but the balance is much in favour of those on the Continent,with the advantage of being at nearly one-half the expense.  A greatalteration has taken place in modern education; the living languages andmathematics have been found to be preferable to the classics and otherinstruction still adhered to in the English schools.I have always considered, and have every reason to be confirmed in myopinion, that the foundation of all education is mathematics.  Everything else may be obtained by rote, and without thinking; but from theelements of arithmetic up to Euclid and algebra, no boy can work histask without thinking.  I never yet knew a man who was a goodmathematician who was not well-informed upon almost every point; and thereason is clear--mathematics have prepared his mind to receive andretain.  In all foreign schools this important branch of education ismore attended to than it is in England; and that alone would be asufficient reason for me to give them the preference.  In point ofmorals, I consider the schools of both countries much upon a par;although, from the system abroad of never debasing a child by corporalpunishment, I give the foreign schools the preference even in thatpoint.I consider, then, that boys are better educated abroad than in England,and acquire much more correctly the living languages, which are of moreuse to them than the classics.  So much I can say in favour of theContinent; but in every other respect I consider the advantage in favourof England.  Young women who have been brought up abroad I consider,generally speaking, as unfitted for English wives; and that in thisopinion I am not singular, I know well from conversation with young menat the clubs and elsewhere.  Mothers who have returned with theirdaughters full of French fashions and ideas, and who imagine that theywill inevitably succeed in making good matches, would be a littlemortified and surprised to hear the young men, when canvassing amongthemselves the merits of the other sex, declare that "such a young ladymay be very handsome and very clever, but she has received a_Continental education_, and that won't do for them."  Many mothersimagine, because their daughters, who are bold and free in theirmanners, and talk and laugh loud, are surrounded by young men, while themodest girl, who holds aloof, is apparently neglected, that theirdaughters are more admired; but this is a great mistake.  Men like thatboldness, that coquetry, that dash, if I may use the term, because itamuses for the time being; but although they may pay attention to womenon that account, marrying them is quite another affair.  No: the modestretiring girl, who is apparently passed by, becomes the wife; the othersare flattered before their faces, and laughed at behind their backs.  Itcertainly is unmanly, on the part of our sex, to behave in this manner,to encourage young women in their follies, and ruin them for their ownamusement; as Shakespeare says:--  "Shame to him whose cruel striking  Kills for faults of his own liking."But so it is, and so it will be so long as the world lasts, and mankindis no better than it is at present.If then, as I have asserted, there is so little to be gained by leavinga comfortable home, what is the inducement which takes so many peopleabroad to settle there?  I am afraid that the true reason has been givenby the author whom I now quote.  Speaking of the French metropolis, shesays--"I have been lately trying to investigate the nature of the charm whichrenders Paris so favourite a sojourn of the English."In point of gaiety (for gaiety read dissipation) it affords nothingcomparable with that of London.  A few ministerial fetes every wintermay perhaps exceed in brilliancy the balls given in our common routineof things; but for one entertainment in Paris at least thirty take place_chez nous_.  Society is established with us on a wider and moresplendid scale.  The weekly _soirees_, on the other hand, which properlyrepresent the society of this place, are dull, meagre, and formal to thelast degree of formality.  There is no brilliant point of reunion as atAlmack's,--no theatre uniting, like our Italian Opera, the charm of thebest company, the best music, and the best dancing.  Of the thousand andone theatres boasted of by the Parisians, only three are of a nature tobe frequented by people of consideration, the remainder being as muchout of the question as the Pavilion or the Garrick.  Dinner partiesthere are none; water parties none; _dejeuners_, unless given by aforeign ambassadress, none.  A thousand accessories to London amusementsare here wanting.  In the month of May, I am told, the public gardensand the Bois de Boulogne become enchanting.  But what is not charming inthe month of May?  Paris, perhaps, least of all places; for at thecommencement of the month every French family of note quits themetropolis for its country seat, or for sea or mineral bathing.Foreigners and the mercantile and ministerial classes alone remain.What, then, I would fain discover, constitutes the peculiar merit ofinducing persons uninstigated by motives of economy to fix themselves inthe comfortless and filthy city, and call it Paradise?  Alas! mysolution of the problem is far from honourable to the taste of ourabsentees.  _In Paris people are far less amenable than in London to thetribunal of public opinion_; or, as a lady once very candidly said tome, `One gets rid of one's friends and relations.'"Indeed, there are so many petty annoyances and vexatious of lifeattendant upon residents abroad, that it must require some strongmotives to induce them to remain.  Wherever the English settle theyraise the price of everything, much to the annoyance of the _rentiers_and respectable people of the place, although of advantage to thecountry generally.  The really highbred and aristocratic people will notassociate with the English, and look upon them with any feeling but goodwill.  With regard to servants, they are invariably badly served,although they pay two or three times the wages that are paid by theinhabitants, who, in most places, have made it a rule never to take adomestic that has once lived in an English family; the consequence isthat those engaged by the English are of the worst description, a sortof _pariahs_ among the community, who extort and cheat their employerswithout mercy.  If not permitted so to do, they leave them at a minuteswarning; and you cannot go to any foreign colony of English peoplewithout listening to very justified tirades of the villany of theservants.  Upon the same principle, there are few places abroad wherethe tradespeople have not two prices; one for the English, and the otherfor the inhabitants.I was in company with an English lady of title, who gave me a veryamusing instance of the insolence of the Belgian servants.  She had alarge family to bring up on a limited income, and had taken up her abodeat Brussels.  It should be observed that the Belgians treat theirservants like dogs, and yet it is only with the Belgians that they willbehave well.  This lady, finding her expenses very much exceeding hermeans, so soon as she had been some time in the country, attempted areformation.  Inquiring of some Belgian families with whom she wasacquainted what were the just proportions allowed by them to theirservants, she attempted by degrees to introduce the same system.  Thefirst article of wasteful expenditure was bread, and she put them uponan allowance.  The morning after she was awoke with a loud hammering inthe saloon below, the reason of which she could not comprehend; but ongoing down to breakfast she found one of the long loaves made in thecountry nailed up with tenpenny nails over the mantelpiece.  She sent toinquire who had done it, and one of the servants immediately repliedthat she had nailed it there that my lady might see that the bread didnot go too fast.There is another point on which the English abroad have long complained,and with great justice,--which is, that in every litigation or pettydispute which may appear before a smaller or more important tribunal,from the Juge de Paix to the Cour de Cassation, the verdict invariablyis given against them.  I never _heard_ an instance to the contrary,although there may have been some.  In no case can an Englishman obtainjustice; the detention of his property without just cause, all that heconsiders as law and justice in his own country, is overruled: he isobliged to submit to the greatest insults, or consent to the greatestimposition.  This is peculiarly, observable at Paris and Brussels, andit is almost a _jour de fete_ to a large portion of the inhabitants whenthey hear that an Englishman has been thrown into prison.  It must,however, be acknowledged that most of this arises not only from the wishof the rentiers, or those who live upon their means (who have thesemeans crippled by the concourse of English raising the price of everyarticle), that the English should leave and return to their own country;but also from the number of bad characters who, finding their positionin society no longer tenable in England, hasten abroad, and, by theirconduct, leave a most unfavourable impression of the English character,which, when Englishmen _only travelled_, stood high, but, now theyreside to economise, is at its lowest ebb; for the only charm which theEnglish had in the eyes of needy foreigners was their lavishing theirmoney as they passed through the country, enriching a portion of thecommunity without increasing the prices of consumption to the whole.As a proof of the insolence to which the English are subjected, I willgive the reader a verbatim copy of a letter sent to me by a friend notmore than a year ago.  I have heard of such a circumstance taking placein France, but then the innkeeper was a Chevalier of the Legion ofHonour; but this case is even more remarkable.  Depend upon it, thosewho travel will find many a Monsieur Disch before they are at the end oftheir journey.  I will vouch for the veracity of every word in theletter:--                                                "Wisbaden, July 3, 1836."My Dear --, As you kindly said that you would be glad to hear of ourprogress when any opportunity offered of writing you a letter, I nowavail myself of some friends passing through Brussels to let you knowthat thus far we have proceeded in health and safety; but whether weshall complete our project of wintering in Italy seems more and moredoubtful, as I believe the cholera to be doing its work pretty activelyin some of the states we propose to visit; and a gentleman told meyesterday, who has lately left the country, that the Pope is so glad ofan excuse to keep heretics out of his dominions, that he has never takenoff the quarantine: so that, under any circumstances, we must vegetatein some frontier hole for a fortnight before we can be admitted; acircumstance in itself sufficiently deterring, in my opinion.  Besideswhich, what with the perplexity of the coinage, and the constant attemptat pillage which we have already met with, and which, I am told, isquadrupled on the other side of the Alps, such a counterbalance existsto any of the enjoyments of travelling, that I am heartily weary of thecontinual skirmishing and _warfare_ I am subjected to;--warfare indeed,as at Cologne I was _called out_.  The story is too good to be lost, soI will tell it for your amusement and that of our friends at Brussels;moreover that you may caution every one against Mons.  Disch, of theCour Imperiale:--We had _marchandeed_ with Madame Disch for rooms, whoat last agreed to _our_ terms; but when the bill came, she changed her_own_.  We remonstrated, and the bill was altered; but Mons.  Disch madehis appearance before I could pay it, insisting on the larger sum,saying his wife had no business to make a bargain for him.  Iremonstrated in vain, and Mrs -- commenced most eloquently to state thecase: he was, however, deaf to reason, argument, eloquence, and beauty.At last I said, `Do not waste words the matter, I will pay the fellowand have done with him, taking care that neither I nor my friends willever come to his house again,' at the same time snatching the bill fromhis hand when he demanded, in a great fury, what I meant by that;exclaiming, `I am Germans gentlemans,--you English gentlemans, Ichallenge you--I challenge you.'  Although somewhat wroth before this.I was so amused that I laughed in the rascal's face, which doubled hisrage, and he reiterated his mortal defiance; adding,--`I was in Londonlast year; they charge me twelve--fourteen shillings for my dinner atcoffee-house, but I too much gentlemans to ask them take off onefarding.  I challenge you--I challenge you.'  I then said, `Hold yourtongue, sir; take your money and be off.'  `Me take money!' replied he;`me take money!  No, my servant take money; I too much gentlemans totake money.'  Upon which the waiter swept the cash off the table, handedit to his master, who immediately sacked it and walked off."I certainly have myself come to the conclusion that the idea of goingabroad for economy is most erroneous.  As I have before observed, theonly article, except education, which is cheaper, is wine; and I amafraid, considering the thirsty propensities of my countrymen, that is avery strong attraction with the nobler sex.  If claret and all otherFrench wines were admitted into England at a much lower duty, they wouldbe almost as cheap in England as they are in foreign capitals; and, asthe increased consumption would more than indemnify the government, itis to be lamented that it is not so arranged.--Formerly we shut out theFrench wines, and admitted those of Portugal, as our ancient ally; butour ancient ally has shown any thing but good-will towards us lately,and we are at all events under no further obligation to support herinterests.  Let us admit French wines in bottles at a very low duty, andthen England will be in every respect as cheap, and infinitely morecomfortable as a residence than any part of the Continent.  Theabsentees who are worth reclaiming will return; those who prefer toremain on the Continent are much better there than if they werecontaminating their countrymen with their presence.  How true is thefollowing observation from the author I before quoted on her return fromabroad:--"Home, home at last.  How clean, how cheerful, how comfortable!  I wasshown at Marthien the shabby, dirty-looking lodgings where the -- areeconomising, in penance for the pleasure of one little year spent inthis charming house!  Poor people!  How they must long for England! howthey must miss the thousand trivial but essential conveniences devisedhere for the civilisation of human life!  What an air of decency andrespectfulness about the servants! what a feeling of homeishness in ahouse exclusively our own!  The modes of life may be easier on theContinent,--but it is the ease of a beggar's ragged coat which hasserved twenty masters, and is twitched off and on till it scarcely holdstogether, in comparison with the decent, close-fitting suitcharacteristic of a gentleman."CHAPTER THIRTY.                                                               Brussels.Authors, like doctors, are very apt to disagree.  Reading, the otherday, a very amusing publication, called the "Diary of a Desennuyee,"some passages in it induced me to fall back upon Henry Bulwer's work onFrance.  Among his remarks upon literary influence in that country, hehas the following:--"A literary Frenchman, whom I met not long ago in Paris, said to me thata good-natured young English nobleman, whom I will not name, had toldhim that dancers and singers were perfectly well received in Englishsociety, but not men of letters."`Est il possible qu'on soit si barbare chez vous?'"He subsequently adds:--"To be known as a writer is certainly to yourprejudice."First, people presume you are not what they call a gentleman; and thegrandfather who, if you were a banker or a butcher, or of any othercalling or profession, would be left quiet in his tomb, is evokedagainst you."Mr Bulwer then proceeds with a variety of argument to prove thatliterary men are not _Maecenased_ by either the government oraristocracy of Great Britain.  He points out the advantages which theFrench literati have from their Institute, the ennoblements, thedecorations, and pensions which they receive; and certainly makes out astrong case.The author of the "Diary" would attempt to deny the statements of MrBulwer; but, in the very denial, she admits all his points but one--towit that they are not so well received by the aristocracy in England asthey are in France.She says--"What does Henry Bulwer mean by the assertion that literary men are moreeagerly welcomed in society here than in England?"They occupy, perhaps, a more independent and honourable position, areless exposed to being lionised by patronising dowagers, and more sure ofobtaining public preferment; but, with the exception of Mignet andMerimee--who are courted for their personal merits and official standingrather than for their literary distinctions--I have scarcely met one ofthem.  To the parties of the ministers of the _Grand Referendaire_, andother public functionaries, artists and men of letters are admitted aspart of a political system; but they are not to be found--like Moore,Rogers, Chantrey, Newton, and others--in the boudoirs of the _elite_, orthe select fetes of a Devonshire House."The calling of `_un homme de lettres_' is here, however, a professionbearing its own rewards and profits, and forming an especial andindependent class.  In common with the artists they look to ennoblementin the Academy, and under the existing order of things have been richlyendowed with places and pensions."It appears then, in France, that to the parties of ministers, etcetera,they are admitted as a part of the political system; and further, thatthey have been festered by the government, by being ennobled and richlyendowed with places and pensions.  Therefore, upon his opponent's ownshowing, Henry Bulwer has made out his case.  In another part of thesame work there is the following amusing passage, in advice given by alady of fashion to her protegee upon entering into London society."`Pore over their books as much as you please, but do not so much as dipinto the authors,' said she, when I proposed an introduction to one ofthe most popular authors of the day.  `These people expend their spiriton their works--the part that walks through society is a mere lump ofclay, like the refuse of the wine-press after the wine has beenexpressed.'  In conversing with a clever author you sometimes see a newidea brighten his eye or create a smile round his lip; but for worlds hewould not give it utterance.  It belongs to his next work, and isinstantly booked in the ledger of his daily thoughts, value 3 shillings6 pence.  The man's mind is his mine; he can't afford to work it gratis,or give away the produce."If we are to draw any inference from this extract, it is, that althoughsome noblemen do extend their patronage to literary men, at all eventsthe general feeling is against them.  I must say that I never was moreamused than when I read the above sarcasm.  There is much truth in it,and yet it is not true.  In future when I _do_ say good things, as theycall them, in company, I shall know precise value of myexpenditure during the dinner or evening party by reckoning up thethree-and-sixpences.  One thing is clear, that if an author say half adozen good things, he fully pays for his dinner.In the "Student," Edward Bulwer makes some remarks which range inopposition to the author of the above "Diary."  In arguing that mostauthors may be known by their works, he says--"Authors are the only men we really do know; the rest of mankind diewith only the surface of their character understood."It appears, then, that people have no excuse for being disappointed inauthors; when they meet them in company they have but to read theirworks, and if they like the works they must live the authors.  Before Iproceed I must be permitted to make a remark here.  An author's opiniongiven as his own will allow the public to have an insight into hischaracter and feelings, and the public are justified in forming theiropinions of an author upon such grounds.  But it too often happens thatthe public will form their opinion of an author from opinions put by himinto the mouths of the characters drawn in a work of fiction, forgettingthat in these instances it is not the author who speaks, but theindividuals which his imagination has conjured up; and that the opinionsexpressed by these creatures of his brain, although perfectly in keepingwith the character, and necessary to produce that _vraisemblance_ whichis the great merit of fiction, may be entirely opposed to the realsentiments of the author.  The true merit of fiction, and that which isessential to its success, is the power of the author at the time that heis writing to divest himself, as it were, of himself, and be for thetime the essence of the character which he is delineating.  It istherefore a great injustice to an author to accuse him of being aninfidel because his infidel character is well portrayed, particularlyas, if he is equally fortunate in describing a character which isperfect, the public do not ever give him the credit for similarperfection.  That is quite another affair.  Again, Edward Bulwer says,in opposition to the poverty of the _mine_:--"A man is, I suspect, but of a second-rate order whose genius is notimmeasurably above his works,--who does not feel within him aninexhaustible affluence of thoughts, feelings, and invention, which henever will have leisure to embody in print.  He will die and leave onlya thousandth part of his wealth to posterity, which is his heir."I like to bring all in juxtaposition.  There is excitement in makingmischief, and that is the reason why people are so fond of it.  Still,the question at issue ought to be fairly decided; and, as in case ofarbitration, when the disputants cannot agree, a third party is calledin by mutual consent, I shall venture to take upon myself that office,and will fairly argue the point, as there is more dependent upon itthan, upon the first view, the question may appear to merit.If we turn back to the last century, in what position shall we findauthors?--looking up to patrons among the aristocracy, and dedicatingtheir works to them in panegyrics, fulsome from their obsequiousness andflattery.  At that period the aristocracy and the people were much widerapart than they are at present.Gradually the people have advanced; and, as they have advanced, so havethe authors thrown off the trammels of servitude, and have attacked thevices and follies as well as the privileges of those to whom they oncebowed the knee.The advancement of the people, and the lowering of the aristocracy, haveboth been effected through the medium of the press.  The position ofauthors has been much altered.  Formerly we behold such men as Dryden,Otway, and many others (giants in their days), humbling themselves forbread.  Now we have seldom a dedication, and of those few we have theflattery is delicate.  The authors look to the public as their patrons,and the aristocracy are considered but as a part and portion of it.These remarks equally hold good with respect to the government.  Authorsare not to be so easily purchased as formerly; they prefer writing inconformity with public opinion to writing for government, because theyare better remunerated.  Now, if it will be recalled to mind that in therapid march of the people, in their assertion of their right to agreater share in the government of the country, in the pointing out andcorrecting of abuses, and in the breaking down of all the defences whichhave gradually yielded in so many years, it is the authors and the presswho have led the van, and that in these continual inroads thearistocracy have been the party attacked,--it is no wonder that therehas arisen, unwittingly perhaps on the part of the aristocracy, afeeling against the press and against authors in general.The press has been, and will probably for a long while continue to be,the enemy of the aristocracy; and it is hardly reasonable to expect thatthe aristocracy should admit the enemy within its camp.  For, be itobserved, whether a man write a political pamphlet or a novel, he hasstill the same opportunity of expressing his sentiments, of flatteringthe public by espousing their opinions; and as a writer of fiction,perhaps, his opinions have more effect that as a pamphleteer.  In thefirst instance, you are prepared to expect a political partisan; in thelatter, you read for amusement, and unconsciously receive the bias.  Forone who reads a political pamphlet (by-the-by, they are generally onlyread by those who are of the same way of thinking as the author) thereare hundreds who read through a work of fiction, so that the opinions ofthe latter are much more widely disseminated.  Now, as most works arewritten for profit as well as reputation, they are naturally so wordedas to insure the good-will of the majority, otherwise they would nothave so extensive a sale.  The majority being decidedly liberal, everywork that now appears more or less attacks the higher orders.  When,therefore, a gentleman who has been well received in the best societyventures upon writing a work, it is quite sufficient to state that he isan author (without his book being read) to occasion him to "_losecaste_" to a certain degree.  Authors have been the enemies of thehigher classes.  You have become an author--consequently you have rankedyourself with our enemies.  Henry Bulwer, therefore, is right where heasserts that "to be known as an author is to your prejudice among thehigher classes."Having made these observations to point out that the aristocracy and thepress are at variance, let us now examine into the merits of authors, asmixing in society.  And here I think it will be proved that it is moretheir misfortune than their fault that there should be a prejudiceagainst them.  They are overrated before they are seen, and underratedafterwards.You read the works of an author--you are pleased with them, and you wishto become acquainted with the man.  You anticipate great pleasure--youexpect from his lips, in _impromptu_, the same racy remarks, the samechain of reasoning, the same life and vigour which have cost him so manyhours of labour and reflection, or which have been elicited in hishappiest moods, and this from a person who comes, perhaps, almost atotal stranger into a large company.  Is this fair or just to him?  Didyou find any of your other friends, at first meeting, play the fiddle toa whole company of strangers?  Are not authors as reserved and shy asother people--even more so?  And yet you ask them, as if they weremountebanks or jugglers with a certain set of tricks, to amuse thecompany.  The very circumstance of being aware that this is expected ofhim makes the man silent, and his very anxiety to come up to yourexpectations takes away from his power.The consequence is, that you are disappointed, and so are the company,to whom you have announced that "Mr So-and-So" is to meet them.  Hadyou become intimate with this person you would perhaps have found thedifference, and that he whom you pronounced as so great a failure, wouldhave turned out equally amusing.  At the same time there is some truthin the remarks of the "Desennuyee" that "some authors will not let outtheir new ideas, because they require them for their books."  But, asBulwer observes, they must be but second-raters, as the majority ofauthors are.In many instances they are punsters; but punning is not a standard ofauthorship; or, perhaps, there may be other second-rate authors present,and if so, they know that they are in the company of literarypickpockets.To prove that this remark of the "Desennuyee" can only apply tosecond-rate authors, let us examine into the conversational powers ofthose who are first-rate.  And here I can only speak of those whom Ihave known--there may be many others.  Where could you find suchconversationists as Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Sir John Malcolm, and manyothers, who are now gone?  And among those in existence, I have but tomention Croker, Theodore Hooke, Professor Wilson, Bulwer, Lockhart, theSmiths, and, in the other sex, Lady Blessington, Lady Morgan, MesdamesSomerville, Austin, and Jameson.Now these are all first-rate authors in their various styles; and I canchallenge any one to bring forward an equal number out of the whole masswho are so powerful or delightful in society.  And there is still moreto be said in favour of authors.  I know many whose conversation issuperior to their writings; I will not name them as they, perhaps, wouldnot consider this to be a compliment but it fully tends to disprove theremarks of the "Desennuyee" as to authors of talent reserving theirthoughts for their hooks, for, on the _contrary_, when in company, theygenerally take the lead.  Still, there is a difference arising from thevariety of temperament: some, accustomed to mix constantly in society,will be indifferent whether they are acquainted with the parties presentor not; others, more retiring, require to feel at their ease, and it isonly in small coteries, and among friends, that their real value can beappreciated.  Theodore Hooke is a proof of the former, the late CharlesLamb was of the latter.  Some shine most when they have no competitors;others are only to be brought out when other men of talent are incompany, and, like the flint and steel, their sparks are only to beproduced by collision.If I might be permitted to offer an opinion to the authors themselves,it would be, not to mix in general company, but confine themselves totheir own friends.  They would stand much higher in reputation if theyadhered to this plan; above all, let them avoid what the author of the"Desennuyee" terms those "Skinnerian lion feeds" given by those who haveno talent to appreciate, and who, to fill their menagerie, will mix youup with foreign swindlers, and home-bred ruffians.  This is mosthumiliating and has certainly injured the fraternity.I have but one more remark to make.  Authors in England have little toexpect from the Government and the aristocracy.  Pensions and honourshave been given, but until Sir Robert Peel set a more worthy example,they were bestowed for the support of political opinions, not as areward of talent.  That the aristocracy, with but a few exceptions, havenot fostered talent, is most true; and they are now suffering from theirwant of judgment.  They have shut their doors to authors, and theauthors have been gradually undermining their power.  To what extentthis may be carried, it is impossible to say; but one thing is certain,that the press is more powerful than either king or lords, and that, ifthe conflict continue, the latter must yield to the influence of theformer, who will have ample retaliation for the neglect to which theyhave been subjected.What a superiority there is in England over France, and every othernation, in the periodical and daily press, especially in the latter!Take up the "Constitutionnel," or "Journal des Debats" at Paris, andthen look at the broad double sheets of the "Times" and other morningpapers, with the columns of information and original matter which theycontain.  Compare the flimsy sheets, bad printing, and general paucityof information of the continental daily press, with the clear types,rapid steam power called into action, the outlay, enormous expenditure,and rapid information obtained by our leading journals from all quartersof the globe.  I have looked with astonishment and admiration at theworking of the "Times" newspaper by its beautiful steam-engine; it isone of the most interesting sights that can be beheld.Nothing but the assistance of steam could, indeed, enable the greatdaily newspapers to accomplish their present task.  When the readercalls to mind that the debates in the House are sometimes kept up tilltwo or three o'clock in the morning; that the reporters, relieved everytwenty minutes, have to carry all their communications to the office;that all this matter has to be arranged, put in type, and then workedoff; and that, notwithstanding this, the double sheet of matter is onthousands and thousands of tables by nine o'clock the next morning, itis really wonderful how it can be accomplished.  Saturday night appearsto be the only night on which those connected with these immense,undertakings can be said to have any repose from year's end to year'send.  What a life of toil what an unnatural life must theirs be, whothus cater during the hours of darkness for the information andamusement of the mass who have slept soundly through the night, and riseto be instructed by the labour of their vigils!  It can be effected inno other country in the world.  It is another link in the great chain ofmiracles, which proves the greatness of England.The editors of these papers must have a most onerous task.  It is notthe writing of the leading article itself, but the obligation to writethat article every day, whether inclined or not, in sickness or inhealth, in affliction, distress of mind, winter and summer, year afteryear, tied down to one task, remaining in one spot.  It is somethinglike the walking a thousand miles in a thousand hours.  I have afellow-feeling for them, for I know how a monthly periodical will weardown one's existence.  In itself it appears nothing--the labour is notmanifest nor is it the labour--it is the continual attention which itrequires.  Your life becomes as it were the magazine.  One month is nosooner corrected and printed than on comes the other.  It is the stoneof Sisyphus--an endless repetition of toil--a constant weight upon themind--a continual wearing upon the intellect and spirits, demanding allthe exertion of your faculties, at the same time that you are compelledto do the severest drudgery.  To write for a magazine is very well, butto edit one is to condemn yourself to slavery.Magazine writing, as it is generally termed, is the most difficult ofall writing, and but few succeed in it; the reason of which is obvious--it must always be what is termed "up to the mark."Any one who publishes a work in one, two, or three volumes, may bepermitted to introduce a dull chapter or two: no one remarks it; indeed,these dull chapters allow the mind of the reader to relax for the time,and, strange to say, are sometimes favourable to the author.  But inmagazine-writing these cannot be permitted; the reader requiresexcitement, and whether the article be political or fictitious, thererequires a condensation of matter, a pithiness of expression (to enableyou to tell your story in so small a space), which is very difficult toobtain.  Even in continuations the same rule must be adhered to, for,being read month after month, each separate portion must be consideredas a whole and independents of the other; it must not therefore flag forone minute.  A proof of this was given in that very remarkableproduction in "Blackwood's Magazine," styled "Tom Cringle's Log."  Everyseparate portion was devoured by the public--they waited impatiently forthe first of the month that they might read the continuation, and everyone was delighted, oven to its close, because the excitement was sopowerful.  Some time afterwards the work was published in two volumes,and then, what was the consequence?--people complained that it wasovercharged--that it was too full of excitement--gave no repose.  Thiswas true; when collected together it had that fault--a very good one, bythe by, as well as a very uncommon one; but they did not perceive thatuntil it was all published together.  During the time that it came outin fragments they were delighted.  Although, in this instance, thewriting was overcharged, still it proved, from the popularity itobtained when it appeared in the magazine, what force and condensationof matter is required in writing for periodicals.CHAPTER THIRTY ONE.I am grave to-day; it is the birth-day of one of my children--a day sojoyful in youth, in more advanced life so teeming with thought andserious reflections.  How happy the child is--and it is its happinesswhich has made me grave.How changed are our feelings as we advance in life!--Our responsibilityis increased with each fleeting year.  In youth we live but forourselves--self predominates in every thing.  In mature age, if we havefulfilled the conditions of our tenure, we feel that we must live forour children.  Fortunately, increase of years weans us from thoseselfish and frivolous expenses which youth requires, and we feel itlittle or no sacrifice to devote to our children the means which,before, we considered so important to the gratification of our pride andour ambition.  Not that we have lost either our pride or our ambition,but they have become centred in other objects dearer to us thanourselves--in the race springing up--to whom we shall leave our namesand worldly possessions when our own career is closed.Worn out with the pursuit of vanity, we pause at a certain age, and cometo the conclusion that in this life we require but little else than toeat, drink, prepare for a future existence, and to die.What a miserable being must an old bachelor be!--he vegetates, but hecannot be said to exist--he passes his life in one long career ofselfishness, and dies.  Strange, that children, and the responsibilityattached to their welfare, should do more to bring a man into the rightpath than any denunciations from holy writ or holy men!  How many whomight have been lost, have been, it is to be hoped, saved, from thefeeling that they must leave their children a good name, and mustprovide for their support and advancement in life!  Yes, and how manywomen, after a life so frivolous as to amount to wickedness, have, fromtheir attachment to their offspring, settled down into the redeemingposition of careful, anxious, and serious-minded mothers!Such reflections will rise upon a birth-day, and many more of chequeredhopes and fears.  How long will these flowers, now blossoming so fairly,be permitted to remain with us?  Will they be mowed down before anotherbirth-day, or will they be permitted to live to pass through the ordealof this life of temptation?  How will they combat?  Will they fall anddisgrace their parents, or will they be a pride and blessing?  Will itplease Heaven to allow them to be not too much tempted, not overcome bysickness, or that they shall be severely chastised?  Those germs ofvirtue now appearing, those tares now growing up with the corn--will thefruit bring forth good seed? will the latter be effectually rooted up byprecept and example?  How much to encourage! and how much to check!Virtues in excess are turned to vice--liberality becomes extravagance--prudence, avarice--courage, rashness--love, weakness--even religion mayturn to fanaticism--and superior intellect may, in its daring, mock thepower which granted it.  Alas! what a responsibility is here.  A man mayenjoy or suffer when he lives for himself alone; but he is doubly blestor doubly cursed when, in his second stage, he is visited through hischildren.  What a blessing is our ignorance of the future!  Fatal,indeed, to all happiness in this world would be a foreknowledge of thatwhich is to come.  We have but to do our duty and hope for the best,acknowledging, however severe may be the dispensation, that whatever is,or is to be, is right.How strange, although we feel in the midst of life we are in death, thatmortals should presume to reduce it to a nice calculation, and speculateupon it!  I can sell my life now to an annuity-office for twenty years'purchase or more, and they will share a dividend upon it.  Well, if everI do insure my life, I hope that by _me_ they will lose money, for, likeevery body else in this world, I have a great many things to do before Idie.  There was but one man I ever heard of who could lie down and die,saying, "Now, Lord, let thy servant depart in peace."  I have no warningyet, no screw is loose in this complex mechanism; and yet, this veryday, a chimney-pot may fall on my head, and put an end to all mycalculations.It is right that the precarious tenure of our existence should not bewholly forgotten, but certainly was never intended that it should beborne on the mind, for, if we had ever in our memory that we may diethis very hour, what a check there would be to all energy, andenterprise, and industry.  Who would speculate with the anticipation oflarge returns upon some future day, if he did not calculate upon livingto receive them?  We should all stop to say _Cui bono_?  If it were notthat our hopes support us, not only support us in all reasonable, buteven unreasonable calculations, the world would be at a stand-still.No, no! we have our duty to perform towards our God; but we are alsoenjoined to perform our duty towards our neighbour.  The uncertainty oflife is to be remembered as a check to our worldly passions, but not asa drag-chain to our worldly career.CHAPTER THIRTY TWO.                                                 En route, August, 1837.There is a great art in packing property, and in it our profession arefortunately adepts.  A midshipman, for instance, contrives to put everything at the bottom of his chest.  No very easy matter to pack up andarrange a carriage full of children, two birds, and a spaniel puppy--inall, twelve living beings with all their appendages, down to the birdsand dogs' tails.  As for packing up a dog, that is impossible; the bestway is to pack it off.  Canary birds travel very well in the carriagelamps, in the summer time, when they are not lighted; and I mention thisas a hint to those who travel with such indispensable appendages;independent of their being out of the way, their appearance behind theglass is a source of great amusement to those who are standing by whereyou change horses.Stopped at Saint Frond, and asked what was to be seen.  Nothing here butchurches and monks.  One of the little girls, three years old, lookedwith avidity at the Virgin Mary, three feet high, in gold brocade.  Theold verger observing this, led her nearer to it, ascribing heradmiration probably to piety, when, to his horror, she screamed out,"_Quel jolie poupee_!"  Solomon says, "Out of the mouths of babes shallye be taught wisdom."  The old man dropped her hand, and looked as if hewould have lighted the faggots had she been bound to the stake, as she,in his opinion, deserved.The perseverance of Belgian beggars is most remarkable, and equallyannoying.  The best way is to take out your purse, and pretend to throwsomething over their heads; they turn back to look for it; and if youkeep pointing farther off, you distance them.  On the whole, I considerthat it is much more advisable not to give to beggars, than to relievethem.  Begging is demoralising, and should be discountenanced in everycountry.  If children are brought up to whine, cry, and humiliatethemselves as in Belgium, that feeling of pride and independence inearly youth, which leads to industry in after life, is destroyed.  Andyet, the aged and infirm would appear to be proper objects of charity.In many cases, of course, they must be; but to prove how you may bedeceived, I will state a circumstance which occurred to me some yearsago.I was driving up the road with a friend.  He was one of the pleasantestand most honest men that nature ever moulded.  His death was mostextraordinary: of a nervous temperament, ill health ended in aberrationof intellect.  At that time Lord Castlereagh had ended his life ofover-excitement by suicide; the details in the newspapers were read byhim, and he fancied that he was Lord Castlereagh.  Acting precisely bythe accounts recorded in the newspapers, he went through the same forms,and actually divided his carotid artery, using his penknife, as had donethe unfortunate peer.  Peace be with him!  To proceed.  I was driving ina gig, a distance of about forty miles from town, on the Northern Road,when, at the bottom of a steep hill, we fell in with a group who werewalking up it.  It consisted of a venerable old man, with his grey locksfalling down on his shoulders, dressed as a countryman, with a bundle ona stick over his shoulders; with him were a young man and woman, bothheavily burdened, and five children of different sizes.  The appearanceof the old man was really patriarchal, and there was a placidity in hiscountenance which gave a very favourable impression.  For a short timethey continued breasting the hill on the pathway: when about one-thirdup, the old man crossed the road to us, as our horse was walking up, andtaking off his hat, said, "Gentlemen, if not too great a liberty, may Iask how far it is to --?" mentioning a town about twelve miles off.  Wetold him, and he replied, "That's a long way for old legs like mine, andyoung legs of tired children."  He then informed us that they had losttheir employment in the country, and that, with his son and daughter,and their children, he had gone to town to procure work, but had beenunsuccessful, and they were now on their return.  "God's will be done!"continued he, after his narrative, "and thankful shall we be to findourselves at our cottages again, although twelve miles is a weary bit ofroad, and I have but a few halfpence left; but that will buy a bit ofbread for the poor children, and we must do as we can.  Good morning,and thank'ye kindly, gentlemen."Now there was no begging here, certainly, except by implication.  Theeffect, however, of his narrative was to extract a crown out of ourpockets, which was received with a shower of blessings on our heads.  Wedrove off, observing how difficult it was to know how to select realobjects of charity, and flattering ourselves that alms in this instancewere worthily bestowed.  My readers will agree with me, I have no doubt.It so happened that, about ten days afterwards, I was driving on theDover Road, in the same gig, and in company with the same gentleman,when we came to the bottom of Shooters Hill.  Who should we fall in withbut the very same party, the venerable old man, the young people, andthe children trudging up the pathway.  The same plan of proceeding wasobserved, for, although we recognised them immediately it appeared thatthey did not recognise us.  We allowed the old fellow to tell his tale,as before; it was just the same.  He first took off his hat, andinquired the distance to --; and then entered into the same narrative,only changing the place of abode, and ending with his few halfpence tobuy bread for the children.  I let him finish, and then I did not, asbefore, give him a crown, but I gave him a cut across his face with thewhip, which made him drop his bundle, put his hands up to it; and weleft him, stamping with pain in the middle of the road, till we were outof sight.  A young rogue I can easily pardon, but an old one, on theverge of the grave, is a proof of hardened villainy, which admits of noextenuation.  After giving him this _cut direct_, we never met again.To return to Saint Frond.--In the last church we visited we had a scene.A woman was in the confessional; the priest, with a white handkerchiefup to conceal his face, and prevent what he said being overheard,attracted the attention of the children, who demanded an explanation.Children ask so many questions.  "Do you think she has been very wicked?Will he forgive her?"  Before I could offer my opinion upon thisimportant subject, the woman gave a loud scream, and fell back from theconfessional in a fit.  The priest rose, the handkerchief no longerconcealed his face, and he appeared to be burning with indignation.  Shewas carried out of the church, and the priest hastened up the aisle tothe vestry.  What had she done?  At all events, something for which itappeared there was no absolution.Aix-la-Chapelle--alas!  What did we care for the tomb of Charles theGreat, and his extensive dominions, his splendour and power?  We hadlost something to us of much more importance--a carpet bag; not that thecarpet bag was of much value, for it was an old one, nor the articleswhich it contained, for they were neither new nor of much worth; but welost in that carpet bag an invaluable quantity of comfort, for itcontained a variety of little absolute necessaries, the loss of which wecould not replace until our arrival at Cologne, to which town all ourtrunks had been despatched.  The children could not be brushed, for thebrushes were in the carpet bag; they could not be combed, for the combswere in the carpet bag; they were put to bed without nightcaps, for thenight-caps were in the carpet bag; they were put to bed in their littlechemises, reaching down to the fifth rib or thereabouts, for theirnight-clothes were in the carpet bag: not only the children, but everyone else suffered by this carpet bag being absent without leave.  Myboots burst, and my others were in the carpet bag; my snuff-box wasempty, and the canister was in the carpet bag; and the servantsgrumbled, for they had smuggled some of their things into the carpetbag.It would appear that everything had been crammed into this unfortunatereceptacle.  Had we lost a jewel-case, or a purse full of money, itwould have been a trifle compared to the misery occasioned by thisjumble up of every day conveniences of little value, showing how muchmore comfort depends upon the necessaries than the luxuries of life.  Imay add, now that I read what I have written, that this carpet bagincreased in dimensions to a most extraordinary compass for severalweeks afterwards.  Everything that was missing was declared by theservants to have been in the carpet bag, which, like the scape-goat ofthe Jews, wandered in the wilderness, bearing with it all the sins ofall the nurses and every other domestic of the family.On our road, the landlord of an inn put the following printed documentinto my hands, which I make public for the benefit of those who aresportsmen without being landholders.  "COMFORTABLE INN.--The proprietor of the Red House, at Burgheim, on  the road from Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne, pleasantly situated in the  middle of the town, opposite the Post-Office and Post-House, has the  honour of recommending himself to travellers.  The `Galignani's  Messenger' and other newspapers are taken in.  The English, German,  and French languages spoken.  Having excellent preserves of game in  the neighbourhood, he is happy to inform travellers that he can  provide them with good sports in wild boar, deer, and hare hunting,  and wild duck and partridge shooting.  Horses and carriages of all  descriptions supplied for excursions in the neighbourhood.  "AJ HONS."_Prussia_.--I fear that our political economists are running after ashadow, and that their reciprocity system will never be listened to.  Itis remarkable, that, after subsidising this and other powers to break upthe continental system established by Napoleon for the expulsion ofEnglish manufactures and the consequent ruin of England, now that theworld is at peace, these very powers who, by our exertions and ourmoney, have been liberated from their thraldom, have themselvesestablished the very system of exclusion which we were so anxious toprevent.  A little reflection will prove that they are right.  Thegovernment of a country ought never, if possible, to allow that countryto be dependent upon any other for such resources as it can obtain byits own industry.  We, ourselves, acted upon this principle when weestablished the silk manufactories in Spitalfields; and it is the dutyof every government to do the same.The indigenous productions of the soil may fairly be admitted on asystem of reciprocity and exchange, but not articles of manufacture, ofwhich the raw material is to be obtained by all.  For instance, thelead, and iron, and tin of Great Britain, the wines of other countries,are all articles to be exchanged or paid for by those who have not minesof those metals, or do not possess vineyards.  Further than thisreciprocity cannot go, without being injurious to one, if not to bothparties.Three of the carriage-wheels defective!  Add this to the carpet bag, andpeople will agree in the trite observation that misfortunes never comesingle.  This is not true; they do come single very often, and when theydo, they are more annoying than if they come in heaps.  You growl at asingle mishap, but if you find that Fortune is down upon you andattempts to overload you, you rise up against her with indignation, snapyour fingers, and laugh at her.  The last mishap brought consolation forall the others; if we had not so fortunately found out the defects inthe wheels, we might have broken our necks the next day, especially, assome amateur took a fancy and helped himself to our _sabot_.  I onlywish he may be shod with it for the remainder of his days.It is curious how the ignorant and simple always rise or depreciateothers, whatever their rank may be, to their own levels, when they talkof them.  I listened to one little girl telling a story to another, inwhich kings, queens, and princesses were the actors."And so," said the queen to the princess, "what a very pretty doll thatis of yours!""Yes, your majesty; papa bought it for me at the bazaar, and gave 5shillings 6 pence for it," etcetera.This reminded me of the sailors telling stories on board of aman-of-war, who put very different language into the mouth of royalty."Well," says the king, "blow me tight if I'll stand this.  You mustbuckle-to as fast as you please, Mrs Queen.""I'll see you hanged first, and your head shaved too," answered hermajesty in a rage, etcetera, etcetera.  What queens may say in a rage itis impossible to assert; but to the seamen this language appeared to beperfectly regal and quite correct.Some people form odd notions of gentility.  A cabman took up awell-dressed female, who made use of expressions which rather startledhim, and he observed to a friend of his, a hackney-coachman, that he hadno idea that the higher classes used such language."Pooh! pooh!" replied the coachman, "she warn't a lady.""I beg your pardon," replied the cabman, "a real lady, _hat andfeathers_!"Cologne.--This is a regular Golgotha--the skulls of the Magi, _parexcellence_, and then the skulls of Saint Ursula and her 11,000 virgins.I wonder where she collected so many!  Saint Ursula brought a greatforce into the field, at all events, and, I presume, commands the rightwing of the whole army of martyrs.  I went into the golden chamber,where there are some really pretty things.  The old fellow handed us thearticles one after another, but I observed that there were many thingswhich I had seen when here before, which were not presented to view, soI looked into the cabinet and found them.  They were crystal vases,mounted with gold and precious stones.  One had the thigh-bone of SaintSebastian; another, part of the ulna of Saint Lawrence; and a third abit of the petticoat of the Virgin Mary.  I handed them out to theladies, and asked him why he did not show us those as he used to dobefore.  The old man smiled and turned the corners of his mouth down, asif to say, "Its all humbug!"  Relics are certainly at a discount, evenamong the Catholics.I question whether the Bridge of Boats at Cologne don't pay better thanany other in the whole world, although by no means the handsomest; thestream of passengers on it all day is as strong and as wide as the Rhineitself.  As for Cologne, the best thing that could happen to it is to beburnt down.  Narrow streets, badly ventilated, badly drained; your noseis visited with a thousand varieties of smell as you pass along; and theEau de Cologne in the gutters is very different in savour from thatwhich you buy in the bottles.We had a pleasant passage from Cologne to Coblentz, and from thence toMayence, because we had pleasant company.  It is singular, but it is afact, that you go on board a steamboat to avoid fatigue, and each nightyou are more tired than if you had travelled by land.  You go to avoiddust and heat; the first is exchanged for blacks out of the funnel, andyou are more dirty than if you had travelled twice the distance; and theheat is about the same; in these points you certainly gain nothing.  Theexpense of these Rhine steamboats is very great.  By a calculation Imade--to travel by post, five persons in a carriage, from Cologne toStrasburg--you will expend 200 and odd francs less than by the steamconveyance.  In time you certainly lose by steam, as you are four daysand a half going to Strasburg, and by land carriage it is half thedistance, being only forty-five posts.Neither do you save trouble; for the steam-boats being changed everyevening, you have to take your luggage on shore, shift it from one tothe other, and, at the very time that you are least inclined to doanything, independent of an enormous expense which you ought not to pay,but cannot well resist.Now, as you really gain nothing in the above points, it is at least tobe supposed that you gain in the picturesque; but this is not the case:and I have no hesitation in asserting that those who go up the Rhine aregenerally disappointed, although they do not like to say so.  Theyexpect too much.--The vivid descriptions, the steel engravings, haveraised their anticipations too high; and they find that the reality isnot equal to the efforts of the pen and pencil.  Several of thepassengers acknowledged to me that they were disappointed; and I mustconfess that I hardly knew the Rhine again.  When I travelled up theRhine by land I thought it beautiful; but in a steam-boat it was tame.This was observed by others, besides myself, who had ascended both bysteam and by the road running close to the banks; and the reason wassimple.  When you travel by land you have the whole breadth of the Rhineas a foreground to the scenery of the opposite bank, and this you loseby water; and the bank you travel on is much more grand from itstowering above you, and also from the sharp angles and turns which sosuddenly change the scenery.  Abruptness greatly assists thepicturesque: the Rhine loses half its beauty viewed from a steam-boat.I have ascended it in both ways, and I should recommend all travellersto go up by land.  The inconveniences in a steam-boat are many.  Youarrive late and find the hotel crowded, and you are forced to rise veryearly (as Mayence at three o'clock in the morning), which, with afamily, is no trifle.  The only part of the Rhine worth seeing is fromCologne to Mayence; below Cologne and above Mayence it is withoutinterest; and although between these two places the steam-boats are wellserved, above Mayence everything is very uncomfortable, and you areliable to every species of exaction.If I were to plan a tour up the Rhine for any friends, I should advisethem not to go by the Rotterdam steamer; it is a long voyage and withoutinterest, and with many inconveniences; but start in the steamer toAntwerp, go up to Brussels by the rail-road; from thence you will startfor Cologne by the route of Namur and Liege through Waterloo; and Irather expect that many will prefer the banks of the _Meuse_ to theRhine.  I know nothing more beautiful than the road from Namur as far asChaude Fontaine, although compared to the Rhine it is on a miniaturescale.  From Liege to Aix-la-Chapelle, and from thence to Cologne.  Goup the Rhine by land as far as Mayence, and then you may do as youplease.  When you are coming back, descend by the steam-boats; for thenyou go with the stream and with great rapidity, and arrive in good timeat the towns where they stop.  You will then have seen the Rhine by landand by water.At present the bubble is at its height; but it will burst by-and-by.The English are lining the banks of the Rhine with gold, and receiveinsult and abuse in exchange.  I have been much amused with a youngcountryman who has come up in the steamer with me.  Not able to speak aword of French or German, he is pillaged every hour of the day; but ifhe could speak, he has no idea of the value of his money.  He pulls outhis purse, and the waiters help themselves--very _plentifully_, I maysafely add.  What he has come for it is difficult to say: not for thepicturesque, for he slept the whole time between Cologne and Mayence--that is, all the time that was not occupied by eating and drinking.  Hisonly object appears to be to try the Rhenish wines.  He has tried allupon the _Wein Presen_.  He called for a bottle of the best; they gavehim one not on the _carte_, and charged him exactly one pound sterlingfor the bottle.  He is a generous fellow; he sits at the table with hisbottle before him, and invites every man to partake of it.  And he foundplenty on board who were willing to oblige him."Capital wine, an't it?" said he to a Frenchman who drank his wine, butdid not understand a word of English."A votre sante, Monsieur," replied the Frenchman."I say, what wine do you call it?""C'est exquis, Monsieur," replied the Frenchman."Eskey, is it?  You, waiter, bring us another bottle of eskey."CHAPTER THIRTY THREE.To continue.--Should travellers think it advisable to proceed upon theRhine, so far as Mayence, let them be careful how they venture toproceed farther.  I did so, out of curiosity to know what the featuresof the Rhine were, after it had lost its character for magnificence; andI will now detail my progress.  At Mayence you are shifted into asmaller steamer, with less power, upon the principle that there beingbut a few passengers, their comforts do not require so much attention;for, as the Rhine becomes more rapid as it narrows, upon any otherprinciple the power of the engine should have been greater.  I mustcaution the reader not to believe what is told them by the steam-packetcompany.Barbers were once considered liars _par excellence_, but I am inclinedto give the preference to these new associations.  The features of theRhine change immediately that you leave Mayence; the banks are low, andthe river is studded with numerous islands, all of which, as well as thegreatest proportion of the banks, are covered with osiers.  Still, thereis a great beauty in the Rhine even there; the waving of the osiers tothe strong breeze, the rapidity of the current, the windings of theriver, the picturesque spires of the village churches, or the change ofscenery when the river pours through forests, lining each bank as thevessel slowly claws against the rapid stream, are by no meansuninteresting; of course we did not arrive at Leopoldshaffen at the hourstated by the people at the office, but we did arrive late at night, andtook up our quarters at a small auberge in the above village, which isnot marked down in the maps, but which has post-horses and diligences toconvey passengers to Carlsruhe.  Notwithstanding the assertion at thepacket-office, that we were to be in one day to Leopoldshaffen, in oneday more to Strasburg, we found there was no steamer until the day afterthe morrow, and that we must wait one day more if we did not choose togo to Carlsruhe.  The females, being fatigued, preferred remaining wherethey were.  We sauntered about and amused ourselves quietly.  The nextday, we found the steamer had arrived, and that instead of her ascendingin one day to Strasburg, it would take a day and a half, and that wemust pass the night aboard without the least accommodation--not verypleasant, with a carriage full of young children.  We embarked on boardthe steamer, which was a miserable small vessel, with an engine of badconstruction, and very small power; and with this we were to oppose themost rapid part of the Rhine.  In every other point the vessel wasequally ill found: they had a very small stock of provisions, bad wine,and none of those comforts provided for the passengers in the othervessels.  To crown all, another family with children (of whom morehereafter) had taken their passage.  The steward told us, that neverexpecting so many people on board going up to Strasburg, he was totallyunprepared; and so it eventually appeared.We started, and soon found out that the power of the engines was quitedisproportionate to the object in view.  The Rhine now assumed a moredesolate character.  For miles and miles not a village nor even asolitary town to be seen; the Hartz mountains forming a blue opaque massin the distance; the stream rapidly passing through narrow and deepchannels, leaving one half of the bed of the river dry.  At times wepassed very dangerous straits, where the waters boiled and eddied overreefs of rocks, and were often obliged to force our way by keepingwithin a foot of steep and muddy banks, where trees torn up, and hangingby the roots, proved how violent must be the current when the river isincreased by the melting of the mountain snow.Our progress was, as it may be imagined, most tedious; at no time did weadvance above a mile and a half per hour; sometimes we did not gain ahundred yards in the same time, and occasionally we were swept back bythe current, and had to lose still more ground, while they increased thepower of the engine at the risk of explosion.  The consequence was, thatwhen the day closed, the conducteur gave his opinion, that instead ofbeing at Strasburg by eleven or twelve o'clock the next day, we shouldnot arrive till four or five o'clock: we anchored within a yard of thebank, and prepared to pass the night how we could.Our party consisted of seven, with two nurses.  The other partyconsisted of four grown-up females, one male, four boys, an East Africannegro, and a _cowskin_; the latter was a very important personage, andmade a great noise during the passage.  The gentleman was apparently oneof those who denominate themselves eclectic: he paid very littleattention to what was going on; a peaceable sort of man, whose veryphysiognomy said "any thing for a quiet life:" one of the ladies was hiswife, and two others, virgins of some standing, apparently his sisters;the other lady, a bilious-looking sort of personage, and happy in beingthe mother of four very fine boys, as great pickles as ever lived; theseshe kept in order with the assistance of the negro and the cowskin, theuse of the latter occasioning such evident marks of astonishment andhorror to _our_ little ones, as not to be at all satisfactory to thelady in question, who appeared not averse, had she dared, to have giventhem a taste of it.  The youngest and the youngest but one of the boyswere the two sufferers; the youngest had a regular dozen administeredevery half hour.  The two eldest were more particularly under the careof the negro, who used his fists, I presume because they wore corduroys,and, as Hood says, did not care for "cut behind."  We had not been inthe vessel two minutes before there was a _breeze_.  I heard the negroexpostulating as follows:--"You very foolish boy, what you mean? whoever heard of putting new cloth cap into water to catch fish?"  This wasthe first offence.  I must say that the coercion used did not appear tooriginate from any feeling of regard for the children, for they wereallowed to climb, and push, and run over the sky-lights, and over theengine, and I every moment expected that some of them would be providedfor either by the cog-wheels or the river Rhine.It was evident at once, not only from the above accessories, but fromthe Chinese trunks which contained their luggage, that they were anIndian importation, and their behaviour subsequently proved it, beyondall doubt, even if they had not made it known--not by talking to us, butby talking at us, for they evidently did not consider that we weresufficiently respectable to be admitted into their society, even in theshort intercourse of fellow-travellers.I cannot here help making an observation relative to most of the peoplewho come from India.  They are always dissatisfied, and would gladlyreturn.  The reason is very obvious; they at once lose their rank andconsequence, and sink down to the level which they are entitled to inEnglish society.  In India the rank of the servants of the Company takesprecedence; but whatever their rank or emolument may be in India, theyare still but servants of a company of merchants, and such rank is not,of course, allowed in England.  Accustomed to unlimited sway and controlover a host of fawning slaves, and to that attention as females--which,where females are not very plentiful, is most sedulously paid--accustomed to patronise the newcomers, who, of course, feel grateful forsuch well-timed civility and hospitality--in short, accustomed to rank,splendour, wealth, and power--it is not surprising that, upon theirreturn to England, when they find themselves shorn of all these, andthat their station in society is far more removed from the apex, theybecome sullen and dissatisfied.  Of course, there are many who have beenresident in India, where family and connections insure them everyadvantage upon their return to their native country; but it must berecollected that the greater proportion of those who return consists ofthose who were of low origin, and who have obtained their appointmentsin reward for the exertions of their parents in behalf of their patronsin parliamentary returns, etcetera, and of young females who have (withtheir face as their fortune) been shipped off to India upon amatrimonial speculation.  Now, however high in rank they may have, inthe course of many years' service, arrived to in India, when they returnthey are nobodies; and unless they bring with them such wealth as towarrant their being designated as nabobs, their chance of admittanceinto the best society is very small indeed.I have said that they _talked_ at us, and not to us.  The gentleman wascivil, and would have conversed, but he was immediately interrupted andsent off on a message; and, for a quiet life, he gave it up.  The systemof talking at people always reminds me of the play of the "Critic," inwhich it is asked why, if "he knows all this, it is necessary to tellhim again?"  Simply because the audience do not; so, the party inquestion were the actors, and we were the audience to be informed.  Theconversation between the adults run as follows:--"You recollect how polite Lord C-- was to us at --?""To be sure I do.""Lady D-- told me so and so.""Yes, I recollect it very well.""What a nice man the Honourable Mr E-- is!""Yes, that he is.""How very intimate we were at -- with Lady G--.""That we were."And so on, during the whole of the day, much to our edification.  Howcontemptible, how paltry is such vanity!  But with their indulgence ofit for our amusement, the cow-skin, and a scanty dinner, we got throughthe first day, during which two or three occasional patronisingquestions or remarks were thrown at our heads, and then they reverted totheir own assumed exclusiveness.  The night, as may be supposed, wasanything but comfortable to those in the cabin; but I shall not dwellupon what, if fairly narrated, would be a very pretty sketch of humannature.We were to arrive the next day at five o'clock in the afternoon, but wetoiled on; and the sun at last went down, and we found ourselves withthe steeple of Strasburg a long way off.  We again anchored, and had topass another night in this miserable vessel and delightful company.  Thedetention, of course, made our fellow-passengers more cross; and could Ihave obtained possession of the cowskin, I would certainly have thrownit overboard.  The captain sent a man on shore to procure us somethingto eat, for the steward declared himself bankrupt.  The next forenoon wearrived at the bridge of boats between Kehl and Strasburg; and thus wasfinished our tedious and unpleasant voyage, of which I have given adescription as a warning to all future travellers.  Ourfellow-passengers did once condescend to address and inform us that theyhad left England (a party of ten people) only to pay a visit to somefriends in Switzerland--an expensive sort of trip, and which did notappear at all consistent with the fact that they were travelling withouta carriage or female servants.  Be it as it might, we separated withoutso much as a salutation or good-bye being exchanged.Much of the picturesque on the Rhine is destroyed by the vineyards,which are, in reality, the most unpoetical things in landscape scenery,being ranged up the sides of the mountains in little battalions likeinfantry.  It is remarkable in how shallow and how very poor a soil thevine will grow.  At Saint Michael's, they dig square holes in thevolcanic rocks, and the vines find sustenance.  At the Cape of Good Hopethe Constantia vineyards are planted upon little more than sand.  I dugdown some depth; and could find nothing else.  The finest grapes grownin Burgundy are upon a stratum of soil little more than a foot deep,over schistus slate quarries, and the soil itself composed chiefly ofthe _debris_ of this soft rock.We know that the vegetable creation has a sort of instinct as well asthe animal and it appears to me that there are different degrees ofinstinct in that portion of nature as well as in the other.  A vine, forinstance, I take to be a very clever plant, and both apple andpear-trees to be great fools.  The vine will always seek its ownnourishment, hunting with its roots through the soil for the aliment itrequires; and if it cannot find it where it is planted, it will seek, inevery direction and to a great distance, to obtain it.  It is assertedthat the famous vine at Hampton Court has passed its roots under the bedof the river, and obtains aliment from the soil on the other side; butan apple or pear-tree will take no such trouble--it will not even avoidwhat is noxious.  Plant one of these trees in the mould three or fourfeet above the marl or clay; so long as the roots remain in the mould,the tree will flourish, but so soon as the tap root pierces down to themarl or clay below the mould, the tree will canker and die.  To preventthis, it is the custom to dig first down to the marl and put a layer oftiles upon it, which turn the roots of the trees from a perpendicular toa horizontal direction, and then they do well; but leave the treewithout assistance, and the fool will commit suicide, blindly rushing toits own destruction; while the vine will not only avoid it, but useevery exertion to procure what is necessary for its continuing in healthand vigour.  The vine is therefore certainly the more intellectual plantof the two.CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.Strasbourg.There certainly is an impulse implanted in our natures to lovesomething; our affections were never intended to lie in abeyance, and ifthey cannot be placed upon the other sex or our own children, they stillseek something as an object.  This accounts for old bachelors being fondof their nephews and nieces, for blood relationship has nothing to dowith it; and for old ladies, who have not entered into wedlock, becomingso attached to dogs, cats, and parrots.  Sometimes, indeed, theaffections take much wilder flights in the pursuit of an object, andexhibit strange idiosyncrasies; but still it proves by nature we arecompelled to love something.  I have been reflecting how far thisprinciple may not be supposed to pervade through the universe, andwhether we cannot trace it in the inferiors of the animal creation:whether we cannot trace a small remnant of Paradise in the beasts whoenjoyed it with man, as well as in man himself.  It is well known thatanimals will take very strong and very strange attachments towards otheranimals.  It is, perhaps, more apparent in domestic animals, but is notthat because they are more brought together and more under our immediateeye? in some instances, as in the case when maternal feelings areroused, the strongest antipathies and habit will be controlled.  A catlosing her kittens has been known to suckle a brood of young rats, butin this case I consider instinct to have been the most powerful agent;wild beasts confined in cages show the same propensity.  The lionsecluded in his den has often been known to foster and become stronglyattached to a dog thrown in to him to be devoured; but there never wasan instance of a lion or any other wild beast, which had a female in thesame den or even a companion of its own species, preserving the life ofany other living creature thrown in to him.  This feeling occasions alsothe production of Hybrids; which in a wild state could never take place.There is not, probably, a more ferocious or ill-tempered animal thanthe bear when it is grown up; it is subdued by fear, but shows noattachment to its keeper; yet, the other day I fell in with a remarkablenarration proving the feeling I have referred to, actuating even thisanimal.  A proof of the bad feeling of a bear is fully established bythe fact that, although Martin, as the old bear is called in the Jardindes Plantes, at Paris, had been confined in his fosse nearly twentyyears, during which time not a day passed that he was not well fed bythe people who amused themselves in the gardens, when a man fell intohis pit, he immediately destroyed him.  It does, however, appear, thatall bears are not so ill-tempered as Monsieur Martin.  Leopold, Duke ofLorraine, had a bear confined by a long chain, near the palisades belowthe glacis.  Some poor Savoyard boys, who had emigrated as they stilldo, with the hopes of picking up some money to take back with them, hadtaken shelter in an out-house daring a severe snow storm.  One of themwho was numbed with the cold, thought that he would try if he could notfind some warmer berth, and in seeking this, as the snow fell fast, heat last crawled nearly exhausted into the kennel of the bear.  Insteadof tearing the lad to pieces, the bear took him in his fore paws, andpressed him to his shaggy warm coat till he was quite recovered.  A beargenerally receives you with open arms, whatever may be his ultimatedecision; but in this instance it was favourable.  The poor little boyfinding himself in good quarters, went fast asleep; the next morning hesallied forth to obtain some victuals if he could, but without success.Cold and hunger drove him again to the kennel of the bear, who not onlywas delighted to see him, but had actually laid aside a portion of hissupper for the boy's use.  The amicable arrangement continued for somedays, and the bear, at last, would not touch his victuals till the boy'sreturn.  This peculiar friendship was at last discovered, and the storynarrated to the Duke, who sent for the boy, and took care of him,admitting him into his own household.  The narrator observes that theboy died a year or two after this unusual occurrence had taken place.  Ihave no doubt but that many more instances might be brought forward byothers to establish my supposition.  To us, all wild animals of the samespecies appear to be much alike in disposition, because we have not anopportunity of examining and watching them carefully, but I shouldrather imagine, that as we can perceive such a manifest difference intemper between individual horses and dogs and other animals who aredomesticated, that the same difference must exist in the wild species,and that, in fact, there may be shades of virtue and vice in lions,tigers, bears, and other animals; and that there does exist in animalsas well as in man, more or less according to their natural dispositions,a remnant of those affections which in the garden of our first parentswere so strongly implanted as to induce the lion to lie down with thelamb.  "God is Love," says the Scriptures; before the devil found hisway to this earth all was love, for God only was there.  Now manstruggles between the two principles of good and evil.  When his naturewas changed, so was that of animals; but the principle not being extinctin man, why should not a portion still remain in the rest of thecreation, who with him were permitted to inhabit the garden of Eden, andwhose savage natures were not roused until with man they were drivenfrom that abode of peace?The most affectionate animal that I know of is the common brownMongoose: it is a creature between the squirrel and the monkey, with allthe liveliness but without any of the mischief of the latter.Unfortunately they will not live in our country, or they would supersedethe cat altogether; they are very clean, and their attachment is beyondall conception to those who have not seen them.  They will leap on theirmaster's shoulder, or get into his bed, and coil their long bushy tailsround his neck like a boa, remaining there for hours if permitted.  Irecollect one poor little fellow who was in his basket dying--much tothe grief of his master--who, just before he expired, crawled out of hisstraw and went to his master's cot, where he had just sufficientstrength to take his place upon his bosom, coil his tail round his neck,and then he died.Hares and rabbits are also very affectionate.  One of my little girlshad one of the latter, which she brought up in the house.  He grew verylarge, and was domesticated just like a dog, following you everywhere,in the parlour and up into the bed-room; in the winter lying on the rugbefore the fire on his side, and stretching out his four legs asunconcerned as possible, even refusing to go away if you pushed him.  Asfor the cat, she durst not go near him.  He thrashed her unmercifully,for he was very strong; and the consequence was that she retired to thekitchen, where he would often go down, and if she was in his way driveher out.  The hare and rabbit, as well as the deer tribe, defendthemselves by striking with their fore paws, and the blow which they cangive is more forcible than people would suppose.  One day when I was ina cover, leaning against a tree, with my gun in my hand, I presume forsome time I must have been in deep thought, I heard a rustling and thena squeak on the other side of the tree; I looked round the trunk, andbeheld a curious combat between two hares and a stoat.  The hares weremale and female, and had their leveret between them, which latter wasnot above six weeks old.  The stoat--a little devil with all its hair,from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail, standing at end--was atabout two yards distance from them, working round and round to have anopportunity to spring upon the leveret, which was the object of itsattack.  As it went round so did the hares face him, pivoting on acentre with the young one between them.  At last the stoat made a springupon the leveret.  He was received by the hares, who struck him withtheir fore feet such blows as I could not have believed possible; theyactually resounded, and he was rolled over and over until he got out ofdistance, when he shook himself and renewed his attacks.  Thesecontinued about ten minutes, and every time he was beaten off; but, atevery spring, his teeth went into the poor little leveret; at last itgave its last squeak, turned over on its side, and died, the father andmother still holding their relative situations, and facing the stoat.The latter showed as much prudence as courage; for so soon as heperceived that the leveret was dead, he also walked off.  The haresturned round to their young one, smelt at it apparently, pushed it withtheir noses, and shortly after, as if aware that it was past alldefence, hopped slowly away; they were hardly out of sight in the busheswhen back came the stoat, threw the leveret, twice as big as himself,over his shoulders, and went off with his prize at a hard gallop,reminding me, in miniature, of the Bengal tiger carrying off a bullock.All the actors in the drama having gone off; I walked off, and shortlyafter both barrels of my gun went off, so the whole party disappeared,and there's an end of my story.If an elephant were not so very unwieldy, and at the same time so veryuncertain in his temper, he is the animal who has the most claims fromaffection and intelligence to be made a pet of; but an elephant in adrawing-room would be somewhat incommodious; and, although one may admita little irritability of temper in a lap-dog weighing three pounds, theanger of an elephant, although he expresses himself very sorry for itafterwards, is attended with serious consequences.  There is somethingvery peculiar about an elephant in his anger and irritability.  Itsometimes happens that, at a certain season, a wild elephant will leavethe herd and remain in the woods alone.  It is supposed, and I thinkthat the supposition is correct, that these are the weaker males whohave been driven away by the stronger, in fact, they are elephantscrossed in love; and when in that unfortunate dilemma, they are verymischievous, and play as many fantastic tricks as ever did any of theknights of the round table on similar occasions in times of yore.I was at Trincomalee; an elephant in this situation had taken possessionof the road at some leagues distant, and, for reasons best known tohimself, would not allow a soul to pass it.  He remained _perdu_ in thejungle till he saw somebody coming, and then he would burst out andattack them.  It is the custom to travel in palanquins from one part ofthe island to another, as in all parts of India.  If some officer orgentleman was obliged to proceed to Colombo or elsewhere, so soon as thepalanquin came towards him, out came the elephant; the native bearers,who knew that it was no use arguing the point, dropped the palanquin andfled, and all that the occupant could do was to bundle out and do thesame before the elephant came up, otherwise he had little chance of hislife, for the elephant immediately put his knees in the palanquin andsmashed it to atoms.  Having done this, he would toss the fragments inthe air in every direction, at the same time carefully unfolding all thearticles contained in the palanquin for the occupants use--shirts,trowsers, boots, bottles, books, undergoing a most rigid examination,and after that being rendered to fragments.  If the cooley who had thecharge of the bag of letters made his appearance, he was immediatelypursued until he gave up the whole correspondence, official or private.The bag was opened, every letter was opened one by one, and then torn infragments and tossed to the winds.  In this way did he keep possessionof the road, stopping all communication for several weeks, until it washis sovereign will and pleasure that people might receive their lettersand travel across the country as before.  Now what an unaccountablefreak was this!  It was like the madness of a reasonable being.  If Irecollect right, it was when Captain Owen was on the east coast ofAfrica, some of his party who landed were attacked by elephants, whothrew them down on the ground and, instead of killing them, as mighthave been expected, and would have given them no trouble, they drew up alarge quantity of mud in their trunks and poured it into their mouths soas to nearly to suffocate them, and then left them.  On anotheroccasion, they put their fore feet on their limbs, so as to pinch andbruise them severely in every part of their bodies, but avoided theirbones so as not to fracture one.  Now this was evidently two species oftorture invented by the elephants, and these elephants in a wild state.There certainly is something very incomprehensible about these animals.The lion has been styled the king of beasts, but I think he is anusurper allowed to remain on the throne by public opinion and suffrage,from the majesty of his appearance.  In every other point he has noclaim.  He is the head of the feline or cat species, and has all thetreachery, cruelty, and wanton love for blood that all this class ofanimals have to excess.  The lion, like the tiger and the cat, will notcome boldly on to his prey, but springs from his concealment.  It istrue that he will face his assailants bravely when wounded, but so willthe tiger.In my opinion, the horse is the most noble of all animals, and, I amsorry to say, the most ill-used, at least in England; for I do notrecollect a single instance of having seen a horse ill-treated on theContinent.  In fact, you hardly ever see a horse on the Continent thatis not in good working condition: you never meet the miserable, lame,blind, and worn-out animals that you do in England, which stumble alongwith their loads behind them till they stumble into their graves.  Ifany one would take the trouble to make friends with their horses, theywould be astonished at the intelligence and affection of this nobleanimal; but we leave him to our grooms, who prefer to use force tokindness.  At the same time, I have observed, even in colts, verydifferent dispositions; some are much more fond and good-tempered thanothers; but let them be what they will as colts, they are soon spoiledby the cruelty and want of judgment of those who have charge of them inthe stable.  The sympathy between the Arab and his horse is well known:the horse will lie down in the tent, and the children have no fear ofreceiving a kick; on the contrary, they roll upon, and with him: such isthe result of kindness.  And I can now give a proof of the effects ofthe contrary, as it was, in this instance, what may be termed _maliceprepense_ in the animal.  The horses used in the West Indies aresupplied from the Spanish Main; they are from the Andalusian stockoriginally, partly Arab and barb.  These horses are taken by the lassofrom the prairies, and are broken in as follows:--They head them down tothe sea beach, saddle and bridle them for the first time, and mount themwith a pair of spurs, the rowels of which are an inch long.  So soon asthe animal plunges and attempts to divest himself of his rider, he isforced into the sea, and there he is worked in and out of his depth tillhe is fairly worn out and exhausted.  This is repeated once or twicetill they are submissive, and then they are sent off as broke-in horsesto the West India Islands.  A friend of mine had a very beautifulanimal, which he had purchased from one of these ships.  He had notbought him more than a week before he took the bit in his mouth, and ranaway with the black boy who was exercising him.  The boy lost his seatand fell, and the horse, for a hundred yards, continued his career; andthen it stopped, turned round, and galloped up to the boy, who was stillon the ground, and never ceased kicking him till the poor fellow'sbrains were scattered in the road.  Now this was evidently determinationfor revenge.CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.Strasbourg is full of the pomp and circumstance of war.  Being one ofthe keys of France, it has a garrison of ten thousand men, and the drumsand bands play from morning to evening, much to the delight of thechildren, at all events.  It is a well-built town, although the housesare most of them of very ancient date, with three stories of_mansardes_, in their high-peaked roofs.  I am rather partial to theAlsatian character; it is a combination of French, Swiss, and German,which make a very good cross.  Not being in any particular hurry, I haveremained here ten days, and I will say for Strasbourg, that it has manyrecommendations.  It is lively and bustling; the walks outside theramparts are beautiful, and living is very reasonable.  It has, however,the reputation of being a very unhealthy place, and, I am afraid, withtruth.  It is singular that the beautiful cathedral, although it hasalready suffered so much by lightning, has not yet been fitted with aconductor.  There was a meeting of the dignitaries some years back; someargued in favour and some against it, and it ended in neither partybeing persuaded, and nothing being done.  I met another Englishman here,to whom the question might so properly be put, "What the deuce are youdoing here?"  An old worthy, nearly seventy, who, after having passedhis fair allowance of life very happily in his own country, must,forsooth, come up the Rhine, without being able to speak a word ofFrench, or any other language but his own.  He very truly told me thathe had just begun to see the world at a time that he should be thinkingof going out of it.  He honoured me with the office of interpreter aslong as he stayed, and I was not sorry to see him booked for thesteam-boat, all the way to the London Custom House stairs.There is one remarkable point about the town of Strasbourg, which is,that the Protestants and Catholics have, I believe always, and do now,live in a state of amity which ought to be an example to others.  Inrunning over the history of the town, I do not find that they everpersecuted each other; but if they have not persecuted each other, I amshocked to say that they have not spared the Jews.  At the time of theplague, they accused the Jews of having occasioned it by poisoning thewells, and only burnt alive _two thousand of them at once_!  I wonderwhen the lightning struck the cathedral they did not drown two thousandmore in the Rhine--strange Christianity! when smitten by the hand ofGod, to revenge themselves by smiting their fellow-creatures.  I had tocall upon a Professor here upon some business; he amused me very much;he fancied that he could speak English: perhaps he might have been ableto do so at one time, but if so, he had forgotten it, but he did notthink he had.  I addressed him in French, and told him my business."Sir, you speak English?"--"Yes," replied I.  "Then, Sir, I tell youthat--" Then he stopped, pondering and perplexed for some minutes,without saying a syllable.  "Speak French, Sir," said I; "I perceivethat you have forgotten a word in our language;" and I then put anotherleading question to him, to which he replied, "Yes, I recollect thatvery well, and I--" Then another dead pause for the verb.  I waited aminute in perfect silence, but his memory was as treacherous as he wasobstinately bent upon talking English, and then I again spoke to him,and he replied, "That is true, that you must--" Then he broke downagain, and I broke up the conference, as I really could not wait untilhe formed English words, and he was evidently resolved that he wouldspeak in no other language.  Fortunately, it was no business of my own,but a commission from another, which ended in an omission, which,perhaps, did quite as well.This morning I strolled into a small _debit de tabac_, to fill my box,and it being excessively warm, was not sorry to sit down and enter intoa conversation with the young woman who attended upon the customers.  Iasked her, among other questions, if the shop was hers.  She replied,"That she had hired the license."  This answer struck me, and I inquiredif she could obtain a license for herself.  She replied, "No, unless,"said she, laughing, "I should marry some old _estropie_ who has beenworn out in the service."  She then informed me of what I was not awarewhich is, that instead of giving pensions to the old militaires, theygive them, and them only, the licenses for selling tobacco.  They mayeither carry on the trade themselves, or may lease out their licenses toothers, for as much as they can obtain for it per year.I perceive that the Gallic cock now struts on the head of the staff,bearing regimental colours, instead of the eagle of Napoleon.  Theycertainly have made the cock a most imposing bird, but still a cock isnot an eagle.  The couplets written upon this change, which was made byLouis Philippe, are somewhat sarcastic:--  "Le vaillant coq Gaulois,  Grattant sur le fumier,  A fait sortir le roi  Louis Philippe Premier;  Qui par juste reconnoissance  Le mit dans les armes de France."Did not sleep very comfortably this night; there were too many of us inthe bed, and all of us bits of philosophers.  I am a bit of aphilosopher myself, and surely fleas cannot be considered more than verylittle bits.  All French fleas are philosophers, it having been fairlyestablished by a French punster that they belong to the _secte--d'Epicure (des piqueurs_).The English who go up the Rhine to Switzerland generally proceed on theGerman side.  Few pass through Alsace or German France, and those whodo, take the shortest route, by which they avoid Colmar.  As I took thelongest in preference, I shall in few words point out the features ofthe country.  You pass through the valley of the Rhine, which is flatand fertile to excess, the only break in the uniformity of the countrybeing the chain of Vorges mountains, distant about eight miles on yourright, and the occasional passage of the dry bed of a winter torrentfrom the mountains.  The cathedral at Colmar is well worth seeing.  Inoutward architecture it is not very remarkable, but its painted windowsare quite as fine as those of Strasbourg; and, in one point, it excelsall the cathedrals I have seen, which is the choir, handsomely carved inoak, and with good pictures let into the panels.  It is in better taste,more solid, and less meretricious in its ornaments, than any I know of.It has also a very fine pulpit, the whole of which, as well as the stepsand balustrade leading up to it, is of fine marble.  At Colmar, the eyewill be struck with the peculiarity of architecture in some of the oldbuildings; it very often is pure Saracenic.  The roads being excellent,we arrived in good time at Basle.Once more in Switzerland; I have more pleasure now in revisiting acountry which has left pleasant reminiscences in my mind, than inpassing through one hitherto unexplored.  In the latter case, I amusually disappointed.  When we revisit those spots in which ourchildhood was passed, how invariably do we find that the memory is trueto what the place appeared to us when children, and hardly to berecognised when our ideas and powers of mind have been developed andenlarged in proportion with our frames.  Is it possible? thought I, whenI returned, after a lapse of fifteen years, to the house of my childhoodout of mere curiosity, for my family had long quitted it.  Is this thepond which appeared so immense to my eyes, and this the house in mymemory so vast?  Why it is a nutshell!  I presume that we estimate therelative size of objects in proportion to our stature, and, as whenchildren, we are only half the size of men, of course, to children,everything appears to be twice the size which it really is.  And notonly the objects about us, but everything in the moral world as well.Our joy is twice the joy of others, and our grief, for the moment, twiceas deep: and these joys and griefs all for trifles.  Our code of rightand wrong is equally magnified: trifles appeared to be crimes of thefirst magnitude, and the punishments, slight as they were, enough todissolve our whole frame into tears until we were pardoned.  Oh dear!all that's gone, as Byron says--  "No more, no more, O never more on me,  The freshness of the heart shall fall like dew."The cathedral at Basle is nearly one thousand years old, which is a ripeold age, even for a cathedral.  I believe that it is only inSwitzerland, and England, and Holland, that you find the Protestants inpossession of these edifices, raised to celebrate the Catholic faith.I met here a very intelligent Frenchman who has resided many years inthe town.  One of the first questions I put to him was the following:For more than twenty years Switzerland has been overrun with English andother visitors, who have spent an enormous sum of money in the country:what has become of all this money?He replied that I might well ask the question."They have no banks in Switzerland; and, although land exchanges owners,still the money does not leave the country.  We have here," he said, "afew millionaires, who do lend their money in France upon goodsecurities; but except these few, they do nothing with it.  The interestof money is so low, that I have known it lent by one of the rich peopleat two-and-a-half per cent; and the Swiss in general, in preference torisking what they can obtain for so small a premium, allow it to remainin their chests.  There is, at this present moment more bullion inSwitzerland than in any other country in Europe, or, perhaps, than inall the countries in Europe.  A Swiss is fond of his money, and he doesnot use it; the millionaires that we have here, make no alteration intheir quiet and plain state of living."  He then continued, "At thismoment, those who can afford to spend their money at Basle areretrenching, not from motives of economy, but from feelings of ill will.The burghers, who have country seats, to which they retire during thesummer, have abandoned them, and if any one wished to settle in thiscanton, they might purchase them for half their value.  The reason is,that there has been a difference between the town burghers and thecountry people.  The canton wanted a reform bill to be passed, in whichthey have not succeeded.  They required a more equitablerepresentation--the country people amount to about forty thousand, thetown of Basle to only ten thousand; and the town of Basle, nevertheless,returns two-thirds of the council, which governs the canton, to whichthe people who live in the country have raised objections.  Hence thevariance; and to punish the country people by not spending their moneyamong them, the burghers have abandoned their country houses."It may not, perhaps, be generally known, that at the time of the threedays at Paris, there was an _emeute_ in Switzerland, in which thearistocracy were altogether put down; and in Berne, and some othercantons, the burghers' families, who, on pretence of preventing thearistocracy from enslaving the count, had held the reins of power for solong a period, were also forced to surrender that power to those who hadbeen so long refused participation in it.  This was but the naturalconsequence of the increase of wealth in the country: those who beforehad remained quiet, feeling themselves of more consequence, insistedupon their rights; and the usual results were, that the administrationof the government changed hands; but although this might be consideredas an advantage gained, still it was but a change, or rather anadmission of those who had become wealthy to a participation of theadvantages connected with the exercise of authority; a change beneficialto a few, but to the _masse_, productive of no real advantage.  AtBerne, to be a member of the government, is considered as a certainsource of wealth, a convincing proof that the interests of those whohold the reins are not neglected; and that in a republic it is asdifficult to insure to the people their legitimate rights, as under anyother form of government.  And so it will be as long as the world turnsround; man is everywhere the same exacting, selfish, preying creature;and his disposition is not to be changed.The Helvetic Republic is, in fact, nothing but an aggregation of pettydespotisms--leniently administered, I grant; but still nothing butdespotisms.  Those who are in power, or connected with those in power,are the only portion of the community who can amass large sums; and thusthe authority is handed down from one to the other within certainlimits, which it but rarely transgresses, something very nearlyapproximating to the corporations in England.In Switzerland, the working man remains the working man, the labourerthe labourer, almost as distinct as the Indian castes the nobles arecrushed, and the haughty burgh rules with all the superciliousness ofvested right.I have always held a "respublica" as only to exist in theory or in name.History has proved the impossibility of its retaining its purity forhalf a century.  What the American Republic may be, it is impossible tosay, until one has been in the country, and discovered what itsadvocates have been careful to conceal.  The Americans had a greatadvantage in establishing this system of government; they had nothing tooverthrow, nothing to contend with.  They all started fair, and theirhalf century is now nearly complete.  Time will prove whether it bepossible in this world to govern, for any length of time, upon such abasis.  Mr Cooper, in his work on Switzerland, is evidentlydisappointed with his examination into the state of the HelveticRepublic; and he admits this without intending so to do.At Soleure I saw nothing very remarkable, except a dog with a very largegoitre on his neck, a sight which I never had witnessed before, duringthe long time that I wandered through Switzerland.On our way to Berne, to divide the day's travelling more equally, westopped at a small village, not usually the resting-place of travellers,and I there met with a little bit of romance in real life, which Sternewould have worked up well, but I am not sentimental.  The house, towhich the sign was the appendage, struck me, at first entering, as nothaving been built for an _hotellerie_; the rooms were low, but large,and the floors _parquette_; here and there were to be seen remains offormer wealth in pieces of _marquetterie_ for furniture, and clocks of_ormolu_.  There were some old prints, also, on the walls, very superiorto those hung up usually in the auberges of the continent, especially ina village auberge.  When the supper was brought up, I observed that thesilver forks and spoons were engraved with double arms and the coronetof a marquis.  I asked the female who brought up the soup, from whencethey had obtained them?  She replied, rather _brusquement_, that shesupposed they had been bought at the silversmith's, and left the room asif not wanting to be questioned.  The master of the auberge came up withsome wine.  He was a tall, fine, aristocratical-looking man, about sixtyyears of age, and I put the question to him.  He replied that theybelonged to the family who kept the inn.  "But," said I, "if so, it isnoble by both descents?"  "Yes," replied he, carelessly, "but they don'tthink anything of that beer."  After a few more questions, heacknowledged that they were the armorial bearings of his father andmother, but that the family had been unfortunate, and that, as no titheswere allowed in the country, he was now doing his best to support thefamily.  After this disclosure, we entered into a long discussionrelative to the Helvetic Republic, with which I shall not trouble myreaders.  Before I went, I inquired his name from one of the servants,and it immediately occurred to me that I had seen it in the list ofthose twenty-six who are mentioned as the leaders of the Swiss whodefeated the Burgundians, and whose monument is carved in the solid rockat Morat.  Two engravings of the monument were in the rooms we occupied,and I had amused myself with reading over the names.  I am no aristocratmyself, heaven knows! and if a country could be benefited, and libertyobtained, by the overthrow of the aristocracy, the sooner it is done thebetter; but when we see, as in Switzerland, the aristocracy reduced tokeeping village inns, and their inferiors, in every point, exerting thatvery despotism of which they complained, and to free the people fromwhich, was their pretence for a change of government, I cannot helpfeeling that if one is to be governed, let it be, at all events, bythose who, from the merits of their ancestors and their long-heldpossessions, have the most claim.  Those who are born to power are notso likely to have their heads turned by the possession of it as thosewho obtain it unexpectedly; and those who are above money-making areless likely to be corrupt than those who seek it.  The lower the classthat governs, the worse the government will be, and the greater thedespotism.  Switzerland is no longer a patriarchal land.  Wealth hasrolled into the country; and the time will come when there will be arevolution in the republic.  Nothing can prevent it, unless all thecantons are vested into one central government, instead of so many pettyoligarchies, as at present, and which will eventually tire out thepatience of the people.I parted from my noble host, and will do him the justice to say that hisbill was so moderate, compared to the others paid in Switzerland, that Ialmost wished that all the inns in the cantons were held by thenobility--that is, provided they would follow his example.  His wine wasexcellent, and I suspect was laid in long before the sign was hung up atthe door.From Soleure to Berne the whole road was lined with parties of troopsordered in that direction: every man of them was drunk, cheering, andhooting, and hallooing at us as we passed.  As for the peasant girlsthey met on the road, I really pitied them.  At last we have arrived atBerne.  The Bernese have chosen a most appropriate symbol in theirheraldic crests of the bear, and, as if they had not a sufficientquantity inside of their towns, they keep four in the ditch outside.What a difference between the _tables d'hote_ in Germany and inSwitzerland!  I always prefer the _table d'hote_ when it is respectable,for nothing is more unpleasant than remaining in a hotel shut up in yourown room; the latter may be more dignified and aristocratic, but it isnot the way to see the world; one might as well be in England, and,indeed, had much better.  A _table d'hote_ is a microcosm: you meetthere all nations, people of all professions--some idle, some busytravelling on important matters, others travelling for amusement.  Youare unfortunate if you do not fall in with one clever man at least, andyou are quite sure to meet with a fool, which is almost as amusing.When I survey a _table d'hote_ I often think of the calenders who hadall come to spend the _Ramadhan_ at Bagdad, and their histories; and Ihave thought that Grattan might make a very good series of Highways andByways if he could obtain the history of those who meet at this generalrendezvous.  The _tables d'hote_ in Germany are excellent, properlysupplied, and very moderate.  I cannot say so of those in Switzerland.The fondness of the Swiss for money betrays itself in everything, andinstead of liberality at the _table d'hote_, we have meanness.  Thedinner itself is dearer than in Germany, and not half so good; but whatis the most unexcusable part of our host's conduct is, that he halfserves his guests, as Sancho was served at Barataria; for instance, asis usually the case, the viands are put on the table and then removed tobe carved; two ducks will make their appearance at one end, two chickensat the other; are removed, and only one of each is cut up and handedround, the others are sent away whole to be re-dressed for some greatman who dines in his own room.  This has been constantly the case sinceI have been here.  It may be asked, why we do not remonstrate?  In thefirst place, I prefer watching my host's manoeuvres; and in the next,although I might get my duck, my host would charge me the whole value ofit when he sent in his bill.The French Ambassador could not have taken a better step to bring theSwiss to their senses than threatening them with a blockade.  It wouldhave been ruin to them.  All the golden harvests would have been over,their country would have been deserted, and their Ranz des Vaches wouldhave been listened to only by the cows.  As the French ministerexpected, the councils fumed and vapoured, the officers drew theirswords and flourished them, and then--very quietly pocketed the affrontthat they might not be out of pocket.  What a pity it is that a nationso brave and with so many good sterling qualities, should be, as itwould appear, so _innately_ mercenary!  There never was a truer sayingthan "Point d'argent, point de Suisse."CHAPTER THIRTY SIX.                                                                 Geneva.Twenty years have made a wonderful alteration in the good soberpuritanical city of Geneva.  The improvement from the new buildingswhich have been erected is so great, that I could hardly recognise theold city of Geneva in her dress.  It was an old friend with a new face,for as you enter the town, all the new buildings and streets meet yourview.  As far as it has proceeded (for there is much left yet to befinished), the new portion of Geneva is finer than any portion of Paris,upon an equal space of ground.  But what surprised me more was to readthe _affiches_ of the _Comedie_.  A theatre in Geneva!  When I was lasthere, a theatre was considered by the good people as criminal to thehighest degree.  I inquired where the theatre was to be found, and itwas all true--there _was_ a _theatre_.  I then made more inquiries.  Itappeared that Mammon had seduced the puritans of Geneva.  People wouldnot winter at Geneva; it was so dull--no amusements; and as soon as thesnow was knee deep at Chamouny, they all ordered horses and flew away toParis or Italy.  This affected the prosperity of the good citizens, andthey talked among themselves; but no one of the Town Council wouldpropose a theatre, until it was discovered, by private communication,that they were unanimously agreed,--then the proposition was started andcarried.  But there are many concomitants attending a theatre, and withthe theatre many other innovations have crept in; so that in a few yearsGeneva will be no better than Paris.  When I was last here, Science wasthe order of the day.  There were many celebrated men residing in thetown, but they are all gone to their forefathers.  Every branch ofNatural History had its _savant_; but, above all, Mineralogy was themost in vogue.  But Mineralogy has been superseded lately, by her eldestsister Geology, who, although not so pretty, has been declared moreinteresting and profound.  Still Mineralogy is the more scientific,although Geology is the more speculative.  In the education of children,I know no study which so enlarges the mind or gives a habit of researchand application, as that of Natural History; it is amusement andinstruction so happily blended, that it never tires.  Perhaps, thenatural cupidity of our natures assists, as the knowledge of every newspecimen is for the most part accompanied by the _possession_ of thespecimen and an addition to the collection.  Moreover, it is a tangiblestudy; not a nomenclature of things, but each substance is in your handto be examined.  The arrangement and classification gives a habit ofneatness and order, and children are taught to throw nothing away untilits value is known.  Every child should be made acquainted with NaturalHistory; and where the specimens can be obtained, and there is room forthem, they should be allowed to have a collection, such as minerals,corals, shells, and plants; for these sciences, amusing in themselves,will gradually impel them to the others more abstruse, as every branchof Natural Philosophy is intimately connected with them.  The mind willever be active, and if not interested in rational pursuits, it will flyoff to the sensual.They have a very excellent plan in Switzerland, in many of the boys'schools, of all the scholars setting off together on a pedestrian tourof some weeks.  You will meet a whole school of thirty or forty urchins,with their knapsacks on their shoulders, attired in blouses, trudgingaway from town to town, and from mountain to mountain, to visit all theremarkable peculiarities of the country.This is a most excellent method of relaxing from study, and invigoratingthe mind at the same time that it is allowed to repose.  Neither is itso expensive as people would imagine.  One room will hold a great manyschool-boys, where the mattresses are spread over the floor: and I sawthem make a very hearty breakfast upon bread and cheese and threebottles of wine, among about forty of them.  Why should not the boysabout London set off on a tour to the lakes or elsewhere, in the sameway--every year changing the route.  They then would see something oftheir own country, which few do before they are launched in life, andhave no time to do afterwards.  I have never seen the lakes; in fact, Iknow nothing of my country, although I have scoured the world so long.I recollect that my father, who had never seen the Tower of London, wasdetermined every year that he would go and see it; but he never couldfind time, it appears, for he died without seeing it at last.  I did,however, make the observation, that if Geneva had backslided so far asto permit a theatre, there was a feeling that this innovation requiredbeing carefully opposed.  When I was at Geneva before, there was notheatre, but neither were there shops which dealt exclusively inreligious tracts and missionary works.  I observed on this my secondarrival, that there were a great many to serve as a check to theincreasing immorality of the age.I have referred to the change of twenty years, but what a change hasbeen effected in about three hundred years, in this very country.  Readwhat took place in these cantons at about the date which I havementioned.  I have been reading the chronicles.  Observe the powersassumed by the bishops of that period; they judged not only men butbrutes; and it must be admitted that there was some show of justice, asthe offending parties, being dumb themselves, were allowed lawyers toplead for them.How the lawyers were paid, has not been handed down; and it appears thatthe judgments were sometimes easier pronounced than carried intoexecution.At Basle, in the year 1474, it appears that a cock was accused of theenormous crime of having laid an egg: he was brought to trial andcondemned to be burnt alive, as a warning to all cocks not to lay eggs,from which it is well known would have been hatched a cockatrice orbasilisk.In 1481, cockchafers committed great ravages in the Grisons.  The Bishopof Coire condemned them all to transportation, and a barren valley wasassigned to them as their future residence.  Whether the cockchafersobeyed his Lordship's orders, is not handed down to posterity.Some years afterwards the river Aar was infested with leeches, whospoilt all the salmon.  The Bishop of Lausanne excommunicated the wholetribe of leeches in a solemn procession to the river; and it is dreadfulto reflect, that this excommunication remains upon their heads even untothis day.  Also next door, in France, in 1386, a sow was arraigned forhaving eaten a young child, and condemned to be hanged; to add to thedisgrace of her punishment, she was dressed _in man's clothes_.About the same period rats were extremely mischievous, and inconsequence were summoned to appear before my Lord the Bishop.  But therats had a good lawyer, who first asserted that the rats, beingdispersed in all the neighbouring villages, had not had time to collecttogether, and make their appearance; and that a second and a thirdsummons would be but an act of justice.  They were, therefore, againsummoned after the performance of mass on Sunday in each parish.Notwithstanding the three summonses, the rats did not appear in court,and then their defender asserted, that in consequence of the affairhaving been made so public by the three summonses, all the cats were onthe look-out, and therefore his clients dare not make their appearancewithout all the cats were destroyed.  The consequence of this difficultywas, that the rats were not punished for contempt of court.I have often thought that it is a great pity that agriculturalassociations in England do not send over a committee to examine into theprinciple upon which they build and load carts and waggons on theContinent.It is a point on which we are very unenlightened in England.  The wasteof wood in the building, and the wear and tear of horses, is enormous.We have yet many things to learn in England, and must not be ashamed toprofit from our neighbours.  One horse will do more work on theContinent, especially in France and Switzerland, from the scientificprinciples upon which their vehicles are built, and the loads are puton, than three horses will accomplish in England.  The inquiries of thecommittee might be extended much if they went to the AgriculturalAssociation at Berne; they would discover many things which have not yetentered into their philosophy.  I doubt very much whether thefour-course shift of Norfolk, where farming is considered the mostperfect, is not more expensive and more exhausting to the land, than theother systems resorted to on the Continent; that is, that it is not thatwhich will give the greatest possible returns at the minimum of expense.I have before observed how very seldom you see a horse out of conditionand unfit for work on the Continent; one great cause must be from theirnot being racked and torn to pieces by overloading; and notwithstandingwhich, the loads they draw are much heavier than those in England.  Ihave seen a load of many tons so exactly poised upon two wheels, thatthe shaft horse neither felt his saddle nor his belly-band.One great cause of the ill usage of horses in England is the disgracefulneglect of the public conveyances of all kinds.  If an alteration was tobe made in the regulations of hackney coaches and cabs, we should nolonger have our feelings tortured by the spectacles of horse miserywhich we daily meet with.  There are plenty of commissioners for hackneycoaches, and it is a pity that they had not something to do for themoney they receive, or else that they were abolished and their duty putinto the hands of the police.  It may appear a singular remark to make,but I cannot help thinking that there would be a good moral effect inthe improvement of hackney coaches.  There are a certain class of peoplein London, to whom these vehicles are at present of no use.  I refer tothose who have a sufficient independence, but who cannot afford to keeptheir carriages, and who, by the present system of social intercourse,are almost shut out of society, or are inclined to spend more money thanprudence would dictate.  In all other capitals, the hackney coaches areclean and respectable, and in some instances as good as a privatecarriage; and besides that, they have a superior kind of carriage forevening parties, which renders the expense of a private carriageunnecessary.  There certainly may be some excuse made for those whodislike hackney coaches pulling up at their doors, when we look at thedisgusting turn-outs of the London stands, at one time filled withdrunken men and women, at others carrying diseased people to thehospital, or dead bodies to the Surgeons' Hall.  An English hackneycoach is a type of misery, as regards the horses' outsides, and a_cloaca_ within; you know not, when you step into it, whether you arenot to encounter disease and death.  It may be said that there are suchvehicles as glass coaches, as they are termed; but those are only to behired by the day, and become very expensive.  The arrangements of thesevehicles should be under the police: every coach and cab should beexamined, at the commencement of the year, as to its appearance outsideas well as its cleanliness inside.  The horses should be inspected, andif not in fair working condition, and of a certain height, the licenseshould be refused.  And there should be a superior class allowed atcertain stands, who are entitled to demand a higher fare.  This wouldnot only be a boon to the public, but a much greater one to the poorhorse, who would not drag out his lengthened misery as he does now.When there was no longer any means of selling a poor brute, to whomdeath was a release, he would be put out of his misery.  It would alsobe a great improvement if the Numbers were put inside instead of out, asthey are abroad; and if _every_ description of vehicle, if well fitted,were licensed.CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.The Hotel des Bergues is certainly a splendid establishment; many peoplewinter at this hotel in preference to going to a pension, which is, withthe best arrangements, disagreeable, for you are obliged to conform tothe usages and customs, and to take your meals at certain hours, hungryor not hungry, as if it were a pension of school-boys and girls, and notgrown up people.  The price demanded is the same as at the pensions, viz200 francs, or 8 pounds per month, which includes everything but wineand fuel.  The establishment is certainly very well conducted.  There isa salon, next to the table d'hote, large enough to hold 200 people, wellwarmed and lighted, handsomely carpeted, with piano, books, prints,newspapers, card tables, etcetera.  Indeed, there is everything you wishfor, and you are all independent of each other, I was there for two orthree days, and found it very pleasant; I was amused with a circumstancewhich occurred.  One of the company, a Russian, sat down to the piano,and played and sang.  Every one wished to know who he was, and oninquiring, it was a Russian prince.  Now a prince is a very great personwhere princes are scarce, as they are in England, although in Russia, aprince, where princes are plenty as blackberries, is about on a par withan English baronet.He was a very honest off-hand sort of personage, and certainly gavehimself no airs on account of his birth and rank.  Nevertheless, theEnglish ladies, who were anxious that he should sing again, made a sortof deputation to him, and begged the honour of his highness favouringthem with a song, with every variety of courtesy and genuflexion."Oh yes, to be sure," replied his highness, who sat down and played foran hour, and then there was so much thanking, complimentaryacknowledgement of condescension on his part, etcetera, and the ladiesappeared so flattered when he spoke to them.  The next day it wasdiscovered that a slight mistake had occurred, and that, instead ofbeing a prince, he had only come to Geneva along with a Russian prince,and that the real prince was in his own room upstairs; upon which notonly he fell himself at least 200 per cent, but, what was really toobad, his singing fell also; and many who had been most loud in hispraises began to discover that he was not even a prince of musicians,which he certainly was.We had a good specimen of the independence and familiarity of Swissservants on the occasion of this gentleman's singing; they came into thesalon, and mixed almost with the company that they might listen to him;and had they been ordered out, would, in all probability, have refused.An American, with whom I was conversing, observed that in _his_ countrysuch conduct on the part of servants, notwithstanding what had been saidby English travellers on the subject, would never have been permitted.I have fallen in with some odd characters here.First, what would be considered a curiosity in England--a clergyman ofthe Church of England with mustachios!  What would the Bishop of Londonsay?--and yet I do not see how, if a clergyman choose to wear them, hecould be prevented.  He has good authority to quote; Calvin wore them,and so, I believe, did Luther.Secondly, with a personage who is very peculiarly disorganised when hedrinks too much.  His wife, a most amiable quiet lady, is the partywhose character is attacked.  As soon as Mr -- is in his cups, heimmediately fancies that his wife is affected with the liquor, and nothimself, and he tells everybody in a loud whisper his important secret."There now, look at Mrs --, one of the best women in the world; anexcellent wife and mother, and at most times as lady-like as you wouldwish to see: but look at her now--you see she's quite drunk, poor thing;what a pity, isn't it, that she cannot get over her unfortunatepropensity; but I am afeard it's no use.  I've reasoned with her.  It'sa sad pity, and a great drawback to my happiness.  Well, hang sorrow--itkilled a cat.  Don't notice what I've told you, and pass the bottle."I believe that the English are better acquainted with geography thanother nations.  I have been astonished at the ignorance on this point Ihave found in foreigners who otherwise were clever and well-informed menand women.  When the Marquis de Claremont Tonnere was appointed to theoffice of Minister of the Marine and Colonies, upon the restoration ofthe Bourbons, a friend of mine had an audience with him, and it was notuntil a very angry discussion, and a reference to the map, that he couldpersuade the minister that Martinique was an _island_.  However, in thisinstance we had nearly as great an error committed in our own Colonialoffice, which imagined that the Dutch settlement of Demerara upon thecoast of South America, and which had fallen into our hands, _was_ anisland; indeed, in the official papers it was spoken of as such.  Alittle before the French Revolution, a princess who lived in Normandydetermined upon a visit to her relations in Paris; and having a sistermarried to a Polish nobleman, she determined to take Poland in her way.To her astonishment, instead of a day to two, her voyage was notcompleted under four months.I have heard it often asserted, that you should not build your house soas to look at a fine prospect out of your windows, but so as to walk toview it at a short distance.  This may be true with the finest prospectsin other countries, but not so in Switzerland, where the view neverpalls upon the eye, from the constant changing which occurs in thetinting of the landscape.  You may look upon the Lake of Geneva everyday, and at no one day, or even portion of the day, is the effect thesame.  The mountains of Savoy are there, and change not their position:neither does the Lake; but at one time the mountains will appear tenmiles nearer to you than they will at another.  The changing arisingfrom refraction and reflection is wonderful.  Never did I witnessanything finer than the Lake of Geneva at the setting of yesterday'ssun.  The water was calm and glassy as a mirror, and it reflected inbroad patches, like so many islands dispersed over it, every colour ofthe rainbow.  I cannot attempt to describe it; the effect was heavenly,and all I could say was, with the Mussulman, "God is great!"CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.In this world we are so jealous of any discovery being made, thatinnovation is immediately stigmatised as quackery.  I say innovation,for improvement is not the term.  The attempt to improve is innovation,the success of the experiment makes it an improvement.  And yet how arewe to improve without experiment?  Thus we have quackery in everything,although not quite so severely visited as it formerly was by theInquisition who would have burnt alive him who asserted that the sun didnot go round the earth, but the earth round the sun.  In medicine,quackery is the most frequently stigmatised.  We know but little of thehuman frame as far as medicine is to act upon it.  We know still less ofthe virtues of various plants which will effect a cure.  We areacquainted with a few but there are hundreds equally powerful, theproperties of which we are ignorant of.  Could we add to medical sciencethe knowledge of the African negroes and Indians, which they socarefully conceal from us, our pharmacopoeia would be much extended.When metallic medicines were first introduced into general use by aphysician, an ancestor of mine, and the wonderful effect of themestablished by the cures, the whole fraternity was up in arms, and hewas decried us a quack; notwithstanding which, the works he wrote havegone through twenty five editions, and the doses prescribed by him areto this day made use of by the practitioners.The fact is, that although the surgical knowledge of the day is veryperfect, the medical art is still in its infancy.  Even the quackerieswhich fail should not be despised, for they have proved something,although they could not be perfected.  Animal magnetism, for instance:it failed, but still it discovered some peculiar properties, somesympathies of the human body, which may hereafter give a clue to moreimportant results.  The great proof of the imperfection of medicalscience is the constant change made by the profession itself.  Onemedicine is taken into favour, it is well received every where, untilthe faculty are tired of it, and it sinks into disgrace.  Even in mytime I have seen many changes of this sort, not only in medicine, but indiet, etcetera.What medical men would have thought of prescribing fat bacon fordelicate stomachs twenty years ago?  Now it is all the vogue; breakfastbacon sold in every quarter of the metropolis.  Either this is quackery,to use their own term, or twenty years ago they were very ignorant, fortheir patients received positive injunctions to avoid all fat and greasysubstances.Thus do the regular practitioners chop and change about, groping in thedark: but the only distinction is, that all changes made by the facultyare orthodox; but any alteration proposed out of the pale of MD, is aninnovation and a quackery.That we have every where ignorant men, who are _de facto_ quacks, Iadmit; but still that term has been as liberally applied to the attemptsof scientific and clever persons to improve the art of medicine.  Evenhomoeopathy must not be totally rejected until it has had a fair trial.It has one merit in it, at all events, that you take less physic.I consider the continual appearance of new quacks on the horizon a sureproof of the low state of our medical knowledge.  The more so as thesequacks, although they kill, do effect very remarkable cures.  Do notregular practitioners kill also? or rather, do not their prescriptionsfail?  If a quack cures, they will tell you that it was by mereaccident.  I suspect that there is more of accident in the practice thanthe faculty are ready to admit; and Heaven knows they so change aboutthemselves, that it is clear that they feel no confidence in the littlethat they do know; and it is because medicine is so imperfect that everyhalf century we have a new quack, as he is termed, rising up, andbeating the regular practitioners out of the field.  I could tell astory about Morrison's pills which would surprise not a little, and allthe parties are now alive to prove it; but instead of that, I will tellanother which occurred in France, in which a quack medicine had a mostwonderful and unusual effect, for it was the means of the _totaldestruction of a Banditti_, who had defied the Government of the countryfor many years.  About twenty years ago,--I am not sure whether he stilllives,--there was an irregular practitioner in France of the name of LeRoi.  He was, by all accounts, the King of all Empirics, and the Emperorof all Quacks.  He was more potent than the sovereign, and the _parl'ordre du Roi_ of Government was insignificant, compared to the _parl'ordre du Roi_ of this more potent personage.  He did not publish hiscures in _pamphlets_, but in large _quartos_.  I have seen them myself,larger in size than an Ainsworth's dictionary.  It so happened that anEnglishman, who was afflicted with the _indescribables_, was recommendedfrom every quarter to buy the medicines of Monsieur Le Roi.  He did so,and his unknown complaint was removed.  The consequence was, that theEnglishman swore by Le Roi; and as he was proceeding on to Spain, hetook with him a large supply of the doctor's medicines, that he might beprepared in case his complaint should return.  All quack gentlemen takecare that their medicines shall be palatable; no unwise precaution.  Ido not know a better dram than Solomon's Balm of Gilead.  Old Solomon,by the bye, lived near Plymouth, and was very partial to the Navy.  Hekept an excellent table, and was very hospitable.I recollect one day after the officers had drunk a very sufficientquantity of his claret and champagne, being a little elevated, theyinsisted upon Solomon bringing them out some Balm of Gilead as a finish,and they cleared off about two dozen one guinea bottles.  The oldgentleman made no objection to provide it as often as they called formore, and they separated; but the next day he sent them all their billsin for the said Balm of Gilead, observing, that although they werewelcome to his wine and table, that he must be paid for his medicine.But to proceed.The Englishman travelled with the king's messenger; most of his baggagehad been sent on, but he would not part with his medicine, and this wasall in the vehicle with himself.  As they passed the Pyrenees they werestopped by the banditti, who dragged them out of the carriage, aftershooting the postilion, and made them lie with their faces on theground, with guards over them, while they rifled the carriage.  Theysoon came to the packages of medicine, and observing that _Le Roi_ wasupon all the bottles, and knowing that they had possession of a king'smessenger, they imagined that this was some liquor sent as a present tothe King of Spain; they tasted it, and found that, like other quackmedicines, it was very strong and very good.Each man took his bottle, drank the king's health, and mirth and revelrytook place, until they had consumed all that the Englishman had broughtwith him.  Now there is a great difference between taking atable-spoonful, and six or seven bottles per man; and so it proved, forthey had hardly finished the last case before they found that themedicine acted very powerfully as a cathartic; the whole banditti weresimultaneously attacked with a most violent cholera; they disappearedone by one; at last the guards could contain themselves no longer, andthey went off too.  The two prisoners, perceiving this, rose from theground, mounted the horses and galloped off as fast as they could.  Theygave notice to the authorities of the first town they arrived at, notfour miles distant, and a large body of cavalry were sent outimmediately.  The effects of the medicine had been so violent that thewhole of the banditti were found near to the spot where they had drunkthe king's health, in such a state of suffering and exhaustion that theycould make no efforts to escape, and were all secured, and eventuallyhung.CHAPTER THIRTY NINE.                                                               Lausanne.I recollect some one saying, that in walking out you should never lookup in the air, but always on the ground, as, by the former practice, youwere certain never to find any thing, although you might by the latter.So if you will not enter into conversation, you are not likely to obtainmuch information; whereas if you do, you will always chance to obtainsome, even from the quarters the least promising.  I was seated on thebox of the carriage, with the Swiss _voiturier_--and asked him, "If itwere not a lucrative profession?""It may appear so to you, sir," replied he, "from the price paid for thehorses, but it is not so.  All we gain, is in five months in the year;the seven months of winter, we have to feed our horses withoutemployment for them, that is, generally speaking.""But have you no employment for them in the winter?""Yes, we put them into the waggons and draw wood and stone, which aboutpays their expenses.  If you are known and trusted, you will be employedto transport wine, which is more profitable; but that _voiturier_ whocan find sufficient employment for his horses during the winter to paytheir keeping, considers himself very fortunate.""When you do make money, what do you do with it?""If we can buy a bit of land we do, but most people, if they can, buy ahouse, which pays better.  I prefer land.""There is not much territory in Switzerland, and land is not often forsale.  Everybody cannot buy land.  What do the others do?""Lock the money up in their chests.""But do you never put your money in the foreign funds?""Yes, the rich do and those who understand it.  We have a few very richpeople in Switzerland, but, generally speaking, the people do not liketo part with their money, and they keep it by them.""I was told by a Frenchman at Basle, that there was a great deal ofbullion lying idle in Switzerland?""He told you very true, sir; there is an enormous quantity of it, ifcollected together.  Those are Jews," continued he, pointing to a_char-a-banc_ passing."Have you many of those in Switzerland?  I should think not.""No, sir, we do not allow them.  One or two families are perhapspermitted in a large town, but no more.  We are a small country, and ifwe were to allow the Jews to settle here, we should soon have too largea population to support.  By their customs, they may marry at any age,and they never go into the field, and work at the plough.""But may not you marry at any age, and when you please?""No, sir; we have good laws in that respect, and it prevents thepopulation increasing too fast.  I belong to a commune (parish); if Iwish to marry, I must first prove that all my debts are paid, and all myfather's debts, and then the commune will permit the Cure to marry me.""All your father's debts as well as your own?""That is to say, all the debts he may have incurred to the commune.Suppose my father had been a poor man and unable to work, the communewould have let him want for nothing; but in supplying him they wouldhave incurred an expense, that must be repaid by his family before anyof the sons are allowed to marry.  In the same way, when my father died,although he received no assistance from the commune, he left little ornothing.  The commune clothed and educated me till I was able to gain myown livelihood.  Since I have done well, I have repaid the debt; I nowmay marry if I choose.""But cannot you evade this law?""No, sir.  Suppose I was at Berne, and wished to marry a woman whobelonged to another commune as well as myself.  The banns must bepublished three times in my parish, three times in her parish, and threetimes at Berne.""But suppose you married in a foreign country?""If a Swiss marries in a foreign country, and has no debts to preventhis marrying, he must write home to the heads of the commune, statinghis intention, and his banns will then be published in the commune, anda license sent him to marry.  But if, having debts of your own or yourfather's, you marry without giving notice, you are then no longerbelonging to the commune, and if you come back in distress, you will beconveyed to the confines of the republic, and advised to seek the parishof your wife in her country.  If you are out of Switzerland with yourwife, every child that you have born you must give notice of by letterto the commune, that it may be properly registered; and if you omit sodoing, those children have no claim on their return."Such was the result of our conversation, and I repeat it for the benefitof those who occupy themselves with our internal legislation.I have been searching a long while for liberty, but I can find hernowhere on this earth: let me be allegorical.  If all the world arestill in love with the name of Liberty, how much more were all the worldin love with the nymph herself when she first made her appearance onearth.  Every one would possess her, and every one made the attempt, butLiberty was not to be caught.  How was it possible without herdestruction?  After being harassed all over the world, and finding thatshe never was allowed to take breath, she once more fled from herpursuers, and, as they seized her garments, with the spring of thechamois she burst away, and bounding from the world, saved herself inEther, where she remains to this day.  Her dress was, however, leftbehind, and was carried home in triumph.  It is, however, composed ofsuch slippery materials as its former owner, and it escapes as itpleases from one party to another.  It is this dress of Liberty which wenow reverence as the goddess herself, and whatever is clothed with itfor the time receives the same adoration as would have been offered upto the true shrine.  Even Despotism, when in a very modest mood, willclothe herself in the garb of Liberty.Now there is really a sort of petty despotism in these _free_ cantons,which would be considered very offensive in England.  What would anEnglish farmer say, if he was told that he could not commence hisharvest without the permission of Government?  Yet such is the case inSwitzerland, where there is a heavy fine if any one commences hisvintage before the time prescribed by the authorities.  Your grapes maybe ripe, and be spoiled; you have to choose between that alternative, orpaying a fine, which reduces your profits to _nil_.  The reason givenfor this is that there are so many petty proprietors holding half andquarter acres of vineyards mixed together and not separated by a wall orfence, that if one began first he would rob the vineyard of the other--not arguing much for the Swiss honesty, which has become so proverbial.The case of the vintage laws is peculiarly hard this season upon thesmall proprietors.  The vintage has been late, and winter has now setin, all at once.  After weather like summer, we are now deep in snow,and the thermometer below the freezing point.  Few of the smallproprietors have wine-presses; they have to wait until those who havethem have got in their vintage, and then they borrow them.  Theconsequence is, that the small proprietors are always the last to gathertheir grapes, and now they have been overtaken by the weather, and theywill lose most of their harvest.  Had they been permitted to pick theirgrapes at their own time, they might have used the presses, and havefinished before the large vineyards had commenced.From the inquiries I have made, it appears that the vineyards ofSwitzerland pay very badly.  Land is at a very high price here, in theCanton de Vaud; 300 or 400 pounds per acre is not thought dear (600pounds have been given); and in the best seasons a vineyard will notyield 10 pounds per acre.  The wine is very indifferent, and requires tobe kept for years to become tolerable.But the Swiss are wedded to their vineyards; and although, if they laiddown the land in pasture, they would gain twice as much, they prefer thespeculation of the wine-press, which fails at least three times out offour.The office of public executioner or Jack Ketch of a canton inSwitzerland, as well as in many parts of Germany, is very appropriatelyendowed.  He has a right to all animals who die a natural death, withtheir skins, hoofs, etcetera, and this, it is said, brings in a fairrevenue, if attended to.  Executions are so uncommon in Switzerland,that Jack Ketch would starve if he was not thus associated with death.When an execution does take place he is well paid; they say the sum hereceives is upwards of twenty pounds; but it must be remembered that hedoes not hang, he decapitates, and this requires some address: themalefactor is seated in a chair, not laid down with his head on theblock.An execution took place at Berne when I was last in Switzerland; thecriminal, after he was seated in the chair, was offered a cup of coffee,and as he was drinking it, the executioner, with one blow of his heavysword, struck his head clear off; for a second or two the blood flew uplike a fountain: the effect was horrid.An Englishman at Lausanne had a very favourite Newfoundland dog, whichdied.  He was about to bury it, when the executioner interfered andclaimed the skin; and it was not until he had submitted to the demandsof this official gentleman, that he was permitted to bury his favouritein a whole skin.  Only imagine, half a dozen old dowagers of Park Lane,whose puffy lap-dogs were dead in their laps, bargaining for theirdarlings with Jack Ketch, because they wish to have them stuffed; andJack's extortion raising his demands, in proportion to the valueapparently placed upon the defunct favourites.  Talking about lap-dogs,one of the best stories relative to these creatures is to be found inMadame de Crequey's Memoirs.  A Madame de Blot, a French dandysette, ifthe term may be used, who considered her own sex as bound to beethereal, and would pretend that the wing of a lark was more thansufficient for her sustenance during the twenty-four hours, had one ofthe smallest female spaniels that was ever known.  She treated her likea human being, and when she went out to a party, used to desire herlady's maid to read the animal a comedy in five acts, to amuse it duringher absence.  It so happened that a fat priest, who was anxious for theprotection of Madame de Blot, called to pay his respects.  Madame deBlot made a sign to him, without speaking, to take his seat upon a largefauteuil.  No sooner had the priest lowered down his heavy carcass intothe chair, than he felt something struggling under him, and a littlerecollection told him that it must be the little spaniel.  That it wasall over with the spaniel was clear, and that if her mistress haddiscovered his accident, it was equally clear that it was all over withhim, as far as the patronage of Madame de Blot was concerned.  Thepriest showed a remarkable degree of presence of mind upon this tryingoccasion.  He rose himself up a little from his chair and plumped down,so as to give the poor little spaniel her _coup de grace_, and thenentered into conversation with Madame de Blot.  During the conversationhe contrived by degrees to cram the dog, tail and all, into hiscapacious coat pockets.  As soon as it was fairly out of sight, he rose,bade adieu to Madame de Blot, and backed out of the room with as greatrespect as if he was in the presence of royalty, much to thesatisfaction of Madame de Blot, who was delighted at such homage, andlittle thought why the good priest would not turn his back to her.  Thestory says, that the Madame de Blot never could find out what had becomeof her little dog.CHAPTER FORTY.                                                               Lausanne.What a continual strife there is between literary men!  I can onlycompare the world of authors to so many rats drowning in a tub, forcingeach other down to raise themselves, and keep their own heads abovewater.  And yet they are very respectable, and a very useful body ofmen, also, in a politico-economical sense of the word, independent ofthe advantages gained by their labours, by the present and the future;for their capital is _nothing_ except brains, and yet they contrive tofind support for themselves and thousands of others.  It is strange whenwe consider how very few, comparatively speaking, are the number ofauthors, how many people are supported by them.There are more than a thousand booksellers and publishers in the threekingdoms, all of whom rent more than a thousand houses, paying rent andtaxes; support more than a thousand families, and many thousand clerks,as booksellers alone.  Then we have to add the paper manufacturers, thevarieties of bookbinders, printing-ink manufacturers, iron pens, andgoose quills.  All of which are subservient to and dependent upon thesecomparatively few heads.What a _train_ an author has! unfortunately for him it is too long.There are too many dependent upon him, and, like some potentates, thesupport of his state eats his whole revenue, leaving him nothing butbread and cheese and fame.  Some French writer has said, "La litteratureest le plus noble des loisirs, mais le dernier de tous les metiers;" andso it is, for this one reason, that according as an author's wants arecogent, so he is pressed down by the publisher.  Authors and publishersare natural enemies, although they cannot live without each other.  Ifan author is independent of literature, and has a reputation, he bulliesthe publisher: he is right; he is only revenging the insults contumelyheaped upon those whom the publishers know to be in their power, andobliged to submit to them.  Well, every dog has his day, and the timewill come when I and others, having swam too long, shall find youngerand fresher competitors, who will, like the rats, climb on our backs,and we shall sink to the bottom of the tub of oblivion.  Now, we mustdrive on with the stream; the world moves on so fast, that there is nostopping.  In these times, "Si on n'avance pas, on recule."How the style of literature changes!  Even now I perceive an alterationcreeping on, which will last for a time.  We are descending to thehomely truth of Tenier's pictures.Every work of fiction now is "sketched from nature;" the palaces, thesaloon, all the elegancies of high life are eschewed, and the middle andvulgar classes are the subjects of the pencil.  But this will not lastlong.  It is the satiety of refinement on the part of the public whichfor a short time renders the change palatable.I was yesterday informed that a celebrated author wished to beintroduced to me.  I was ashamed to say that I had never heard his name.The introduction took place, and there was a sort of patronising air onthe gentleman's part, which I did not approve of.  I therefore told himvery frankly that I was not aware of the nature of his literary labours,and requested to know what were his works.  He had _abridged_ something,and he had written a _commentary_ upon another thing!--just theemployment fit for some old gentleman who likes still to puddle a littlewith ink.  One could write a commentary upon any thing.  One of mychildren is singing a nursery song, now I'll write a commentary on it inthe shape of notes:--  Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?  I've been to London to see the new queen.  Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you there?  Hunted a titty mouse under the chair.Now for a commentary:--This simple nursery rhyme is in the familiar style of question andanswer, which is always pleasing; and it is remarkable that twoexcellent moral lessons are to be found in so few words.The child who sings it may be supposed to repeat the words withoutcomprehending their full meaning; but although such may be the case,still it is most important that even the rhymes put into the infantinelips should afford an opportunity to those who watch over their welfareto point out to them on a proper occasion the instruction which theycontain.  In the first line, the term pussy cat may be consideredtautological, as pussy and cat both refer to the same animal; but if so,it is allowable, as pussy may be considered as the christian name andcat as the surname of the animal.  It is to be presumed that the cataddressed is young, for it evidently was at play, and old cats do notplay.  Otherwise it would not have been necessary to repeat her name, tocall her attention to the question.  The cat answers in few words, as ifnot wishing to be interrupted, that she has been to London to see thenew queen.  What queen of England may be referred to, it is impossibleto positively ascertain; but as she says the new queen, we have a rightto suppose that it must refer to the accession of a queen to the throneof England.  We have here to choose between three,--Elizabeth, Mary, andAnne; and for many reasons, particularly as the two last were married,we are inclined to give the preference to the first, the word _new_having, for the sake of the metre, been substituted for virgin.  Certainit is that a married woman cannot be considered as _new_, although shemay not be old.  We therefore adhere to our supposition that this rhymewas composed at the accession of the great Elizabeth.  And here we mayobserve, that the old adage "that a cat may look at the king" is fullycorroborated, for pussy says expressly that she has been to see the newqueen, pointing out, that as the sun shines upon all alike, so the sunof royalty, in a well-administered government, will equally dispense itssmiles upon all who approach to bask in them; and that even a cat is notconsidered as unworthy to look upon that gracious majesty who feels thatit is called to rule over so many millions, for the purpose of makingthem happy.It would appear as if the cat continued to play with her ball, orwhatever else might have been its amusements, after having answered thefirst question; for, on the second question being put, her attention isobliged to be again roused by the repetition of her name.  She is askedwhat she did there, and the reply is, that she hunted a titty mouseunder the chair.  There is a wonderful effect in this last line, whichfully gives us at once the nature and disposition of the cat, and a veryexcellent moral lesson.  The cat calls the mouse a _titty_ mouse, a termof endearment applied to the very animal that she was putting in bodilyfear.  It is well known how cats will play with a mouse in the mostgraceful way; you would almost imagine, from the manner in which it istossed so lightly and so elegantly, allowed to escape and then caughtagain, that it was playing with it in all amity, instead of prolongingits miseries and torturing it, previously to its ultimate destruction.It is in reference to this peculiar character of the cat, that she ismade to use the fond diminutive appellation of titty mouse.The moral contained in this last line hardly needs to be pointed out toour intelligent readers.  A cat goes to court, she enters the precinctsof a palace, at last she is in the presence of royalty, not as usual inthe kitchen, or the cellar, or the attics, or on the roofs, where catsdo most congregate, but actually stands in the presence of royalty; andwhat does she do?  Notwithstanding the awe which it may be naturallysupposed she is inspired with, notwithstanding the probable presence ofnoble lords and ladies, forgetful of where she is, and in whose presenceshe stands, seeing a mouse under the chair, she can no longer controlthe powerful instincts of her nature; and forgetting that the object ofher journey was to behold royalty, she no longer thinks of any thing buthunting the titty mouse under the chair.  What a lesson is here taughtto the juvenile sexes that we should never attempt to force ourselvesabove our proper situations in society, and that in so doing we soonprove how much we are out of our place, and how our former habits andpursuits will remain with us, and render us wholly unfit for a positionto which we ought never to have aspired.CHAPTER FORTY ONE.                                                               Lausanne.After all, there is more sympathy in this world than we would suppose,and it is something to find that, in the turmoil and angry war ofopinion and interest, nations as well as parties can lay down theirweapons for a time, and offer one general and sincere tribute to genius.In these exciting times, we hear of revolutions in Spain and Portugal,deaths of crowned men, with indifference, but a shock as astounding asthat of an earthquake in the city of Peru was felt throughout Europewhen the numerous periodicals spread the unexpected intelligence thatthe gifted Malibran was no more, that in the fulness of her talent andher beauty, just commencing the harvest ripe and abundant, produced byyears of unremitting labour, in which art had to perfect nature, she hadbeen called away to the silent tomb, and that voice which haselectrified so many thousands was mute for ever.  Poor Malibran! she hadhad but a niggard portion of happiness in this world, although sheprocured so much pleasure to others.  A brutal father, from whom shereceived but blows, who sold her to a dotard, who would have sold heragain would she have consented! until her late marriage, toiling forothers, without one object in the world on whom to throw her warmaffections.  I remember one day when we were talking of seasickness, Iobserved that the best remedy was beating the sufferer: she shook herhead."No," said she; "that will not cure it, or surely I should have beencured when I crossed the Atlantic with my father."Those who knew Malibran only as a performer did not know enough of her;they should have known her in society, and in domestic life.  She wasthe _ne plus ultra_ of genius in a woman; one moment all sunshine, thenext a cloud would come over her expressive features; changeable as thewind, but in every change delightful, for she never disguised a thought.Six weeks--but six short weeks, and I saw her at Brussels at hercountry house, whither she had retired after the fatigues of the season.How impressive must be her death.  Had she sickened and died atBrussels, the shock would have been great, for it is a shock when youth,beauty, and talent are so suddenly mowed down; but she died, as it were,on the stage.  Admiring and applauding thousands had been listening toher magical powers, thousands more waiting to hear her at the otherfestivals; all eyes were upon her, all expectation upon tiptoe, whendeath, like a matador, comes in, strikes his victim, bows sarcasticallyto the audience, and retires.  A thousand sermons, and ten thousandcommon deaths could not have produced so effective a moral lesson as theuntimely fate of Malibran.  There is but one parallel to it, and theeffect of it was tremendous.  It was that of Mr Huskisson, on theopening of the Manchester Railroad.  This is the second homily read tothe good people of Liverpool and Manchester.  Peace be with her,although her body is not permitted to be at rest.The more I see of the Swiss and Switzerland, the more is my opinionconfirmed as to the strongest feature in the national character beingthat of avarice.  The country is poetry, but the inhabitants are theprose of human existence.  Not a chalet but looks as the abode ofinnocence and peace; but whether you scale the beetling rock, or pauseupon the verdant turf which encircles their picturesque habitations, thedemon appears like Satan in the garden of Eden.  The infant, radiant aslove, extends its little hand for money; the adult, with his keen greyeye, searches into you to ascertain in what manner he may overreach you.Avarice rules over the beautiful country of Helvetia.The prevailing foible of a nation is generally to be found in theproverbs of the country and of those adjacent.  The Genevese appear tohave the credit of excelling the Swiss generally: they say here, "Ilfaut trois Juifs pour faire un Baslois, et trois Baslois pour faire unGenevois."Again:--"Si un Genevois se jette par la fenetre, suivez le?  Il y aura pourgagner."It was, however, a very neat answer given by a Swiss to a Frenchman, whoasserted that the French fought for honour, and the Swiss for money."C'est vrai," replied the Swiss, "chacun se bat pour cela que luimanque."The Swiss have abolished titles, they have crushed their nobility; buthuman nature will prevail; and they seek distinction by other channels;every one who has the least pretention to education or birth looks outfor employment under government; and you can hardly meet with awell-dressed person in the streets who is not a magistrate, inspector,_directeur_, or _employe_ in some way or the other, although theemoluments are little or nothing.  The question has been brought forwardas to trial by jury being introduced, and, strange to say, the majorityare opposed to it as not being suitable to the Swiss.  The reason theygive is, that as all respectable people hold offices under Government,and are thereby excused from serving, that there will be nobody but thelower classes to sit as jurors.  It is very difficult to obtain evidencein a Swiss court of justice; and this arises from the dislike of theSwiss to give evidence; as, by so doing, they may make enemies, andtheir own interests may be injured.  This is completely the character ofthe Swiss.  When I visited Switzerland in my younger days, I used myeyes only, and I was delighted; now that I visit it again, when yearshave made me reflect and inquire more, I am disappointed.  The charm isdissolved, the land of liberty appears to me to be a land of pettytyranny in the Government, and of extreme selfishness in theindividuals; even the much-vaunted fidelity of the Swiss seems not tohave arisen from any other than mercenary motives.  Indeed, there issomething radically wrong--however faithful they may be to theiremployers, or however they may be brave and talented--in the hearts ofthose who volunteer for hire and pay to kill their fellow creatures.  Icould not put my trust in such men in private life, although I would inthe service for which they have hired themselves.Do the faults of this people arise from the peculiarity of theirconstitutions, or from the nature of their Government?  To ascertainthis, one must compare them with those who live, under similarinstitutions.I must go to America, that's decided.CHAPTER FORTY TWO.SOUTH WEST AND BY WEST THREE-QUARTERS WEST.Jack Littlebrain was, physically considered, as fine grown, and moreoveras handsome a boy as ever was seen, but it must be acknowledged that hewas not very clever.  Nature is, in most instances, very impartial; shehas given plumage to the peacock, but, as every one knows, not theslightest ear for music.  Throughout the feathered race it is almostinvariably the same; the homeliest clad are the finest songsters.  Amonganimals the elephant is certainly the most intelligent, but, at the sametime he cannot be considered as a beauty.  Acting upon this wellascertained principle, nature imagined, that she had done quite enoughfor Jack when she endowed him with such personal perfection; and did notconsider it was at all necessary that he should be very clever; indeed,it must be admitted, not only that he was not very clever, but (as thetruth must be told) remarkably dull and stupid.  However, theLittlebrains have been for a long while a well-known, numerous, andinfluential family, so that, if it were possible that Jack could havebeen taught anything, the means were forthcoming: he was sent to everyschool in the country; but it was in vain.  At every following vacation,he was handed over from the one pedagogue to the other, of those whosenames were renowned for the Busbian system of teaching by stimulatingboth ends: he was horsed every day and still remained an ass, and at theend of six months, if he did not run away before that period was over,he was invariably sent back to his parents as incorrigible andunteachable.  What was to be done with him?  The Littlebrains had alwaysgot on in the world, somehow or another, by their interest andconnections; but here was one who might be said to have no brains atall.  After many pros and cons, and after a variety of consultingletters had passed between the various members of his family, it wasdecided that, as his maternal uncle, Sir Theophilus Blazers, GCB, was atthat time second in command in the Mediterranean, he should be sent tosea under his command; the Admiral, having in reply to a letter on thesubject, answered that it was hard indeed if he did not lick him intosome shape or another; and that, at all events, he'd warrant that Jackshould be able to box the compass before he had been three monthsnibbling the ship's biscuit; further, that it was very easy to get overthe examination necessary to qualify him for lieutenant, as a turkey anda dozen of brown stout in the boat with him on the passing day, as apresent to each of the passing captains, would pass him, even if he wereas incompetent as a camel (or, as they say at sea, a cable), to passthrough the eye of a needle; that having once passed, he would soon havehim in command of a fine frigate, with a good nursing first lieutenant;and that if he did not behave himself properly, he would make his signalto come on board of the flag-ship, take him into the cabin, and give hima sound horsewhipping, as other admirals have been known to inflict upontheir own sons under similar circumstances.  The reader must be awarethat, from the tenour of Sir Theophilus's letter, the circumstanceswhich we are narrating must have occurred some fifty years ago.When Jack was informed that he was to be a midshipman, he looked up inthe most innocent way in the world, (and innocent he was, sure enough,)turned on his heels, and whistled as he went for want of thought.  Forthe last three months he had been at home, and his chief employment waskissing and romping with the maids, who declared him to be thehandsomest Littlebrain that the country had ever produced.  Our heroviewed the preparations made for his departure with perfectindifference, and wished everybody good bye with the utmost composure.He was a happy, good-tempered fellow, who never calculated, because hecould not; never decided, for he had not wit enough to choose; neverforesaw, although he could look straight before him; and neverremembered, because he had no memory.  The line, "If ignorance is bliss,'tis folly to be wise," was certainly made especially for Jack;nevertheless he was not totally deficient: he knew what was good to eator drink, for his taste was perfect, his eyes were very sharp, and hecould discover in a moment if a peach was ripe on the wall; his hearingwas quick, for he was the first in the school to detect the footsteps ofhis pedagogue; and he could smell anything savoury nearly a mile off, ifthe wind lay the right way.  Moreover, he knew that if he put hisfingers in the fire that he would burn himself; that knives cutseverely; that birch tickled, and several other little axioms of thissort which are generally ascertained by children at an early age, butwhich Jack's capacity had not received until at a much later date.  Suchas he was, our hero went to sea: his stock in his sea-chest being veryabundant, while his stock of ideas was proportionably small.We will pass over all the trans-shipments of Jack until he waseventually shipped on board the Mendacious, then lying at Malta with theflag of Sir Theophilus Blazers at the fore--a splendid ship, carrying120 guns, and nearly 120 midshipmen of different calibres.  (I pass overcaptain, lieutenant, and ship's company, having made mention of her mostvaluable qualifications.)  Jack was received with a hearty welcome byhis uncle, for he came in pudding-time, and was invited to dinner; andthe Admiral made the important discovery, that if his nephew was a foolin other points, he was certainly no fool at his knife and fork.  In ashort time his messmates found out that he was no fool at his fists, andhis knock-down arguments ended each disputation.  Indeed, as the Frenchwould say, Jack was perfection in the _physique_, although so verydeficient in the _morale_.But if Pandora's box proved a plague to the whole world.  Jack had hisindividual portion of it, when he was summoned to _box_ the compass byhis worthy uncle Sir Theophilus Blazers; who in the course of six monthsdiscovered that he could not make his nephew box it in the three, whichhe had warranted in his letter; every day our hero's ears were boxed,but the compass never.  It required all the cardinal virtues to teachhim the cardinal points during the forenoon, and he made a point offorgetting them before the sun went down.  They attempted it (andvarious were the teachers employed to drive the compass into Jack'shead) his head drove round the compass; and try all he could, Jack nevercould compass it.  It appeared, as some people are said only to have oneidea, as if Jack could only have one _point_ in his head at a time, and_to_ that point he would stand like a well-broken pointer.  With him thewind never changed till the next day.  His uncle pronounced him to be afool, but that did not hurt his nephew's feelings; he had been told sotoo often already.I have said that Jack had a great respect for good eating and drinking,and, moreover, was blessed with a good appetite: every person has hispeculiar fancies, and if there was anything which more titillated thepalate and olfactory nerves of our hero, it was a roast goose with sageand onions.  Now it so happened, that having been about seven months onboard of the Mendacious, Jack had one day received a summons to dinewith the Admiral, for the steward had ordered a roast goose for dinner,and knew not only that Jack was partial to it, but also that Jack wasthe Admiral's nephew, which always goes for something on board of aflag-ship.  Just before they were sitting down to table, the Admiralwishing to know how the wind was, and having been not a little vexedwith the slow progress of his nephew's nautical acquirements, said,"Now, Mr Littlebrain, go up, and bring me down word how the wind is;and mark me, as, when you are sent, nine times out of ten you make amistake, I shall now bet you five guineas against your dinner, that youmake a mistake this time: so now be off and we will soon ascertainwhether you lose your dinner or I lose my money.  Sit down, gentlemen,we will not wait for Mr Littlebrain."Jack did not much admire this bet on the part of his uncle, but stillless did he like the want of good manners in not waiting for him.  Hehad just time to see the covers removed, to scent a whiff of the goose,and was off."The Admiral wants to know how the wind is, sir," said Jack to theofficer of the watch.The officer of the watch went to the binnacle, and setting the wind asnearly as he could, replied, "Tell Sir Theophilus that it is _South Westand by West three-quarters West_.""That's one of those confounded long points that I never can remember,"cried Jack, in despair."Then you'll `get goose,' as the saying is," observed one of themidshipmen."No; I'm afraid that I sha'n't get any," replied Jack, despondingly."What did he say, South West and by North three-quarters East?""Not exactly," replied his messmate, who was a good-natured lad, andlaughed heartily at Jack's version.  "South West and by Westthree-quarters West.""I never can remember it," cried Jack.  "I'm to have five guineas if Ido, and no dinner if I don't: and if I stay here much longer, I shallget no dinner at all events, for they are all terribly peckish, andthere will be none left.""Well, if you'll give me one of the guineas, I'll show you how to manageit," said the midshipman."I'll give you two, if you'll only be quick and the goose a'nt allgone," replied Jack.The midshipman wrote down the point from which the wind blew, at fulllength, upon a bit of paper, and pinned it to the rim of Jack's hat."Now," said he, "when you go into the cabin, you can hold your hat so asto read it, without their perceiving you.""Well, so I can; I never should have thought of that," said Jack."You hav'n't wit enough," replied the midshipman."Well I see no wit in the compass," replied Jack."Nevertheless, it's full of point," replied the midshipman: "now bequick."Our hero's eyes served him well, if his memory was treacherous and as heentered the cabin door he bowed over his hat very politely and said, ashe read it off, "South West and by West three-quarters West," and thenhe added, without reading at all, "if you please, Sir Theophilus.""Steward," said the Admiral, "tell the officer of the watch to stepdown.""How's the wind, Mr Growler?""South West and by West three-quarters West," replied the officer."Then, Mr Littlebrain, you have won your five guineas, and may now sitdown and enjoy your dinner."Our hero was not slow in obeying the order, and ventured, upon thestrength of his success, to send his plate twice for goose.  Havingeaten their dinner, drunk their wine, and taken their coffee, theofficers, at the same time, took the hint which invariably accompaniesthe latter beverage, made their bows and retreated.  As Jack wasfollowing his seniors out of the cabin, the Admiral put the sum which hehad staked into his hands, observing, that "it was an ill wind that blewnobody good."So thought Jack, who, having faithfully paid the midshipman the twoguineas for his assistance, was now on the poop keeping his watch, asmidshipmen usually do; that is, stretched out on the signal lockers, andcomposing himself to sleep after the most approved fashion, answeringthe winks of the stars by blinks of his eyes, until at last he shut themto keep them warm.  But, before he had quite composed himself, hethought of the goose and the five guineas.  The wind was from the samequarter, blowing soft and mild; Jack laid in a sort of reverie, as itfanned his cheek, for the weather was close and sultry."Well," muttered Jack to himself, "I do love that point of the compass,at all events, and I think that I never shall forget South West and byWest three-quarters West.  No I never--never liked one before, though--""Is that true?" whispered a gentle voice in his ear; "do you love `SouthWest and by West three-quarters West,' and will you, as you say, neverforget her?""Why, what's that?" said Jack, opening his eyes, and turning half roundon his side."It's me--`South West and by West three-quarters West,' that you say youlove."Littlebrain raised himself and looked round;--there was no one on thepoop except himself and two or three of the after-guard, who were lyingdown between the guns."Why, who was it that spoke?" said Jack, much astonished."It was the wind you love, and who has long loved you," replied the samevoice; "do you wish to see me?""See you,--see the wind?--I've been already sent on that message by themidshipmen," thought Jack."Do you love me as you say, and as I love you?" continued the voice."Well, I like you better than any other point of the compass, and I'msure I never thought I should like one of them," replied Jack."That will not do for me; will you love only me?""I'm not likely to love the others," replied Jack, shutting his eyesagain; "I _hate_ them all.""And love me?""Well, I do love you, that's a fact," replied Jack, as he thought of thegoose and the five guineas."Then look round, and you shall see me," said the soft voice.Jack, who hardly knew whether he was asleep or awake, did at thissummons once more take the trouble to open his eyes, and beheld a fairyfemale figure, pellucid as water, yet apparently possessing substance;her features were beautifully soft and mild, and her outline trembledand shifted as it were, waving gently to and fro.  It smiled sweetly,hung over him, played with his chestnut curls, softly touched his hipswith her own, passed her trembling fingers over his cheeks, and its warmbreath appeared as if it melted into his.  Then it grew more bold,--embraced his person, searched into his neck and collar, as if curious toexamine him.Jack felt a pleasure and gratification which he could not wellcomprehend: once more the charmer's lips trembled upon his own, nowremaining for a moment, now withdrawing, again returning to kiss andkiss again, and once more did the soft voice put the question,--"Do youlove me?""Better than goose," replied Jack."I don't know who goose may be," replied the fairy form, as she tossedabout Jack's waving locks; "you must love only me; promise me thatbefore I am relieved.""What, have you got the first watch, as well as me?" replied Jack."I am on duty just now, but I shall not be so long.  We southerly windsare never kept long in one place; some of my sisters will probably besent here soon.""I don't understand what you talk about," replied Jack.  "Suppose youtell me who you are, and what you are, and I'll do all I can to keepawake; I don't know how it is, but I've felt more inclined to go tosleep since you have been fanning me about, than I did before.""Then I will remain by your side while you listen to me.  I am, as Itold you, a wind--""That's puzzling," said Jack, interrupting her."My name is `South West and by West three-quarters West.'""Yes, and a very long name it is.  If you wish me to remember you, youshould have had a shorter one."This ruffled the wind a little, and she blew rather sharp into thecorner of Jack's eye,--however, she proceeded,--"You are a sailor, and of course you know all the winds on the compassby name.""I wish I did; but I don't," replied Littlebrain, "I can recollect you,and not one other."Again the wind trembled with delight on his lips, and sheproceeded:--"You know that there are thirty-two points on the compass,and these points are divided into quarters; so that there are, in fact,128 different winds.""There are more than I could ever remember; I know that," said Jack."Well, we are in all 128.  All the winds which have northerly in them,are coarse and ugly; all the southern winds are pretty.""You don't say so?" replied our hero."We are summoned to blow, as required, but the hardest duty generallyfalls to the northerly winds, as it should do, for they are thestrongest; although we southerly winds can--blow hard enough when wechoose.  Our characters are somewhat different.  The most unhappy indisposition, and I may say, the most malevolent, are the north andeasterly winds; the North West winds are powerful, but not unkind; theSouth East winds vary, but, at all events, we of the South West areconsidered the mildest and most beneficent.  Do you understand me?""Not altogether.  You're going right round the compass, and I nevercould make it out, that's a fact.  I hear what you say, but I cannotpromise to recollect it; I can only recollect South West and by Westthree-quarters West.""I care only for your recollecting me; if you do that, you may forgetall the rest.  Now you see we South Wests are summer winds, and areseldom required but in this season; I have often blown over your shipthese last three months, and I always have lingered near you, for Iloved you.""Thank you--now go on, for seven bells have struck sometime, and I shallbe going to turn in.  Is your watch out?""No, I shall blow for some hours longer.  Why will you leave me--whywo'n't you stay on deck with me?""What, stay on deck after my watch is out!  No, if I do, blow me!  Wemidshipmen never do that--but I say, why can't you come down with me,and turn in my hammock; it's close to the hatchway, and you can easilydo it.""Well, I will, upon one promise.  You say that you love me, now I'm veryjealous, for we winds are always supplanting one another.  Promise methat you will never mention any other wind in the compass but me, for ifyou do, they may come to you, and if I hear of it I'll blow the mastsout of your ship, that I will.""You don't say so?" replied Jack, surveying her fragile, trembling form."Yes, I will, and on a lee shore too; so that the ship shall go topieces on the rocks, and the Admiral and every soul on board her bedrowned.""No, you wouldn't, would you?" said our hero, astonished."Not if you promise me.  Then I'll come to you and pour down yourwindsails, and dry your washed clothes as they hang on the rigging, andjust ripple the waves as you glide along, and hang upon the lips of mydear love, and press him in my arms.  Promise me, then, on no accountever to recollect or mention any other wind but me.""Well, I think I may promise that," replied Jack, "I'm very clever atforgetting; and then you'll come to my hammock, won't you, and sleepwith me? you'll be a nice cool bedfellow these warm nights.""I can't sleep on my watch as midshipmen do; but I'll watch you whileyou sleep, and I'll fan your cheeks, and keep you cool and comfortable,till I'm relieved.""And when you go, when will you come again?""That I cannot tell--when I'm summoned; and I shall wait withimpatience, that you may be sure of.""There's eight bells," said Jack, starting up; "I must go down and callthe officer of the middle watch; but I'll soon turn in, for my relief isnot so big as myself, and I can thrash him."Littlebrain was as good as his word; he cut down his relief; and thenthrashed him for venturing to expostulate.  The consequence was, that inten minutes he was in his hammock, and "South West and by Westthree-quarters West" came gently down the hatchway, and rested in hisarms.  Jack soon fell fast asleep, and when he was wakened up the nextmorning by the quarter-master, his bedfellow was no longer there.  Amate inquiring how the wind was, was answered by the quartermaster thatthey had a fresh breeze from the North North West, by which Jackunderstood that his sweetheart was no longer on duty.Our hero had passed such a happy night with his soft and kind companion,that he could think of nothing else; he longed for her to come again,and, to the surprise of everybody, was now perpetually making inquiriesas to the wind which blew.  He thought of her continually; and in factwas as much in love with "South West and by West three-quarters West" ashe possibly could be.  She came again--once more did he enjoy herdelightful company; again she slept with him in his hammock, and then,after a short stay, she was relieved by another.We do not intend to accuse the wind of inconstancy, as that was not herfault; nor of treachery, for she loved dearly; nor of violence, for shewas all softness and mildness; but we do say, that "South West and byWest three-quarters West" was the occasion of Jack being very often in ascrape, for our hero kept his word; he forgot all other winds, and, withhim, there was no other except his dear "South West and by Westthree-quarters West."  It must be admitted of Jack, that, at all events,he showed great perseverance, for he stuck to his point.Our hero would argue with his messmates, for it is not those who aremost capable of arguing who are most fond of it; and, like all arguersnot very brilliant, he would flounder and diverge away right and left,just as the flaws of ideas came into his head."What nonsense it is your talking that way," would his opponent say;"why don't you come to the point?""And so I do," cried Jack."Well, then, what is your point?""South West and by West three-quarters West," replied our hero.Who could reply to this?  But in every instance, and through everydifficulty, our hero kept his promise, until his uncle Sir Theophiluswas very undecided, whether he should send him home to be locked up in aLunatic Asylum, or bring him on in the service to the rank ofpost-captain.  Upon mature consideration, however, as a man in Bedlam isa very useless member of society, and a tee-total non-productive,whereas a captain in the navy is a responsible agent, the Admiral cameto the conclusion, that Littlebrain must follow up his destiny.At last, Jack was set down as the greatest fool in the ship, and waspointed out as such.  The ladies observed, that such might possibly bethe case, but at all events he was the handsomest young man in theMediterranean fleet.  We believe that both parties were correct in theirassertions.Time flies--even a midshipman's time, which does not fly quite so fastas his money--and the time came for Mr Littlebrain's examination.  SirTheophilus, who now commanded the whole fleet, was almost in despair.How was it possible that a man could navigate a ship, with only onequarter point of the compass in his head?Sir Theophilus scratched his wig; and the disposition of theMediterranean fleet, so important to the country, was altered accordingto the dispositions of the captains who commanded the ships.  In thosedays, there were martinets in the service; officers who never overlookedan offence, or permitted the least deviation from strict duty; who weregenerally hated, but at the same time were most valuable to the service.As for his nephew passing his examination before any of those of thefirst or second, or even of the third degree, the Admiral knew that itwas impossible.  The consequence was, that one was sent away on amission to Genoa, about nothing; another to watch for vessels neverexpected, off Sardinia; two more to cruise after a French frigate whichhad never been built: and thus, by degrees, did the Admiral arrange, soas obtain a set of officers sufficiently pliant to allow his nephew tocreep under the gate which barred his promotion, and which he nevercould have vaulted over.  So the signal was made--our hero went onboard--his uncle had not forgotten the propriety of a little _douceur_on the occasion; and, as the turkeys were all gone, three couple ofgeese were sent in the same boat, as a present to each of the threepassing captains.  Littlebrain's heart failed him as he pulled to theship; even the geese hissed at him, as much as to say, "If you were notsuch a stupid ass, we might have been left alive in our coops."  Therewas a great deal of truth in that remark, if they did say so.Nothing could have been made more easy for Littlebrain than hisexamination.  The questions had all been arranged beforehand; and somekind friend had given him all the answers written down.  The passingcaptains apparently suffered from the heat of the weather, and each hadhis hand on his brow, looking down on the table at the time thatLittlebrain gave his answers, so that of course they did not observethat he was reading them off.  As soon as Littlebrain had given hisanswer, and had had sufficient time to drop his paper under the table,the captains felt better and looked up again.There were but eight questions for our hero to answer.  Seven had beensatisfactorily got through; then came the eighth, a very simpleone:--"What is your course and distance from Ushant to the Start?"  Thisquestion having been duly put, the captains were again in deepmeditation, shrouding their eyes with the palms of their hands.Littlebrain had his answer--he looked at the paper.  What could be moresimple than to reply?--and then the captains would have all risen up,shaken him by the hand, complimented him upon the talent he haddisplayed, sent their compliments to the commander-in-chief, and theirthanks for the geese.  Jack was just answering, "North--""Recollect your promise!" cried a soft voice, which Jack wellrecollected.Jack stammered--the captains were mute--and waited patiently."I must say it," muttered Jack."You shan't," replied the little Wind."Indeed I must," said Jack, "or I shall be turned back."The captains, surprised at this delay and the muttering of Jack, lookedup, and one of them gently inquired if Mr Littlebrain had not droppedhis handkerchief or something under the table!  And then they againfixed their eyes upon the green cloth."If you dare, I'll never see you again," cried "South West and by Westthree-quarters West,"--"never come to your hammock,--but I'll blow theship on shore, every soul shall be lost, Admiral and all; recollect yourpromise!""Then I shall never pass," replied Jack."Do you think that any other point in the compass shall pass you exceptme?--never!  I am too jealous for that.  Come now, dearest!" and theWind again deliciously trembled upon the lips of our hero, who could nolonger resist."South West and by West three-quarters West," exclaimed Jack firmly."You have made a slight mistake, Mr Littlebrain," said one of thecaptains.  "_Look_ again--I meant to say, _think again_.""South West and by West three-quarters West," again repeated Jack."Dearest, how I love you!" whispered the soft Wind."Why, Mr Littlebrain," said one of the captains--for Jack had actuallylaid the paper down on the table--"what's in the wind now?""She's obstinate," replied Jack."You appear to be so, at all events," replied the captain.  "Pray tryonce more.""I have it!" thought Jack, who tore off the last answer from his paper."I gained five guineas by that plan once before."  He then handed thebit of paper to the passing captain: "I believe that's right, sir," saidour hero."Yes, that is right; but could you not have said it instead of writingit, Mr Littlebrain?"Jack made no reply; his little sweetheart pouted a little, but saidnothing; it was an evasion which she did not like.  A few seconds ofconsultation then took place, as a matter of form.  Each captain askedof the other if he was perfectly satisfied as to Mr Littlebrain'scapabilities, and the reply was in the affirmative; and they wereperfectly satisfied, that he was either a fool or a madman.  However, aswe have had both in the service by way of precedent, Jack was added tothe list, and the next day was appointed lieutenant.Our hero did his duty as lieutenant of the forecastle; and as all theduty of that officer is, when hailed from the quarterdeck, to answer,"_Ay, ay, sir_," he got on without making many mistakes.  And now he wasvery happy; no one dared to call him a fool except his uncle; he had hisown cabin, and many was the time, that his dear little "South West andby West three-quarters West" would come in by the scuttle, and nestle byhis side."You won't see so much of me soon, dearest," said she one morning,gravely."Why not, my soft one?" replied Jack."Don't you recollect that the winter months are coming on?""So they are," replied Jack.  "Well, I shall long for you back."And Jack did long, and long very much, for he loved his dear wind andthe fine weather which accompanied her.  Winter came on and heavy galesand rain, and thunder and lightning; nothing but double-reefedtop-sails, and wearing in succession; and our hero walked theforecastle, and thought of his favourite wind.  The North East windscame down furiously, and the weather was bitter cold.  The officersshook the rain and spray off their garments when their watch was over,and called for grog."Steward, a glass of grog," cried one; "and let it be strong.""The same for me," said Jack; "only, I'll mix it myself."Jack poured out the rum till the tumbler was half full."Why, Littlebrain," said his messmate, "that is a dose; that's what wecall a regular _Nor-wester_.""Is it?" replied Jack.  "Well then, Nor-westers suit me exactly, and Ishall stick to them like cobblers' wax."And during the whole of the winter months our hero showed a greatpredilection for Nor-westers.It was in the latter end of February that there was a heavy gale; it hadblown furiously from the northward for three days, and then it pausedand panted as if out of breath--no wonder!  And then the wind shifted,and shifted again, with squalls and heavy rain, until it blew from everyquarter of the compass.Our hero's watch was over, and he came down and called for a"Nor-wester" as usual."How is the wind now?" asked the first lieutenant the master, who camedown dripping wet."South South West, but drawing now fast to the Westward," said oldSpunyarn.And so it was; and it veered round until "South West and by Westthree-quarters _West_," with an angry gust, came down the sky-light, andblowing strongly into our hero's ear, cried,--"Oh, you false one!""False!" exclaimed Jack.  "What! you here, and so angry too?  What's thematter?""What's the matter!--do you think I don't know?  What have you beendoing over since I was away, comforting yourself during my absence with_Nor-westers_?""Why, you an't jealous of a Nor-wester, are you?" replied Littlebrain."I confess, I'm rather partial to them.""What! this to my face!--I'll never come again, without you promise methat you will have nothing to do with them, and never call for oneagain.  Be quick--I cannot stay more than two minutes; for it is hardwork now, and we relieve quick--say the word.""Well, then," replied Littlebrain, "you've no objection to_half-and-half_?""None in the world; that's quite another thing, and has nothing to dowith the wind.""It has, though," thought Jack, "for it gets a man in the wind; but Iwon't tell her so; and," continued he, "you don't mind a raw nip, doyou?""No--I care for nothing except a Nor-wester.""I'll never call for one again," replied Jack; "it is but making my groga little stronger; in future it shall be _half-and-half_.""That's a dear!  Now I'm off--don't forget me;" and away went the windin a great hurry.It was about three months after this short visit, the fleet being offCorsica, that our hero was walking the deck, thinking that he soonshould see the object of his affections, when a privateer brig wasdiscovered at anchor a few miles from Bastia.  The signal was made forthe boats of the fleet to cut her out; and the Admiral, wishing that hisnephew should distinguish himself somehow, gave him the command of oneof the finest boats.  Now Jack was as brave as brave could be; he didnot know what danger was; he hadn't wit enough to perceive it, and therewas no doubt but he would distinguish himself.  The boats went on theservice.  Jack was the very first on board, cheering his men as hedarted into the closed ranks of his opponents.  Whether it was that hedid not think that his head was worth defending, or that he was too busyin breaking the heads of others to look after his own this is certain,that a tomahawk descended upon it with such force as to bury itself inhis skull (and his was a thick skull too).  The privateer's men wereoverpowered by numbers, and then our hero was discovered, under a pileof bodies, still breathing heavily.  He was hoisted on board, and takeninto his uncle's cabin: the surgeon shook his head when he had examinedthat of our hero."It must have been a most tremendous blow," said he to the Admiral, "tohave penetrated--""It must have been, indeed," replied the Admiral, as the tears rolleddown his cheeks; for he loved his nephew.The surgeon having done all that his art would enable him, left thecabin to attend to the others who were hurt; the Admiral also went onthe quarter-deck, walking to and fro for an hour in a melancholy mood.He returned to the cabin, and bent over his nephew; Jack opened hiseyes."My dear fellow," said the Admiral, "how's your head now?""_South West and by West three-quarters West_," faintly exclaimed ourhero, constant in death, as he turned a little on one side and expired.It was three days afterwards, as the fleet were on a wind, making forMalta, that the bell of the ship tolled, and a body, sewed up in ahammock and covered with the Union Jack, was carried to the gangway bythe Admiral's bargemen.  It had been a dull cloudy day, with littlewind; the hands were turned up, the officers and men stood uncovered;the Admiral in advance with his arms folded, as the chaplain read thefuneral service over the body of our hero,--and as the serviceproceeded, the sails flapped, for the wind had shifted a little; amotion was made, by the hand of the officer of the watch, to the man atthe helm to let the ship go off the wind, that the service might not bedisturbed, and a mizzling soft rain descended.  The wind had shifted toour hero's much loved _point_, his fond mistress had come to mourn overthe loss of her dearest, and the rain that descended were the tearswhich she shed at the death of her handsome but not over-gifted lover.CHAPTER FORTY THREE.ILL-WILL.Dramatis Personae.MR CADAVEROUS, _An old miser, very rich and very ill_.EDWARD, _A young lawyer without a brief_.MR HAUSTUS GUMARABIC, _Apothecary_.SEEDY, _Solicitor_.THOMAS MONTAGUE, JOHN MONTAGUE, _Nephews to Mr Cadaverous_.JAMES STERLING, WILLIAM STERLING, _nephews twice removed to MrCadaverous_.CLEMENTINA MONTAGU, _Niece to Mr Cadaverous_.Mrs JELLYBAGS, _Housekeeper and nurse_.------------------------------------------------------------------------ACT ONE.Scene.--_A sick room_.--Mr CADAVEROUS _in an easy chair asleep,supported by cushions, wrapped up in his dressing-gown, a night-cap onhis head.--A small table with phials, gallipots, etcetera_.--MrsJELLYBAGS _seated on a chair close to the table_.[Mrs JELLYBAGS _looks at_ Mr CADAVEROUS, _and then comes forward_.] Hesleeps yet--the odious old miser!  Mercy on me, how I do hate him,--almost as much as he loves his money! there's one comfort, he cannottake his money-bags with him, and the doctor says that he cannot lastmuch longer.  Ten years have I been his slave--ten years have I beenengaged to be married to Sergeant Major O'Callaghan of the Blues--tenyears has he kept me waiting at the porch of Hymen,--and what thousandsof couples have I seen enter during the time!  Oh dear! its enough todrive a widow mad.  I think I have managed it;--he has now quarrelledwith all his relations, and Dr Gumarabic intends this day to suggestthe propriety of his making his last will and testament.  (MrCADAVEROUS, _still asleep, coughs_.)  He is waking, (_Looks at him_.)No, he is not.  Well, then, I shall wake him, and give him a draught,for, after such a comfortable sleep as he is now in, he might last awhole week longer.  (_Goes up to_ Mr CADAVEROUS, _and shakes him_.)Mr CAD.  (_starting up_.)  Ugh ugh! ugh!  (_coughs violently_.)  Oh!Mrs Jellybags, I'm so ill.  Ugh! ugh!JEL.  My dear, dear sir! now don't say so.  I was in hopes, after such anice long sleep you would have found yourself so much better.CAD.  Long sleep! oh dear!--I'm sure I've not slept ten minutes.JEL.  (_aside_.)  I know that.  (_Aloud_.)  Indeed, my dear sir, you aremistaken.  Time passes very quick when we are fast asleep.  I have beenwatching you and keeping the flies off.  But you must now take yourdraught, my dear sir, and your pill first.CAD.  What! more pills and more draughts!  Why, there's no end to them.JEL.  Yes, there will be, by and by, my dear sir.  You know DoctorGumarabic has ordered you take one pill and one draught every half hour.CAD.  And so I have--never missed one for the last six weeks--woke upfor them day and night.  I feel very weak--very weak, indeed!  Don't youthink I might eat something, my dear Mrs Jellybags?JEL.  Eat, my dear Mr Cadaverous!--how can you ask me, when you knowthat Doctor Gumarabic says that it would be the death of you?CAD.  Only the wing of a chicken,--or a bit of the breast--JEL.  Impossible!CAD.  A bit of dry toast, then; any thing, my dear Mrs Jellybags.  I'vesuch a gnawing--Ugh! ugh!JEL.  My dear sir, you would die if you swallowed the least thing that'snourishing.CAD.  I'm sure I shall die if I do not.  Well, then, a little soup--Ishould like that very much indeed.JEL.  Soup! it would be poison, my dear sir!  No, no.  You must takeyour pill and your draught.CAD.  Oh dear! oh dear!--Forty-eight pills and forty-eight draughtsevery twenty-four hours!--not a wink of sleep day or night.JEL.  (_soothingly_.)  But it's to make you well, you know, my dear MrCadaverous.  Come, now.  (_Hands him a pill and some water in atumbler_.)CAD.  The last one is hardly down yet;--I feel it sticking half-way.Ugh! ugh!JEL.  Then wash them both down at once.  Come, now, 'tis to make youwell, you know.CADAVEROUS _takes the pill with a wry face, and coughs it up again_.CAD.  Ugh! ugh!  There--it's up again.  Oh dear! oh dear!JEL.  You must take it, my dear sir.  Come, now, try again.CAD.  (_coughing_.)  My cough is so bad.  (_Takes the pill_.)  Oh, mypoor head!  Now I'll lie down again.JEL.  Not yet, my dear Mr Cadaverous.  You must take your draught;--it's to make you well, you know.CAD.  What! another draught?  I'm sure I must have twenty draughts in myinside, besides two boxes of pills!JEL.  Come, now--it will be down in a minute.[CADAVEROUS _takes the wine-glass in his hand, and looks at it withabhorrence_.]JEL.  Come, now.[CADAVEROUS _swallows the draught, and feels very sick, puts hishandkerchief to his mouth, and, after a time, sinks back in the chairquite exhausted, and shuts his eyes_.]JEL.  (_aside_.)  I wish the doctor would come.  It's high time that hemade his will.CAD.  (_drawing up his leg_.)  Oh! oh! oh!JEL.  What's the matter, my dear Mr Cadaverous.CAD.  Oh! such pain!--oh! rub it, Mrs Jellybags.JEL.  What, here, my dear sir?  (_Rubs his knee_.)CAD.  No, no!--Not there!--Oh, my hip!JEL.  What, here?  (_Rubs his hip_.)CAD.  No, no!--higher--higher!  Oh, my side!JEL.  What, here?  (_Rubs his side_.)CAD.  No!--lower!JEL.  Here?  (_Rubbing_.)CAD.  No!--higher!--Oh, my chest!--my stomach!  Oh dear!--oh dear!JEL.  Are you better now, my dear sir?CAD.  Oh dear! oh!  I do believe that I shall die!  I've been a verywicked man, I'm afraid.JEL.  Don't say so, Mr Cadaverous.  Every one but your nephews andnieces say that you are the best man in the world.CAD.  Do they?  I was afraid that I had not been quite so good as theythink I am.JEL.  I'd like to hear any one say to the contrary.  I'd tear their eyesout,--that I would.CAD.  You are a good woman, Mrs Jellybags; and I shall not forget youin my will.JEL.  Don't mention wills, my dear sir.  You make me so miserable.(_Puts her handkerchief to her eyes_.)CAD.  Don't cry, Mrs Jellybags.  I won't talk any more about it.(_Sinks back exhausted_.)JEL.  (_wiping her eyes_.)  Here comes Dr Gumarabic._Enter_ GUMARABIC.GUM.  Good morning, Mistress Jellybags.  Well, how's our patient?--better?--heh?[Mrs JELLYBAGS _shakes her head_.]GUM.  No: well, that's odd.  (_Goes up to_ Mr CADAVEROUS.)  Not better,my dear sir?--don't you feel stronger?CAD.  (_faintly_.)  Oh, no!GUM.  Not stronger!  Let us feel the pulse.  [Mrs JELLYBAGS _hands achair, and_ GUMARABIC _sits down, pulls out his watch, and counts_.]Intermittent--135--well, now--that's very odd!  Mrs Jellybags, have youadhered punctually to my prescriptions?JEL.  Oh yes, sir, exactly.GUM.  He has eaten nothing?CAD.  Nothing at all.GUM.  And don't feel stronger?  Odd--very odd!  Pray, has he had anything in the way of drink?  Come, Mrs Jellybags, no disguise,--tell thetruth;--no soup--warm jelly--heh?JEL.  No, sir; upon my word, he has had nothing.GUM.  Humph?--and yet feels no stronger?  Well, that's odd!--Has hetaken the pill every half-hour?JEL.  Yes, sir, regularly.GUM.  And feels no better!  Are you sure that he has had his draughtwith his pill?JEL.  Every time, sir.GUM.  And feels no better!  Well, that's odd!--very odd, indeed!(_Rises and comes forward with_ Mrs JELLYBAGS.)  We must throw in somemore draughts, Mrs Jellybags; there is no time to be lost.JEL.  I am afraid he's much worse, sir.GUM.  I am not at all afraid of it, Mrs Jellybags,--I am sure of it;--it's very odd,--but the fact is, that all the physic in the world won'tsave him; but still he must take it,--because--physic was made to betaken.JEL.  Very true, sir.  (_Whispers to_ GUMARABIC.)GUM.  Ah! yes;--very proper.  (_Going to_ Mr CADAVEROUS.)  My dear sir,I have done my best; nevertheless, you are ill,--very ill,--which isodd,--very odd!  It is not pleasant,--I may say, very unpleasant,--butif you have any little worldly affairs to settle,--will to make,--or acodocil to add, in favour of your good nurse, your doctor, or so on,--itmight be as well to send for your lawyer;--there is no saying, but,during my practice, I have sometimes found that people die.  After allthe physic you have taken, it certainly is odd--very odd--very odd,indeed;--but you might die to-morrow.CAD.  Oh dear!--I'm very ill.JEL.  (_sobbing_.)  Oh dear! oh dear!--he's very ill.GUM.  (_comes forward, shrugging up his shoulders_.)  Yes; he is ill--very ill;--to-morrow, dead as mutton!  At all events he has not died forwant of physic.  We must throw in some more draughts immediately;--notime to be lost.  Life is short,--but my bill will be long--very long!                                               [_Exit as scene closes_.]------------------------------------------------------------------------Act 2.SCENE 1.--_Enter_ CLEMENTINA, _with a letter in her hand_.CLEM.  I have just received a letter from my dear Edward: he knows of myuncle's danger, and is anxious to see me.  I expect him immediately.  Ihope he will not be seen by Mrs Jellybags as he comes in, for she wouldtry to make more mischief than than she has already.  Dear Edward! howhe loves me!  (_Kisses the letter_.)_Enter_ EDWARD.EDW.  My lovely, my beautiful, my adored Clementina!  I have called uponMr Gumarabic, who tells me that your uncle cannot live through thetwenty-four hours, and I have flown here, my sweetest, dearest, to--to--CLEM.  To see me, Edward: surely there needs no excuse for coming?EDW.  To reiterate my ardent, pure, and unchangeable affection, mydearest Clementina to assure you, that in sickness or in health, forricher or for poorer, for better or for worse, as they say in themarriage ceremony, I am yours till death us do part.CLEM.  I accept the vow, dearest Edward.  You know too well my heart forme to say more.EDW.  I do know your heart, Clementina, as it is,--nor do I think itpossible that you could change;--still, sometimes--that is for a momentwhen I call to mind that, by your uncle's death, as his favourite niece,living with him for so many years, you may soon find yourself inpossession of thousands,--and that titled men may lay their coronets atyour feet,--then, Clementina--CLEM.  Ungenerous and unkind!--Edward, I almost hate you.  Is a littlemoney, then, to sway my affections?  Shame, Edward, shame on you!  Issuch your opinion of my constancy?  (_Weeps_.)  You must judge me byyour own heart.EDW.  Clementina! dearest Clementina!--I did!--but rather--that is,--Iwas not in earnest;--but when we value any object as I value you,--itmay be forgiven, if I feel at times a little jealous;--yes, dearest,jealous!CLEM.  'Twas jealousy then, Edward, which made you so unkind?  Well,then, I can forgive that.EDW.  Nothing but jealousy, dearest!  I cannot help, at times,representing you surrounded by noble admirers,--all of them suing toyou,--not for yourself, but for your money, tempting you with theirrank;--and it makes me jealous, horribly jealous!  I cannot compete withlords, Clementina,--a poor barrister without a brief.CLEM.  I have loved you for yourself, Edward.  I trust you have done thesame toward me.EDW.  Yes; upon my soul, my Clementina!CLEM.  Then my uncle's disposition of his property will make nodifference in me.  For your sake, my dear Edward, I hope he will notforget me.  What's that?  Mrs Jellybags is coming out of the room.Haste, Edward;--you must not be seen here.  Away, dearest!--and may Godbless you.EDW.  (_kisses her hand_.)  Heaven preserve my adored, my matchless,ever-to-be-loved Clementina.                                                  [_Exeunt separately_.]------------------------------------------------------------------------SCENE 2.--_The sick room_--Mr CADAVEROUS, _lying on sofa-bed_--MrSEEDY, _the lawyer, sitting by his side, with papers on the table beforehim_.SEEDY.  I believe now, sir, that every thing is arranged in your willaccording to your instructions.  Shall I read it over again; foralthough signed and witnessed, you may make any alteration you please bya codicil.CAD.  No, no.  You have read it twice, Mr Seedy, and you may leave menow.  I am ill, very ill, and wish to be alone.SEEDY (_folds up his papers and rises_.)  I take my leave, MrCadaverous, trusting to be long employed as your solicitor.CAD.  Afraid not, Mr Seedy.  Lawyers have no great interest in heaven.Your being my solicitor will not help me there.SEEDY (_coming forward as he goes out_.)  Not a sixpence to his legaladviser!  Well, well!  I know how to make out a bill for the executors.                             [_Exit_ SEEDY, _and enter_ Mrs JELLYBAGS.]JEL.  (_with her handkerchief to her eyes_.)  Oh dear! oh dear! oh, MrCadaverous, how can you fatigue and annoy yourself with such things aswills?CAD.  (_faintly_.)  Don't cry, Mrs Jellybags.  I've not forgotten you.JEL.  (_sobbing_.)  I can't--help--crying.  And there's MissClementina,--now that you are dying,--who insists upon coming in to seeyou.CAD.  Clementina, my niece, let her come in, Mrs Jellybags; I feel I'mgoing fast,--I may as well take leave of every body.JEL.  (_sobbing_.)  Oh dear! oh dear!  You may come in, Miss._Enter_ CLEMENTINA.CLEM.  My dear uncle, why have you, for so many days, refused meadmittance?  Every morning have I asked to be allowed to come and nurseyou, and for more than three weeks have received a positive refusal.CAD.  Refusal!  Why I never had a message from you.CLEM.  No message!  Every day I have sent, and every day did MrsJellybags reply that you would not see me.CAD.  (_faintly_.)  Mrs Jellybags,--Mrs Jellybags--CLEM.  Yes, uncle; it is true as I stand here;--and my brother Thomashas called almost every day, and John every Sunday, the only day he canleave the banking-house; and cousins William and James have both beenhere very often.CAD.  Nobody told me!  I thought every one had forgotten me.  Why was Inot informed, Mrs Jellybags?JEL.  (_in a rage_.)  Why, you little, story-telling creature, cominghere to impose upon your good uncle!  You know that no one has beenhere--not a soul;--and as for yourself, you have been too busy lookingafter a certain gentleman ever to think of your poor uncle;--that youhave;--taking advantage of his illness to behave in so indecorous amanner.  I would have told him every thing, but I was afraid of makinghim worse.CLEM.  You are a false, wicked woman!JEL.  Little impudent creature,--trying to make mischief between me andmy kind master, but it won't do.  (_To_ CLEMENTINA _aside_.)  The willis signed, and I'll take care he does not alter it;--so do your worst.CAD.  (_faintly_.)  Give me the mixture, Mrs --CLEM.  I will, dear uncle.  (_Pours out the restorative mixture in aglass_.)JEL.  (_going back_.)  You will, Miss,--indeed! but you shan't.CLEM.  Be quiet, Mrs Jellybags;--allow me at least to do something formy poor uncle.CLEM.  Give me the mix--JEL.  (_prevents_ CLEMENTINA _from giving it, and tries to take it fromher_.)  You shan't, Miss!--You never shall.CAD.  Give me the --[Mrs JELLYBAGS _and_ CLEMENTINA _scuffle, at last_ CLEMENTINA _throwsthe contents of the glass into_ Mrs JELLYBAGS'S _face_.]CLEM.  There, then!--since you will have it.JEL.  (_in a rage_.)  You little minx!--I'll be revenged for that.  Waita little till the will is read,--that's all;--See if I don't bundle youout of doors,--that I will.CLEM.  As you please, Mrs Jellybags; but pray give my poor uncle hisrestorative mixture.JEL.  To please you?--Not I!  I'll not give him a drop till I thinkproper.  Little, infamous, good-for-nothing--CAD.  Give me--oh!JEL.  Saucy--man-seeking--CLEM.  Oh! as for that, Mrs Jellybags, the big sergeant was here lastnight--I know that.  Talk of men indeed!JEL.  Very well, Miss!--very well!  Stop till the breath is out of youruncle's body--and I'll beat you till your's is also.CAD.  Give--oh!CLEM.  My poor uncle!  He will have no help till I leave the room--Imust go.  Infamous woman!  _Exit_.CAD.  Oh!JEL.  I'm in such a rage!--I could tear her to pieces!--the little!--thegnat!  Oh, I'll be revenged!  Stop till the will is read, and then I'llturn her out into the streets to starve.  Yes! yes! the will!--the will!(_Pauses and pants for breath_.)  Now, I recollect the old fellowcalled for his mixture.  I must go and get some mere.  I'll teach her tothrow physic in my face.[_Goes out and returns with a phial--pours out a portion, and goes upto_ Mr CADAVEROUS.]JEL.  Here, my dear Mr Cadaverous.  Mercy on me!--Mr Cadaverous!--why,he's fainted!--Mr Cadaverous!  (_Screams_.)  Lord help us!--why, he'sdead!  Well now, this sort of thing does give one a shock, even when onehas longed for it.  Yes, he's quite dead!  (_Coming forward_.)  So,there's an end of all his troubles--and, thank Heaven! of mine also.Now for Sergeant-major O'Callaghan, and--love!  Now for Miss Clementina,and--revenge?  But first the will!--the will!_Curtain drops_.------------------------------------------------------------------------Act 3.MRS JELLYBAGS.Oh dear!--this is a very long morning.  I feel such suspense--suchanxiety; and poor Sergeant-major O'Callaghan is quite in a perspiration!He is drinking and smoking down in the kitchen to pass away the time,and if the lawyer don't come soon, the dear man will be quite fuddled.He talks of buying a farm in the country.  Well, we shall see; but ifthe Sergeant thinks that he will make ducks and drakes of my money, heis mistaken.  I have not been three times a widow for nothing--I willhave it all settled upon myself; that must and shall be, or else--noSergeant O'Callaghan for me!_Enter_ CLEMENTINA.So, here you are, Miss.  We'll wait till the will is read, and then weshall see who is mistress here.CLEM.  I am as anxious as you, Mrs Jellybags.  You may have wheedled mypoor uncle to make up the will in your favour; if so, depend upon it, Ishall expect nothing from your hands.JEL.  I should rather think not, Miss.  If I recollect right, you threwthe carminative mixture in my face.CLEM.  And made you blush for the first time in your life.JEL.  I shall not blush to slam the door in your face.CLEM.  Rather than be indebted to you, I would beg my bread from door todoor.JEL.  I expect that you very soon will._Enter_ EDWARD.EDW.  My dearest Clementina, I have come to support you on this tryingoccasion.JEL.  And ascertain how matters stand, before you decide upon marrying,I presume, Mr Edward.EDW.  Madam, I am above all pecuniary considerations.JEL.  So everybody says, when they think themselves sure of money.EDW.  You judge of others by yourself.JEL.

I sacrifice myself--myhappiness--all for you!--banish myself from your dear presence, andretire to pass the remainder of my existence in misery and regret,maddened with the feeling that some happier mortal will obtain that dearhand, and will rejoice in the possession of those charms which I had toofondly, too credulously, imagined as certain to be mine.[_Takes out his handkerchief and covers his face_; CLEMENTINA _also putsher handkerchief to her face and weeps_.

I now absolve youfrom all your vows.  You are free.

And as for his other garments, why a Jew would hardly putthem into his bag!  (_Crying_.)  Oh dear! oh dear!  After all, I'm justlike Miss Clementina; for Sergeant O'Callaghan, when he knows all this,will as surely walk off without beat of drum, as did Mr Edward--andthat too with all the money I have lent him.

When they pretend to be in love, they only aretrying for your money; and even when they make their wills, they leaveto those behind them nothing but _ill-will_.                   [_Exit, crying, off the stage as the curtain falls_.]CHAPTER FORTY FOUR.THE SKY-BLUE DOMINO.It was a flue autumnal evening; I had been walking with a friend untildusk on the Piazza Grande, or principal square in the town of Lucca.  Wehad been conversing of England, our own country, from which I had thenbanished myself for nearly four years, having taken up my residence inItaly to fortify a weak constitution, and having remained there longafter it was requisite for my health from an attachment to its pure sky,and the _dolce far niente_ which so wins upon you in that luxuriousclimate.  We had communicated to each other the contents of ourrespective letters arrived by the last mail; had talked over politics,great men, acquaintances, friends and kindred; and, tired ofconversation, had both sank into a pleasing reverie as we watched thestars twinkling above us, when my friend rose hastily and bid me goodnight."Where are you going, Albert?" inquired I."I had nearly forgotten I had an appointment this evening.  I promisedto meet somebody at the Marquesa di Cesto's masquerade.""Pshaw! are you not tired of these things?" replied I; "that eternalround of black masks and dominos of all colours; heavy harlequins, foolsand clowns by nature wearing their proper dresses there, and only inmasquerade when out of it; nuns who have no holiness in their ideas,friars without a spice of religion, ugly Venuses, Dianas withoutchastity, and Hebes as old as your grandmother.""All very true, Herbert, and life itself is masquerade enough; but thefact is, that I have an appointment: it is of importance, and I must notfail.""Well, I wish you more amusement than I have generally extracted fromthese burlesque meetings," replied I.  "Adieu, and may you besuccessful!"  And Albert hastened away.I remained another half hour reclining on the bench, and then returnedto my lodgings.  My servant Antonio lighted the candle and withdrew.  Onthe table lay a note; it was an invitation from the Marquesa.  I threwit on one side and took up a book, one that required reflection and deepexamination; but the rattling of the wheels of the carriages as theywhirled along past my window would not permit me to command myattention.  I threw down the book; and taking a chair at the window,watched the carriages full of masks as they rolled past, apparently soeager in the pursuit of pleasure.  I was in a cynical humour.  Whatfools, thought I, and yet what numbers will be there; there will be animmense crowd; and what can be the assignation which Albert said was ofsuch consequence?  Such was my reflection for the next ten minutes,during which at least fifty carriages and other vehicles had passed inreview before me.And then I thought of the princely fortune of the Marquesa, the splendidpalazzo at which the masquerade was given, and the brilliant scene whichwould take place."The Grand Duke is to be there, and everybody of distinction in Lucca.I have a great mind to go myself."A few minutes more elapsed.  I felt that I was lonely, and I made up mymind that I would go.  I turned from the window and rang the bell."Antonio, see if you can procure me a domino, a dark-coloured one ifpossible; and tell Carlo to bring the carriage round as soon as he can."Antonio departed, and was away so long that the carriage was at the doorprevious to his return."Signor, I am sorry, very, very sorry; but I have run to every shop inLucca, and there is nothing left but a sky-blue domino, which I havebrought with me.""Sky-blue! why, there will not be two sky-blue dominos in the wholemasquerade: I might as well tell my name at once, I shall be soconspicuous.""You are as well hidden under a sky-blue domino as a black one, Signor,if you choose to keep your own secrets," observed Antonio."Very true," replied I, "give me my mask."Enshrouding myself in the sky-blue domino, I went down the stairs, threwmyself into the carriage, and directed Carlo to drive to the palazzo ofthe Marquesa.In half an hour we arrived at the entrance-gates of the Marquesa'ssuperb country seat.  From these gates to the palazzo, a sweep ofseveral hundred yards, the avenue though which the driver passed wasloaded with variegated lamps, hanging in graceful festoons from branchto branch; and the notes of music from the vast entrance-hall of thepalazzo floated through the still air.  When I arrived at the area infront of the flight of marble steps which formed the entrance of thepalazzo, I was astonished at the magnificence, the good taste, and thetotal disregard of expense which were exhibited.  The palazzo itselfappeared like the fabric built of diamonds and precious stones by thegenii who obeyed the ring and lamp of Aladdin, so completely was itsmarble front hidden with a mass of many-coloured lamps, the reflectionfrom whose galaxy of light rendered it bright as day for nearly onehundred yards around; various mottoes and transparencies were arrangedin the walks nearest to the palazzo; and then all was dark, renderedstill darker from the contrast with the flood of light which poured to acertain distance from the scene of festivity.  Groups of characters anddominos were walking to and fro in every direction; most of themretracing their steps when they arrived at the sombre walks and alleys,some few pairs only continuing their route where no listeners were to beexpected.This is an animating scene, thought I, as the carriage stopped, and I amnot sorry that I have made one of the party.  As soon as I haddescended, I walked up the flight of marble steps which led to thespacious hall in which the major part of the company were collected.The music had, for a moment, ceased to play; and finding that theperfume of the exotics which decorated the hall was too powerful, I wasagain descending the steps, when my hand was seized and warmly pressedby one in a violet-coloured domino."I am so glad that you are come; we were afraid that you would not.  Iwill see you again directly," said the domino; and it then fell backinto the crowd and disappeared.It immediately occurred to me that it was my friend Albert who spoke tome.  "Very odd," thought I, "that he should have found me out!"  Andagain I fell into the absurdity of imagining that because I had put on aconspicuous domino, I was sure to be recognised.  "What can he want withme?  We must be in some difficulty, some unexpected one, that iscertain."  Such were my reflections as I slowly descended the steps,occasionally pausing for a moment on one, as I was lost in conjecture,when I was again arrested by a slight slap on the shoulder.  I lookedround: it was a female; and although she wore her half-mask, it wasevident that she was young, and I felt convinced that she was beautiful."Not a word," whispered she, putting her finger to her lip; "follow me."Of course I followed: who could resist such a challenge?"You are late," said the incognito, when we had walked so far away fromthe palazzo as to be out of hearing of the crowd."I did not make up my mind to come until an hour ago," replied I."I was so afraid that you would not come.  Albert was sure that youwould, he was right.  He told me just now that he had spoken to you.""What! was that Albert in the rose-coloured domino?""Yes; but I dare not stay now--my father will be looking for me.  Albertis keeping him in conversation.  In half an hour he will speak to youagain.  Has he explained to you what has occurred?""Not one word.""If he has not had time--and I doubt if he will have, as he must attendto the preparations--I will write a few lines, if I can, and explain, orat least tell you what to do; but I am so harassed, so frightened!  Wedo indeed require your assistance.  Adieu!"  So saying, the fair unknowntripped hastily away."What the deuce is all this?" muttered I, as I watched her retreatingfigure.  "Albert said that he had an appointment, but he did not make mehis confidant.  It appears that something which has occurred this nightoccasions him to require my assistance.  Well, I will not fail him."For about half an hour I sauntered up and down between the lines oforange-trees which were dressed up with variegated lamps, and shed theirpowerful fragrance in the air: I ruminated upon what might be myfriend's intentions, and what might be the result of an intrigue carriedon in a country where the stiletto follows Love so close through all themazes of his labyrinth, when I was again accosted by the violet-coloureddomino."Hist!" whispered he, looking carefully round as he thrust a paper intomy hand; "read this after I leave you.  In one hour from this be you onthis spot.  Are you armed?""No," replied I; "but Albert--""You may not need it; but nevertheless take this,--I cannot wait."  Sosaying, he put a stiletto into my hand, and again made a hasty retreat.It had been my intention to have asked Albert what was his plan, andfurther why he did not speak English instead of Italian, as he wouldhave been less liable to be understood if overheard by eavesdroppers;but a little reflection told me that he was right in speaking Italian,as the English language overheard would have betrayed him, or at leasthave identified him as a foreigner."A very mysterious affair this!" thought I; "but, however, this paperwill, I presume, explain the business.  That there is a danger in it isevident, or he would not have given me this weapon;" and I turned thestiletto once or twice to the light of the lamp next to me, examiningits blade, when, looking up, I perceived a black domino standing beforeme."It is sharp enough, I warrant," said the domino; "you have but tostrike home.  I have been waiting for you in the next walk, which Ithought was to be our rendezvous.  Here is a paper which you will fastento his dress.  I will contrive that he shall be here in an hour hence bya pretended message.  After his death you will put this packet into hisbosom;--you understand.  Fail not: remember the one thousand sequins;and here is my ring, which I will redeem as soon as your work is done.The others will soon be here.  The pass-word is `Milano.'  But I mustnot be seen here.  Why a sky-blue domino? it is too conspicuous forescape;" and as I received from him the packet and ring, the blackdomino retreated through the orange grove which encircled us.I was lost in amazement: there I stood with my hands full--two papers, apacket, a stiletto, and a diamond ring!"Well," thought I, "this time I am most assuredly taken for somebodyelse--for a bravo I am not.  There is some foul work going on, whichperhaps I may prevent.""But why a sky-blue domino?" said he.I may well ask the same question.  "Why the deuce did I come here in asky-blue domino, or any domino at all?"I put the ring on my finger, the stiletto and packet in my bosom, andthen hastened away to the garden on the other side of the palazzo, thatI might read the mysterious communication put into my hands by my friendAlbert; and as I walked on, my love for admiration led me away so as tofind myself pleased with the mystery and danger attending upon theaffair; and feeling secure, now that I had a stiletto in my bosom for mydefence, I resolved that I would go right through it until the wholeaffair should be unravelled.I walked on till I had gained the last lamp on the other side of thepalazzo.  I held up to its light the mysterious paper: it was inItalian, and in a woman's handwriting.  "We have determined upon flight, as we cannot hope for safety here,  surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side.  We feel sure of  pardon as soon as the papers which Albert received by this day's mail,  and which he will entrust to you when you meet again, are placed in my  father's hands.  We must have your assistance in removing our  treasure.  Our horses are all ready, and a few hours will put us in  safety; but we must look to you for following us in your carriage, and  conveying for me what would prove so great an incumbrance to our  necessary speed.  When Albert sees you again, he will be able to tell  you where it is deposited.  Follow us quick, and you will always have  the gratitude of--  "VIOLA.  "PS.  I write in great haste, as I cannot leave my father's side for a  moment without his seeking for me.""What can all this mean?  Albert told me of no papers by this day'smail.  Viola!  I never heard him mention such a name.  He said to me,`Read this, and all will be explained.'  I'll be hanged if I am not asmuch in the dark as ever!  Follow them in my carriage with thetreasure--never says where!  I presume he is about to run off with somerich heiress.  Confound this sky-blue domino!  Here I am with twopapers, a packet, a stiletto, and a ring; I am to receive anotherpacket, and am to convey treasure.  Well, it must solve itself--I willback to my post; but first let me see what is in this paper which I amto affix upon the man's dress after I have killed him."  I held it up tothe light, and read, in capital letters, "The reward of a traitor!""Short and pithy," muttered I, as I replaced it in my pocket: "now I'llback to the place of assignation, for the hour must be nearly expired."As I retraced my steps, I again reverted to the communication ofViola--"Surrounded as we are by stilettoes on every side!"  Why, surelyAlbert cannot be the person that I am required by the black domino todespatch; and yet it may be so--and others are to join me here beforethe hour is passed.  A thought struck me: whoever the party might bewhose life was to be taken, whether Albert or another, I could save him.My reverie was again broken by a tap on the shoulder."Am I right?  What is the pass-word?""Milano!" replied I, in a whisper."All's right, then--Giacomo and Tomaso are close by--I will fetch them."The man turned away, and in a minute re-appeared with two others,bending as they forced their way under the orange-trees."Here we all are, Felippo," whispered the first.  "_He_ is to be here ina few minutes.""Hush!" replied I, in a whisper, and holding up to them the brilliantring which sparkled on my finger."Ah, Signor, I cry your mercy," replied the man, in a low voice; "Ithought it was Felippo.""Not so loud," replied I, still in a whisper.  "All is discovered, andFelippo is arrested.  You must away immediately.  You shall hear from meto-morrow.""Corpo di Bacco!  Where, Signor? at the old place?""Yes away--now, and save yourselves."In a few seconds the desperate men disappeared among the trees, and Iwas left alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------"Slaves of the Ring, you have done my bidding at all events, this time,"thought I, and I looked at the ring more attentively.  It was a splendidsolitaire diamond, worth many hundred crowns.  "Will you ever find yourway back to our lawful owner?" was the question in my mind when Albertmade his appearance in his violet-coloured domino."'Twas imprudent of you to send me the paper by the black domino," saidhe, hastily.  "Did I not tell you that I would be here in an hour?  Wehave not a moment to spare.  Follow me quickly, and be silent."I followed--the paper which Albert referred to needed no explanation; itwas, indeed, the only part of the whole affair which I comprehended.  Heled the way to about three hundred yards of the path through the wood."There," said he, "in that narrow avenue, you will find my faithfulnegro with his charge.  He will not deliver it up without you show himthis ring."  And Albert put a ring upon my finger."But, Albert,"--my mind misgave me--Albert never had a faithful negro tomy knowledge; it must be some other person who had mistaken me for hisfriend,--"I am afraid," continued I--"Afraid!--let me not hear you say that.  You never yet knew fear," saidhe, interrupting me.  "What have you to fear between this and Pisa?Your own horses will take you there in three hours.  But here's thepacket, which you must deliver yourself.  Now that you know where thenegro is, return to the palazzo, deliver it into his own hands,requesting his immediate perusal.  After that do not wait a moment, buthasten here to your charge.  While the Grand Duke is reading it I willescape with Viola.""I really cannot understand all this," said I, taking the packet."All will be explained when we meet at Pisa.  Away, now; to the GrandDuke--I will go to the negro and prepare him for your coming.""But allow me--""Not a word more, if you love me," replied the violet-coloured domino,who, I was now convinced, was not Albert; it was not his voice--therewas a mystery and a mistake; but I had become so implicated that I feltI could not retreat without sacrificing the parties, whoever they mightbe."Well," said I, as I turned back to the palazzo, "I must go on now; for,as a gentleman and man of honour, I cannot refuse.  I will give thepacket to the Grand Duke, and I will also convey his treasure to Pisa,Confound this sky-blue domino!"As I returned to the palazzo, I was accosted by the black domino."Milano!" replied I."Is all right, Felippo?" said he, in a whisper."All is right, Signor," was my answer."Where is he?"I pointed with my finger to a clump of orange-trees."And the paper and packet?"I nodded my head."Then you had better away--I will see you to-morrow.""At the old place, Signor?""Yes," replied the black domino, cutting into a cross-path, anddisappearing.I arrived at the palazzo, mounted the steps, forced my way through thecrowd, and perceived the Grand Duke in an inner saloon, the lady who hadaccosted me leaning on his arm.  It then occurred to me that the GrandDuke had an only daughter, whose name was Viola.  I entered the saloon,which was not crowded, and walking boldly up to the Grand Duke,presented the packet, requesting that his Highness would give it hisimmediate attention.  I then bowed, and hastened away, once more passedthrough the thronged hall, and gained the marble steps of the palazzo."Have you given it?" said a low voice close to me."I have," replied I; "but, Signor--""Not a word, Carlo: hasten to the wood, if you love me."  And theviolet-coloured domino forced his way into the crown which filled thehall."Now for my journey to Pisa," said I.  "Here I am, implicated in hightreason, perhaps, in consequence of my putting on a sky-blue domino.Well, there's no help for it."In a few minutes I had gained the narrow avenue, and having pursued itabout fifty yards, perceived the glaring eyes of the crouched negro.  Bythe starlight, I could just distinguish that he had a basket, orsomething like one, before him."What do you come for, Signor?" said the negro, rising on his feet."For what has been placed under your charge; here is the ring of yourmaster."The negro put his fingers to the ring and felt it, that he mightrecognise it by its size and shape."Here it is, Signor," said he, lifting up the basket gently, and puttingit into my arms.  It was not heavy, although somewhat cumbrous from itssize."Hark!  Signor, there is confusion in the palazzo.  You must be quick,and I must not be seen with you."  And away darted the negro likelightning through the bushes.I also hastened away with the basket (contents unknown), for it appearedto me that affairs were coming to a crisis.  I heard people runningdifferent ways, and voices approaching me.  When I emerged from thenarrow avenue, I perceived several figures coming down the dark walk ata rapid pace, and, seized with a sort of panic, I took to my heels.  Isoon found that they were in pursuit, and I increased my speed.  In thegloom of the night, I unfortunately tripped over a stone, and fell withthe basket to the ground; and then the screams from within informed methat the treasure intrusted to my safe keeping was a child.  Fearfulthat it was hurt, and forgetting, for the time, the danger of beingcaptured, I opened the lid, and examined its limbs, while I tried topacify it; and while I was sitting down in my sky-blue domino, thusoccupied in hushing a baby, I was seized by both shoulders, and foundmyself a prisoner."What is the meaning of this rudeness, Signors?" said I, hardly knowingwhat to say."You are arrested by order of the Grand Duke," was the reply."I am arrested!--why?--I am an Englishman!""That makes no difference; the orders are to arrest all found in thegarden in sky-blue dominos.""Confound the sky-blue domino!" thought I, for the twentieth time atleast.  "Well, Signora, I will attend you; but first let me try topacify this poor frightened infant.""Strange that he should be found running away with a child at the sametime that the Lady Viola has disappeared!" observed one of my captors."You are right, Signora," replied I; "it is very strange; and what ismore strange is, that I can no more explain it than you can.  I am nowready to accompany you.  Oblige me by one of you carrying the basketwhile I take care of the infant."In a few minutes we had arrived at the palazzo.  I had retained my mask,and I was conducted through the crowd into the saloon into which I hadpreviously entered when I delivered the packet to the Grand Duke."There he is! there he is!" was buzzed through the crowd in the hall."Holy Virgin! he has a child in his arms!  _Bambino bellissimo_!"  Suchwere the exclamations of wonder and surprise as they made a lane for mypassage, and I was in the presence of the Grand Duke, who appeared to bein a state of great excitement."It is the same person!" exclaimed the Duke.  "Confess! are you not theparty who put a packet into my hands about a quarter of an hour since?""I am the person, your Highness," replied I, as I patted and soothed thefrightened child."Who gave it you?""May it please your Highness, I do not know.""What child is that?""May it please your Highness, I do not know.""Where did you get it?""Out of that basket, your Highness.""Who gave you the basket?""May it please your Highness, I do not know.""You are trifling with me.  Let him be searched.""May it please your Highness, I will save them that trouble, if one ofthe ladies will take the infant.  I have received a great many presentsthis evening, all of which I will have the honour of displaying beforeyour Highness."One of the ladies held out her arms to the infant, who immediately bentfrom mine toward her, naturally clinging to the other sex as its friendin distress."In the first place, your Highness, I have this evening received thisring," taking off my finger the one given by the party in aviolet-coloured domino, and presenting it to him."And from whom?" said his Highness, instantly recognising the ring."May it please your Highness, I do not know.  I have also receivedanother ring, your Highness," continued I, taking off the ring given meby the black domino."And who gave you this?" interrogated the Duke, again evidentlyrecognising it."May it please your Highness, I do not know.  Also, this stiletto, butfrom whom, I must again repeat, I do not know.  Also, this packet, withdirections to put it into a dead man's bosom.""And you are, I presume, equally ignorant of the party who gave it toyou?""Equally so, your Highness; as ignorant as I am of the party who desiredme to present you with the other packet which I delivered.  Here is alsoa paper I was desired to pin upon a man's clothes after I hadassassinated him.""Indeed!--and to this, also, you plead total ignorance?""I have but one answer to give to all, your Highness, which is, I do notknow.""Perhaps, Sir, you do not know your own name or profession," observedhis Highness, with a sneer."Yes, your Highness," replied I, taking off my mask, "that I do know.  Iam an Englishman, and, I trust, a gentleman, and a man of honour.  Myname is Herbert; and I have more than once had the honour to be a guestat your Highness's entertainments.""Signor, I recognise you," replied the Grand Duke.  "Let the room becleared--I must speak with this gentleman alone."When the company had quitted the saloon, I entered into a minute detailof the events of the evening, to which his Highness paid the greatestattention; and when I had finished, the whole mystery was unravelled tome by him, and with which I will now satisfy the curiosity of myreaders.The Grand Duke had one daughter, by name Viola, whom he had wished tomarry to Rodolph, Count of Istria; but Viola had met with Albert,Marquis of Salerno, and a mutual attachment had ensued.  Although theGrand Duke would not force his daughter's wishes and oblige her to marryCount Rodolph, at the same time he would not consent to her espousalswith the Marquis Albert.  Count Rodolph had discovered the intimacybetween Viola and the Marquis of Salerno, and had made more than oneunsuccessful attempt to get rid of his rival by assassination.  Aftersome time, a private marriage with the marquis had been consented to byViola; and a year afterwards the Lady Viola retired to the country, andwithout the knowledge, or even suspicions, of her father, had givenbirth to a male child, which had been passed off as the offspring of oneof the ladies of the court who was married, and to whom the secret hadbeen confided.At this period the secret societies, especially the _Carbonari_, hadbecome formidable in Italy, and all the crowned heads and reigningprinces were using every exertion to suppress them.  Count Rodolph wasat the head of these societies, having joined them to increase hispower, and to have at his disposal the means of getting rid of hisrival.  Of this the Marquis of Salerno had received intimation, and forsome time had been trying to obtain proof against the count; for he knewthat if once it was proved, Count Rodolph would never be again permittedto appear in the state of Lucca.  On the other hand, Count Rodolph hadbeen making every arrangement to get rid of his rival, and haddetermined that it should be effected at this masquerade.The Marquis of Salerno had notice given him of this intention, and alsohad on that morning obtained the proof against Count Rodolph, which hewas now determined to forward to the Grand Duke; but, aware that hisassassination by the _Carbonari_ was to be attempted, and also that thewrath of the Grand Duke would be excessive when he was informed of theirprivate marriage, he resolved to fly with his wife to Pisa, trustingthat the proofs of Count Rodolph being connected with the _Carbonari_,and a little time, would soften down the Grand Duke's anger.  Themarquis had arranged that he should escape from the Duke's dominions onthe night of the masquerade, as it would be much easier for his wife toaccompany him from thence than from the Grand Duke's palace, which waswell guarded; but it was necessary that they should travel on horseback,and they could not take their child with them.  Viola would not consentthat it should be left behind; and on this emergency he had written tohis friend, the Count d'Ossore, to come to their assistance at themasquerade, and, that they might recognise him, to wear a sky-bluedomino, a colour but seldom put on.  The Count d'Ossore had that morningleft his town mansion on a hunting excursion, and did not receive theletter, of which the Marquis and Viola were ignorant.  Such was thestate of affairs at the time that I put on the sky-blue domino to go tothe masquerade.My first meeting with the marquis in his violet-coloured domino iseasily understood: being in a sky-blue domino I was mistaken for theCount d'Ossore.  I was myself led into the mistake by the Marquis Alberthaving the same Christian name as my English friend.  The second meetingwith the Count Rodolph, in the black domino, was accidental.  The nextwalk had been appointed as the place of meeting with the _Carbonari_Felippo and his companions; but Count Rodolph, perceiving me examiningmy stiletto by the light of the lamp, presumed that I was Felippo, andthat I had mistaken the one path for the other which had been agreedupon.  The papers given to me by Count Rodolph were _Carbonari_ papers,which were to be hid in the marquis's bosom after he had beenassassinated, to make it appear that he had belonged I to that society,and by the paper affixed to his clothes, that he had been murdered bythe agents of the society for having betrayed them.  The papers whichthe marquis had requested me to give to the Grand Duke were the proofsof Count Rodolph's belonging to the secret society; and with the paperswas enclosed a letter to the Grand Duke, in which they I acknowledgedtheir secret union.  And now, I believe, the reader will comprehend thewhole of this mysterious affair.After all had been explained, I ventured to ask his Highness if he wouldpermit me to fulfil my promise of taking the child to its mother, as Iconsidered it a point of honour that I should keep my engagement, themore so, as the delay would occasion the greatest distress to hisdaughter; and I ventured to add, that I trusted his Highness wouldpardon what could not now be remedied, and that I should have thesatisfaction of being the bearer of such pleasing intelligence to hisdaughter and the marquis.The Grand Duke paced the room for a minute, and then replied, "SignorHerbert, I feel so disgusted with the treachery and baseness of CountRodolph, that I hardly need observe, if my daughter were free he nevershould espouse her; indeed, he will have immediate orders to quit thestate.  You have been instrumental in preserving the life of the Marquisof Salerno, who is my son-in-law, and as matters now stand, I amindebted to you.  Your dismissal of the bravoes, by means of the count'sring, was a masterly stroke.  You shall have the pleasure of taking myforgiveness to my daughter and her husband; but as for the child, it mayas well remain here.  Tell Viola I retain it as a hostage for the quickreturn of its mother."I took my leave of his Highness, and hastened to Pisa, where I soonfound out the retreat of the marquis and his wife.  I sent up my name,requesting immediate admittance, as having a message from the GrandDuke.  I found them in great distress.  The Count d'Ossore had returnedlate on the night of the masquerade, found the letter, hastened to theMarquesa de Cesto's, and had arrived just after the elopement had beendiscovered.  He immediately followed them to Pisa, when an explanationtook place, and they discovered that they had been communicating withsome unknown person, by whom they had, in all probability, beenbetrayed.It would be difficult to portray their astonishment and joy when Ientered into a detail of what had occurred, and wound up with themessage from the Grand Duke; and I hardly need add, now that I wind upmy story, that the proofs of gratitude I received from the marquis andhis wife, during my subsequent residence in Italy, left me no occasionto repent that I had gone to the masquerade of the Marquesa de Cesto, ina SKY-BLUE DOMINO.THE END.CHAPTER FORTY FIVE.MODERN TOWN HOUSES.I have often thought, when you consider the difference of comfortbetween houses built from sixty to a hundred years back, in comparisonwith the modern edifices, that the cry of the magician in "Aladdin," hadhe called out "new houses," instead of "new lamps," for old ones, wouldnot have appeared so very absurd.  It was my good fortune, for the majorpart of my life, to occupy an ancient house, built, I believe, in thereign of Queen Elizabeth.  My father lived in it before I was inexistence: I was born in it, and it was bequeathed to me.  It has sincebeen my misfortune to have lived three years in one of the modern-builthouses; and although I have had my share of the ills to which we all areheir, I must date my real unhappiness from the first month after I tookpossession.  With your permission, I will enter into my history, as itmay prove a warning to others, who will not remember the old proverb of"_Let well alone_."I am a married man, with six children; my three eldest are daughters,and have now quitted a school, near Portman-Square, to which my wifeinsisted upon my sending them, as it was renowned for finishing youngladies.  Until their return to domiciliate themselves under my roof, Inever heard a complaint of my house, which was situated at Brompton.  Itwas large, airy, and comfortable, with excellent shrubberies, and a fewacres of land; and I possessed every comfort and even luxury which couldbe rationally required, my wife and daughters having their carriage, andin every respect my establishment being that of a gentleman.I had not, however, taken my daughters from school more than two months,before I was told that we were "living out of the world," although not amile and a half from Hyde Park Corner; and, to my surprise, my wifejoined in the cry; it was always from morn to night, "We might do thisbut, we cannot do this because, we are quite out of the world."  It wastoo far to dine out in town; too far for people to come and dine withus; too far to go to the play, or the opera; too far to drive in thepark; too far even to walk in Kensington Gardens.  I remonstrated, thatwe had managed to dine out, to receive visitors, and to enjoy all otheramusements very well for a considerable number of years, and that it didnot appear to me that Brompton had walked away from London, on thecontrary, that London was making rapid advances towards Brompton; but itwould not do,--all day the phrase rang in my ears, "out of the world,"until I almost began to wish that I was out too.  But it is no usehaving the best of an argument when opposed to women.  I had my choice,either to give up my house, and take another in London, or to give up mypeace.  With an unwilling sigh, I at last consented to leave a placedear to me, from long association and many reminiscences; and it wasarranged that Brompton Hall was to be let, or sold, and that we were tolook out immediately for a house in some of the squares in themetropolis.  If my wife and daughters found that the distance fromLondon was too far for other purposes, at all events it was not too farfor house-hunting.  They were at it incessantly week after week; and, atlast, they fixed upon one in the neighbourhood of Belgrave-Square,which, as they repeated, possessed all the cheerfulness and fresh air ofthe country, all the advantages of a town residence.  The next day I wasto be dragged to see it, and give my opinion; at the same time, from thecommendations bestowed upon it previous to my going, I felt assured thatI was expected to give their opinion, and not my own.The next day, accordingly, we repaired thither, setting off immediatelyafter breakfast, to meet the surveyor and builder, who was to be on thespot.  The house in question was one of a row just building, or built,whitened outside, in imitation of stone.  It was Number 2.  Number 1 wasfinished; but the windows still stained with the drippings of thewhitewash and colouring.  Number 2, the one in question, was complete;and, as the builder asserted, ready for immediate occupation.  Number 3was not so far advanced.  As for the others, they were at presentnothing but carcasses, without even the front steps built to them; andyou entered them by a drawbridge of planks.The builder stood at the front door, and bowed most respectfully."Why," observed I, looking at the piles of mortar, lime, and bricks,standing about in all directions, "we shall be smothered with dust andlime for the next two years.""Don't be alarmed, sir," replied the builder; "every house in the rowwill be finished before the winter.  We really cannot attend to theapplications for them."We entered the house."Is not the entrance handsome?" observed my wife; "so neat and clean."To this I had not a reply to make; it certainly did look neat and clean.We went into the dining-room.  "What a nice room," exclaimed my eldestdaughter.  "How many can we dine in this room?""Um!" replied I; "about twelve, I suppose, comfortably.""Dear me!" observed the builder; "you have no notion of the size of thehouse; rooms are so deceiving, unfurnished.  You may sit down twentywith ease; I'll appeal to the lady.  Don't you think so, ma'am?""Yes, I do," replied my wife.After that we went over the drawing-rooms, bed-rooms, and attics.Every bed-room was apportioned by my wife and daughters, and the otherswere allotted to the servants; and that in the presence of the builder,who took good note of all that passed.The kitchen was admired; so were the pantry, scullery, coal-hole,dust-hole, etcetera; all so nice and clean; so compact; and, as thebuilder observed, not a nail to drive anywhere."Well, my dear, what do you think now? isn't it a charming house?" saidmy wife, as we re-ascended into the dining-parlour."It's a very nice house, my dear; but still it requires a littleconsideration," replied I."Consideration, my dear?" replied my wife; "what! now that you have goneover it?""I am afraid that I cannot give you very long, sir," observed thebuilder; "there are two other parties after the house, and I am to givethem an answer by two o'clock.""Mr Smithers told me the same yesterday," whispered my wife."What did you say the rent was, Mr Smithers?""Only 200 pounds per annum.""Any ground-rent?""Only 27 pounds 10 shillings.""And the taxes?""Oh, they will be a mere trifle.""The rent appears to me to be very high.""High, my dear sir! consider the situation, the advantages.  We can'tbuild them fast enough at that price.  But of course, sir, you bestknow," replied he, carelessly walking towards the window."Take it; my dear," said my wife."You must take it, papa.""Pray take it, papa.""Mr Whats-your-name, I beg your pardon--""Smithers, sir," said the builder, turning round."Pray, Mr Smithers, what term of lease do you let at?""Seven, fourteen, or twenty-one, at the option of either party, sir.""I should have no objection to take it for three years.""Three years, my dear sir!--that would be doing yourself an injustice.You would lose half the value of your fixtures provided you left--andthen the furniture.  Depend upon it, sir, if you once get into it, youwill never wish to leave it.""That may or not be," replied I; "but I will not take it for more thanthree years.  The town-air may not agree with me; and if, as you say,people are so anxious to take the houses, of course it can make nodifference to you.""I'm afraid, sir, that for so short a time--""I will not take it for longer," replied I, rising up, glad of an excuseto be off."Oh, papa!""My dear Mr B--.""On that point," replied I, "I will not be overruled.  I will not take alease for more than three years, with the right of continuing, if Iplease."The builder perceived that I was in earnest."Well, sir," replied he, "I hardly know what to say; but rather thandisappoint the ladies, I will accept you as a tenant for three yearscertain.""Confound the fellow!" thought I; but I was pinned, and there was an endof the matter.  Mr Smithers pulled out paper and ink; two letters ofagreement were written upon a small deal table, covered with blotches ofvarious coloured paints; and the affair was thus concluded.We got into the carriage and drove home, my wife and daughters inecstasies, and I obliged to appear very well satisfied, that I might notdamp their spirits; yet I must say that although the house appeared avery nice house, I had my forebodings."At all events," thought I, "the lease is only for three years;" andthus I consoled myself.The next day the whole house was in commotion.  I believe my wife anddaughters were up at daybreak.  When I went into the breakfast room, Idiscovered that the pictures had been taken down, although there was nochance of their being hung up for many weeks at least, and every thingwas in preparation for packing up.  After breakfast my wife set off fortown to order carpets and curtains, and did not come home till sixo'clock, very tired with the fatigues of the day.  She had also broughtthe measure of every grate, to ascertain what fenders would suit; themeasure of the bed-rooms and attics, to remodel the carpets; for it wasproposed that Brompton Hall should be disposed of, the new occupiertaking at a valuation what furniture might be left.  To this I appearedto consent; but was resolved in my own mind that, if taken, it shouldonly be for the same term of years as my new lease.  I will pass over amonth of hurry, bustle, and confusion; at the end of which I foundmyself in our new habitation.  It was completely furnished, with theexception of the drawing-room carpet, which had not been laid down, butwas still in a roll tied up with packthread in the middle of the room.The cause of this I soon understood from my wife.  It was always thecustom, she said, to give a house-warming upon entering a new house, andshe therefore proposed giving a little dance.  To this, as it wouldplease her and my daughters, I raised no objection.I have always observed, that what is proposed as a little danceinvariably ends in a great one; for from the time of proposing till thecards are about, it increases like a snowball; but that arises, perhaps,from the extreme difficulty of knowing when to draw the line betweenfriends and acquaintances.  I have also observed that when your wife anddaughters intend such a thing, they always obtain permission for theball first, and then tack on the supper afterwards; commencing with amere stand-up affair,--sandwiches, cakes, and refreshments,--and endingwith a regular sit-down affair, with Gunter presiding over all.  Themusic from two fiddles and a piano also swells into Collinet's band,verifying the old adage, "In for a penny, in for a pound."  But to allthis I gave my consent; I could afford it well, and I liked to please mywife and daughters.  The ball was given, and this house-warming ended inhouse-breaking; for just before the supper-quadrille, as it was termed,when about twenty-four young ladies and gentlemen were going the grandronde, a loud noise below, with exclamations and shrieks, was heard, andsoon afterwards the whole staircase was smothered with dust."What _is_ the matter?" cried my wife, who had passed to thelanding-place on the stairs before me."Ma'am," said one of Mr Gunter's men, shaking the lappets of his bluecoat, which were covered with white dust, "the whole ceiling of thedining-room has come down!""Ceiling come down!" screamed my wife."Yes, ma'am," replied our own servant; "and the supper and supper-tablesare all smashed flat with the weight on it."Here was a catastrophe.  My wife hastened down, and I followed.  Sureenough the weight of mortar had crushed all beneath it--all was chaosand confusion.  Jellies, blancmanges, pates, cold roasts, creams,trifles,--all in one mass of ruin, mixed up with lime, horse-hair,plaster of Paris, and stucco.  It wore all the appearance of a Swissavalanche in miniature."Good heavens, how dreadful!" exclaimed my wife."How much more so if there had been people in the room," replied I."What could be the cause of it!" exclaimed my wife."These new houses, sir, won't bear dancing in," observed Mr Gunter'shead man."So it appears," replied I.This unfortunate accident was the occasion of the party breaking up:they knew that there was no chance of supper, which they had lookedforward to; so they put on their shawls and departed, leaving us toclear up the wreck at our leisure.  In fact, as my daughters declared,it quite spoiled the ball as well as the supper.The next morning I sent for Mr Smithers, who made his appearance, andshowed him what had taken place."Dear me, I'm very sorry; but you had too many people above stairs--thatis very clear.""Very clear, indeed, Mr Smithers.  We had a ball last night.""A ball, sir!  Oh, then no wonder.""No wonder!  What! do you mean to say that balls are not to be given?""Why, really, sir, we do not build private houses for ball-rooms--wecould not, sir; the price of timber just now is enormous, and theadditional strength required would never pay us.""What then! do you mean to say that there are no balls to be given inLondon?""Oh no, sir!--certainly not; but you must be aware that few people do.Even our aristocracy hire Willis's rooms for their balls.  Some of theold houses, indeed, such as Devonshire House, may do for such a thing.""But, Mr Smithers, I expect you will make this ceiling good.""Much obliged to you, sir, for giving me the preference--I will do it asreasonable as anybody," replied Mr Smithers, bowing.  "I will order myworkmen directly--they are only next door."For a fortnight we were condemned to dine in the back dining-room; andafter that Mr Smithers sent in a bill which cost me more than the balland supper.So soon as all was right again, I determined that I would hang up mypictures; for I had been accustomed to look at them for years, and Imissed them.  I sent for a carpenter, and gave him directions."I have the middle now, sir, exactly," said the man, standing on thehigh steps; "but," continued he, tapping with his hammer, "I can't findwood.""Can't find wood!""No, sir," replied the man, tapping as far as he could reach from rightto left; "nothing to nail to, sir.  But there never is no wood in thesenew-built houses.""Confound your new houses!" exclaimed I."Well, it is very provoking, my dear!" exclaimed my wife."I suppose that their new houses are not built for pictures any morethan for balls," replied I; and I sighed.  "What must be done?""I think, sir, if you were to order brass rods to be fixed from onecorner to the other, we might find means to fasten them," observed thecarpenter; "but there's no wood, that's certain.""What the devil is the house built of then?" exclaimed I."All lath and plaster, sir," replied the man, tapping right and left.At a heavy expense I procured the rods, and at last the pictures werehung up.The next annoyance that we had was a very bad smell, which we found toproceed from the drains; and the bricklayers were sent for.  All thedrains were choked, it appeared, from their being so very narrow; andafter having up the whole basement, at the expense of 40 pounds, thatnuisance was abated.We now had two months' repose, and I was in hopes that things would goon more comfortably; but one day I overheard a conversation between mywife and daughters, as I passed by the door of the room, which I mustcandidly acknowledge gave me satisfaction."It's really very awkward, mamma--one don't know where to put anything:there's not a cupboard or stow-hole in the whole house--not even astore-room.""Well, it is so, my dear; I wonder we did not observe it when we lookedover it.  What a nice set of cupboards we had at Brompton Hall.""Oh! yes--I wish we had them here, mamma.  Couldn't we have some built?""I don't like to speak to your papa about it, my dear; he has alreadybeen put to such expense, what with the ceiling and the drains.""Then don't, mamma; papa is really very good-natured."The equinoxes now came on, and we had several gales of wind, with heavyrain--the slates blew off and rattled up and down all night, while thewind howled round the corner of the square.  The next morning complaintsfrom all the attic residents; one's bed was wetted quite through withthe water dropping through the ceiling--another had been obliged to puta basin on the floor to catch the leak--all declared that the roof waslike a sieve.  Sent again for Mr Smithers, and made a complaint."This time, Mr Smithers," said I, with the lease in my hand, "I believeyou will acknowledge these are landlord's repairs.""Certainly, sir, certainly," exclaimed Mr Smithers; "I shall desire oneof my men to look to it immediately; but the fact is, with such heavygales, the slates must be expected to move a little.  Duchesses andcountesses are very light, and the wind gets underneath them.""Duchesses and countesses very light!" exclaimed my wife; "what do youmean?""It's the term we give to slates, madam," replied he; "we cannot put ona heavy roof with a brick-and-a-half wall.  It would not support one.""_Brick-and-a-half_ wall!" exclaimed I;--"surely, Mr Smithers, that'snot quite safe with a house so high.""Not quite safe, my dear sir, if it were a single house; but," added he,"in a row, one house supports another.""Thank Heaven," thought I, "I have but a three-years' lease, and sixmonths are gone already."But the annoyances up to this period were internal; we now had toexperience the external nuisances attending a modern-built house."Number 1 is taken, papa, and they are getting the furniture in," saidmy eldest daughter one day; "I hope we shall have nice neighbours.  AndWilliam told Mary that Mr Smithers told him, when he met him in thestreet, that he was now going to fit up Number 3 as fast as he could."The report was true, as we found from the report of the carpenters'hammers for the next three or four weeks.  We could not obtain amoment's sleep except in the early part of the night, or a minute'srepose to our ears during the day.  The sound appeared as if it was _in_our house instead of next door; and it commenced at six o'clock in themorning, and lasted till seven in the evening.  I was hammered to death;and, unfortunately, there was a constant succession of rain, whichprevented me going out to avoid it.  I had nothing to do but to watch mypictures, as they jumped from the wall with the thumps of the hammers.At last Number 3 was floored, wainscotted, and glazed, and we had aweek's repose.By this time Number 1 was furnished, and the parties who had taken itcame in.  They were a gouty old gentleman, and his wife, who, reportsaid, had once been his cook.  My daughters' hopes of pleasantneighbours were disappointed.  Before they had been in a week, we foundourselves at issue: the old gentleman's bed was close to thepartition-wall, and in the dead of the night we could distinctly hearhis groans and also his execrations and exclamations, when the fit cameon him.  My wife and daughters declared that it was quite horrible, andthat they could not sleep for them.Upon the eighth day there came a note:--"Mrs Whortleback's complimentsto Mr and Mrs --, and begs that the young people will not play on thepiany, as Mr Whortleback is very ill with the gout."Now, my daughters were proficients on the piano, and practised a greatdeal.  This note was anything but satisfactory: to play when the oldgentleman was ill would be barbarous,--not to play was to depriveourselves of our greatest pleasure."Oh dear! how very disagreeable," cried my daughters."Yes, my dear; but if we can hear his groans, it's no wonder that he canhear the piano and harp: recollect the wall is only a brick and a halfthick.""I wonder music don't soothe him," observed the eldest.Music is a mockery to a man in agony.  A man who has been broken on thewheel would not have his last hours soothed by the finest orchestra.After a week, during which we sent every day to inquire after MrWhortleback's health, we ventured to resume the piano and harp; uponwhich the old gentleman became testy, and sent for a man with a trumpet,placing him in the balcony, and desiring him to play as much out of tuneas possible whenever the harp and piano sounded a note.  Thus were we atopen hostility with our only neighbour; and, as we were certain if mydaughters touched their instruments, to have the trumpet blowing discordfor an hour or two either that day or the next, at last the piano wasunopened, and the harp remained in its case.  Before the year closed,Number 3 became tenanted; and here we had a new annoyance.  It wasoccupied by a large family; and there were four young ladies who werelearning music.  We now had our annoyance: it was strum, strum, all daylong; one sister up, another down; and every one knows what a bore thefirst lessons in music are to those who are compelled to hear them.They could just manage to play a tune, and that eternal tune was ringingin our ears from morning to night.  We could not send our compliments,or blow a trumpet.  We were forced to submit to it.  The nursery alsobeing against the partition wall, we had the squalls and noise of thechildren on the one side, added to groans and execrations of the oldgentleman on the other.However, custom reconciled us to everything, and the first vexationgradually wore off.  Yet I could not help observing that when I wassupposed not to be in hearing, the chief conversation of my wife, whenher friends called upon her, consisted of a description of all thenuisances and annoyances that we suffered; and I felt assured that sheand my daughters were as anxious to return to Brompton Hall as I was.In fact, the advantages which they had anticipated by their townresidence were not realised.  In our situation, we were as far off frommost of our friends, and still farther from some than we were before,and we had no longer the same amusements to offer them.  At our formershort distance from town, access was more easy to those who did not keepa carriage, that is, the young men; and those were the parties who, ofcourse, my wife and daughters cared for most.  It was very agreeable tocome down with their portmanteaus,--enjoy the fresh air and green lanesof the country for an afternoon,--dine, sleep, and breakfast, and returnthe next morning by conveyances which passed us every quarter of anhour; but to dine with us in -- Square, when the expense of ahackney-coach there and back was no trifle, and to return at eleveno'clock at night, was not at all agreeable.  We found that we had not somuch society, nor were we half so much courted, as at Brompton Hall.This was the bitterest blow of all, and my wife and daughters would lookout of the windows and sigh; often a whole day passed without one friendor acquaintance dropping in to relieve its monotony.We continued to reside there, nevertheless, for I had made up my mindthat the three years would be well spent if they cured my wife anddaughters of their town mania; and although anxious, as I am sure theywere, to return, I never broached the matter, for I was determined thatthe cure should be radical.  Numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, were finishedthe next year, and, by the persuasions of Mr Smithers, were taken bydifferent parties in the spring.  And now we had another nuisance.Nothing but eternal rings at the bell.  The man-servant grumbled, andwas behind with his work; and when scolded, replied that there was notime for any thing, that when cleaning his knives and plate the bell wasrung, and he was obliged to wash himself, throw on his jacket, and go upto answer the front door; that the bell was not rung for us, but to findout where some new-comer lived, and to ascertain this they always rangat the house which appeared the longest inhabited.  There was no end tothe ringing for some months, and we had three servants who absolutelyrefused to stay in so bad a place.  We had also to contend with lettersand notes in the same way, brought to us at haphazard: "Does MrSo-and-so live here?"--"No, he does not."--"Then pray where does he?"This was interminable, and not five minutes in the day passed withoutthe door-bell being rung.  For the sake of not changing my servants Iwas at last put to the expense of an extra boy for no other purpose butto answer the constant applications at the door.  At last we hadremained there for two years and nine months, and then my wife wouldoccasionally put the question whether I intended to renew the lease; andI naturally replied that I did not like change.Then she went upon another tack; observed that Clara did not appear wellfor some time, and that she thought that she required country air; but,in this, I did not choose to agree with her.One day I came home, and, rubbing my hands as if pleased, said, "Well,at last I've an offer for Brompton Villa for a term of seven years,--avery fair offer and good tenants,--so that will now be off my hands."My wife looked mortified, and my daughters held down their heads."Have you let it, papa?" said one of my daughters, timidly."No, not yet; but I am to give an answer to-morrow morning.""It requires consideration, my dear," replied my wife."Requires consideration!" said I.  "Why, my dear, the parties have seenthe house, and I have been trying to let it these three years.  Irecollect when I took this house I said it required consideration, butyou would not allow any such thing.""I'm sure I wish we had," said Clara."And so do I.""The fact is, my dear," said my wife, coming round to the back of mychair, and putting her arms round my neck, "we all wish to go back toBrompton.""Yes, yes, papa," added my daughters, embracing me on each side."You will allow, then, that I was right in not taking a lease for morethan three years.""Yes: how lucky you were so positive!""Well, then, if that is the case, we will unfurnish this house, and, assoon as you please, go back to Brompton Hall."I hardly need observe that we took possession of our old abode withdelight, and that I have had no more applications for a change ofresidence, or have again heard the phrase that we were living "out ofthe world."CHAPTER FORTY SIX.THE WAY TO BE HAPPY.Cut your coat according to your cloth, is an old maxim and a wise one;and if people will only square their ideas according to theircircumstances, how much happier might we all be!  If we only would comedown a peg or two in our notions, in accordance with our waningfortunes, happiness would be always within our reach.  It is not what wehave, or what we have not, which adds or subtracts from our felicity.It is the longing for more than we have, the envying of those whopossess that more, and the wish to appear in the world of moreconsequence than we really are, which destroy our peace of mind, andeventually lead to ruin.I never witnessed a man submitting to circumstances with good humour andgood sense, so remarkably as in my friend Alexander Willemott.  When Ifirst met him, since our school days, it was at the close of the war: hehad been a large contractor with Government for army clothing andaccoutrements, and was said to have realised an immense fortune,although his accounts were not yet settled.  Indeed it was said thatthey were so vast, that it would employ the time of six clerks, for twoyears, to examine them, previous to the balance sheet being struck.  AsI observed, he had been at school with me, and, on my return from theEast Indies, I called upon him to renew our old acquaintance, andcongratulate him upon his success."My dear Reynolds, I am delighted to see you.  You must come down toBelem Castle; Mrs Willemott will receive you with pleasure, I'm sure.You shall see my two girls."I consented.  The chaise stopped at a splendid mansion, and I wasushered in by a crowd of liveried servants.  Every thing was on the mostsumptuous and magnificent scale.  Having paid my respects to the lady ofthe house, I retired to dress, as dinner was nearly ready, it being thenhalf-past seven o'clock.  It was eight before we sat down.  To anobservation that I made, expressing a hope that I had not occasioned thedinner being put off, Willemott replied, "On the contrary, my dearReynolds, we never sit down until about this hour.  How people can dineat four or five o'clock, I cannot conceive.  I could not touch amouthful."The dinner was excellent, and I paid the encomiums which were its due."Do not be afraid, my dear fellow--my cook is an _artisteextraordinaire_--a regular _Cordon Bleu_.  You may eat any thing withoutfear of indigestion.  How people can live upon the English cookery ofthe present day, I cannot conceive.  I seldom dine out, for fear ofbeing poisoned.  Depend upon it, a good cook lengthens your days, and noprice is too great to insure one."When the ladies retired, being alone, we entered into friendlyconversation.  I expressed my admiration of his daughters, who certainlywere very handsome and elegant girls."Very true; they are more than passable," replied he.  "We have had manyoffers, but not such as come up to my expectations.  Baronets are cheapnow-a-days, and Irish lords are nothings; I hope to settle themcomfortably.  We shall see.  Try this claret; you will find itexcellent, not a headache in a hogshead of it.  How people can drinkport, I cannot imagine."The next morning he proposed that I should rattle round the park withhim.  I acceded, and we set off in a handsome open carriage, with fourgreys, ridden by postilions at a rapid pace.  As we were whirling along,he observed, "In town we must of course drive but a pair, but in thecountry I never go out without four horses.  There is a spring in fourhorses which is delightful; it makes your spirits elastic, and you feelthat the poor animals are not at hard labour.  Rather than not drivefour, I would prefer to stay at home."Our ride was very pleasant, and in such amusements passed away one ofthe most pleasant weeks that I ever remembered.  Willemott was not theleast altered--he was as friendly, as sincere, as open-hearted, as whena boy at school.  I left him, pleased with his prosperity, andacknowledging that he was well deserving of it, although his ideas hadassumed such a scale of magnificence.I went to India when my leave expired, and was absent about four years.On my return, I inquired after my friend Willemott, and was told thathis circumstances and expectations had been greatly altered.  From manycauses, such as a change in the Government, a demand for economy, andthe wording of his contracts having been differently rendered from whatWillemott had supposed their meaning to be, large items had been struckout of his balance sheet, and, instead of being a millionaire, he wasnow a gentleman with a handsome property.  Belem Castle had been sold,and he now lived at Richmond, as hospitable as ever, and was considereda great addition to the neighbourhood.  I took the earliest opportunityof going down to see him."Oh, my dear Reynolds, this is really kind of you to come withoutinvitation.  Your room is ready, and bed well aired, for it was slept inthree nights ago.  Come--Mrs Willemott will be delighted to see you."I found the girls still unmarried, but they were yet young.  The wholefamily appeared as contented and happy, and as friendly, as before.  Wesat down to dinner at six o'clock; the footman and coachman attended.The dinner was good, but not by the _artiste extraordinaire_.  I praisedeverything."Yes," replied he, "she is a very good cook; she unites the solidity ofthe English with the delicacy of the French fare; and, altogether, Ithink it a _decided improvement_.  Jane is quite a treasure."  Afterdinner, he observed, "Of course you know I have sold Belem Castle, andreduced my establishment.  Government have not treated me fairly, but Iam at the mercy of Commissioners, and a body of men will do that which,as individuals, they would be ashamed of.  The fact is, the odium isborne by no one in particular, and it is only the sense of shame whichkeeps us honest, I am afraid.  However, here you see me, with acomfortable fortune, and always happy to see my friends, especially myold schoolfellow.  Will you take _port_ or claret; the port is veryfine, and so is the claret.  By the by, do you know--I'll let you into afamily secret; Louisa is to be married to a Colonel Willer--an_excellent_ match!  It has made us all happy."The next day we drove out, not in an open carriage as before, but in achariot and with a _pair of horses_."These are handsome horses," observed I."Yes," replied he, "I am fond of good horses; and, as I only keep apair, I have the best.  There is a certain degree of pretension in _fourhorses_, I do not much like--it appears as if you wished to overtop yourneighbours."I spent a few very pleasant days, and then quitted his hospitable roof.A severe cold, caught that winter, induced me to take the advice of thephysicians, and proceed to the South of France, where I remained twoyears.  On my return, I was informed that Willemott had speculated, andhad been unlucky on the Stock Exchange; that he had left Richmond, andwas now living at Clapham.  The next day I met him near the Exchange."Reynolds, I am happy to see you.  Thompson told me that you had comeback.  If not better engaged, come down to see me; I will drive you downat four o'clock, if that will suit."It suited me very well, and, at four o'clock, I met him according toappointment at a livery stables over the Iron Bridge.  His vehicle wasordered out, it was a phaeton drawn by two long-tailed ponies--altogether a very neat concern.  We set off at a rapid pace."They step out well, don't they?  We shall be down in plenty of time toput on a pair of shoes by five o'clock, which is _our dinner-time_.Late dinners don't agree with me--they produce indigestion.  Of course,you know that Louisa has a little boy."I did not; but congratulated him."Yes, and has now gone out to India with her husband.  Mary is alsoengaged to be married--a very _good_ match--a Mr Rivers, in the law.He has been called to the bar this year, and promises well.  They willbe a little pinched at first, but we must see what we can do for them."We stopped at a neat row of houses, I forget the name, and, as we droveup, the servant, the only man-servant, came out, and took the poniesround to the stable, while the maid received my luggage, and one or twopaper-bags, containing a few extras for the occasion.  I was met withthe same warmth as usual by Mrs Willemott.  The house was small, butvery neat; the remnants of former grandeur appeared here and there, inone or two little articles, favourites of the lady.  We sat down at fiveo'clock to a _plain_ dinner, and were attended by the footman, who hadrubbed down the ponies and pulled on his livery."A good plain cook is the best thing, after all," observed Willemott."Your fine cooks won't condescend to roast and boil.  Will you take someof this sirloin, the under-cut is excellent.  My dear, give Mr Reynoldssome Yorkshire pudding."When we were left alone after dinner, Willemott told me, veryunconcernedly, of his losses."It was my own fault," said he; "I wished to make up a little sum forthe girls, and risking what they would have had, I left them almostpennyless.  However, we can always command a bottle of port and abeef-steak, and _what more_ in this world can you have?  Will you takeport or white?--I have no claret to offer you."We finished our port, but I could perceive no difference in Willemott.He was just as happy and as cheerful as ever.  He drove me to town thenext day.  During our drive, he observed, "I like ponies, they are solittle trouble; and I prefer them to driving one horse in this vehicle,as I can put my wife and daughters into it.  It's selfish to keep acarriage for yourself alone, and one horse in a four-wheeled doublechaise appears like an imposition upon the poor animal."I went to Scotland, and remained about a year.  On my return, I foundthat my friend Willemott had again shifted his quarters.  He was atBrighton; and having nothing better to do, I put myself in the "Times,"and arrived at the Bedford Hotel.  It was not until after some inquiry,that I could find out his address.  At last I obtained it, in arespectable but not fashionable part of this overgrown town.  Willemottreceived me just as before."I have no spare bed to offer you, but you must breakfast and dine withus every day.  Our house is small, but it's very comfortable, andBrighton is a very convenient place.  You know Mary is married.  A goodplace in the courts was for sale, and my wife and I agreed to purchaseit for Rivers.  It has reduced us a little, but they are verycomfortable.  I have retired from business altogether; in fact, as mydaughters are both married, and we have enough to live upon, what can wewish for more?  Brighton is very gay, and always healthy; and, as forcarriage and horses, they are no use here--there are _flies_ at everycorner of the streets."I accepted his invitation to dinner.  A parlour-maid waited, buteverything, although very plain, was clean and comfortable."I have still a bottle of wine for a friend, Reynolds," said Willemott,after dinner; "but, for my part, I prefer _whisky-toddy_--it agrees withme better.  Here's to the health of my two girls, God bless them, andsuccess to them in life!""My dear Willemott," said I, "I take the liberty of an old friend, but Iam so astonished at your philosophy, that I cannot help it.  When I callto mind Belem Castle, your large establishment, your luxuries, yourFrench cook, and your stud of cattle, I wonder at your contented stateof mind under such a change of circumstances.""I almost wonder myself, my dear fellow," replied he.  "I never couldhave believed, at that time, that I could live happily under such achange of circumstances; but the fact is, that, although I have been acontractor, I have a good conscience; then, my wife is an excellentwoman, and provided she sees me and her daughters happy, thinks nothingabout herself; and, further, I have made it a rule, as I have been goingdown hill, to find reasons why I should be thankful, and notdiscontented.  Depend upon it, Reynolds, it is not a loss of fortunewhich will affect your happiness, as long as you have peace and love athome."I took my leave of Willemott and his wife, with respect as well asregard; convinced that there was no pretended indifference to worldlyadvantages; that it was not, that the grapes were sour, but that he hadlearned the whole art of happiness, by being contented with what he had,and by "cutting his coat according to his cloth."CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.HOW TO WRITE A FASHIONABLE NOVEL.[_Scene--Chamber in Lincoln's Inn_.  ARTHUR ANSARD _at a brieflesstable, tete-a-tete with his wig on a block_.  A _casts a disconsolatelook upon his companion, and soliloquises_.]Yes, there you stand, "partner of my toils, my feelings, and my fame."We do not _suit_, for we never gained a _suit_ together.  Well, whatwith reporting for the bar, writing for the Annuals and thePocket-books, I shall be able to meet all demands, except those of mytailor; and, as his bill is most characteristically long, I think Ishall be able to make it stretch over till next term, by which time Ihope to fulfil my engagements with Mr C, who has given me an order fora fashionable novel, written by a "nobleman."  But how I, who was neverinside of an aristocratical mansion in my life, whose whole idea ofCourt is comprised in the Court of King's Bench, am to complete myengagement, I know no more than my companion opposite, who looks soplacidly stupid under my venerable wig.  As far as the street door, thefootman and carriage, and the porter, are concerned, I can manage wellenough; but as to what occurs within doors I am quite abroad.  I shallnever get through the first chapter; yet that tailor's bill must bepaid.  (_Knocking outside_.)  Come in, I pray._Enter_ BARNSTAPLE._B_.  Merry Christmas to you, Arthur._A_.  Sit down, my dear fellow; but don't mock me with merry Christmas.He emigrated long ago.  Answer me seriously: do you think it possiblefor a man to describe what he never saw?_B (putting his stick up to his chin_.)  Why, 'tis possible; but I wouldnot answer for the description being quite correct._A_.  But suppose the parties who read it have never seen the thingdescribed?_B_.  Why then it won't signify whether the description be correct ornot._A_.  You have taken a load off my mind; but still I am not quite atease.  I have engaged to furnish C with a fashionable novel._B_.  What do you mean to imply by a fashionable novel?_A_.  I really can hardly tell.  His stipulations were, that it was tobe a "fashionable novel in three volumes, each volume not less thanthree hundred pages."_B_.  That is to say, that you are to assist him in imposing on thepublic._A_.  Something very like it, I'm afraid; as it is further agreed thatit is to be puffed as coming from a highly talented nobleman._B_.  You should not do it, Ansard._A_.  So conscience tells me, but my tailor's bill says Yes; and that isa thing out of all conscience.  Only look here.                                                 _Displays a long bill_._B_.  Why, I must acknowledge, Ansard, that there is some excuse.  Oneneeds must, when the devil drives; but you are capable of better things._A_.  I certainly don't feel great capability in this instance.  Butwhat can I do?  The man will have nothing else--he says the public willread nothing else._B_.  That is to say, that because one talented author astonished thepublic by style and merits peculiarly his own, and established, as itwere, a school for neophites, his popularity is to be injured bycontemptible imitators.  It is sufficient to drive a man mad, to findthat the tinsel of others, if to be purchased more cheaply, is to bepawned upon the public instead of his gold; and more annoying still,that the majority of the public cannot appreciate the difference betweenthe metal and the alloy.  Do you know, Ansard, that by getting up thiswork, you really injure the popularity of a man of great talent?_A_.  Will he pay my tailor's bill!_B_.  No; I dare say he has enough to do to pay his own.  What does yourtailor say?_A_.  He is a staunch reformer, and on March the 1st he declares that hewill have the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill--carried tomy credit.  Mr C, on the 10th of February, also expects the novel, thewhole novel, and nothing but the novel, and that must be a fashionablenovel.  Look here, Barnstaple.  (_Shows his tailor's bill_)._B_.  I see how it is.  He "pays your poverty, and not your will."_A_.  And, by your leave, I thus must pay my bill (_bowing_)._B_.  Well, well, I can help you: nothing more difficult than to write agood novel, and nothing more easy than to write a bad one.  If I werenot above the temptation, I could pen you a dozen of the latter everyordinary year, and thirteen, perhaps, in the bissextile.  So banish thatChristmas cloud from your brow; leave off nibbling your pen at the wrongend, and clap a fresh nib to the right one.  I have an hour to spare._A_.  I thank you: that spare hour of yours may save me many a spareday.  I'm all attention--proceed._B_.  The first point to be considered is the _tempus_, or time; thenext the _locus_, or place; and lastly the _dramatis personae_ and thus,chapter upon chapter, will you build a novel._A_.  Build!_B_.  Yes, build; you have had your dimensions given, the interior isleft to your own decoration.  First, as to the opening.  Suppose weintroduce the hero in his dressing-room.  We have something of the kindin Pelham; and if we can't copy his merits, we must his peculiarities.Besides, it always is effective: a dressing-room or boudoir of supposedgreat people, is admitting the vulgar into the arcana, which theydelight in._A_.  Nothing can be better._B_.  Then, as to time; as the hero is still in bed, suppose we say fouro'clock in the afternoon?_A_.  In the morning, you mean._B_.  No; the afternoon.  I grant you that fashionable young men in reallife get up much about the same time as other people; but in afashionable novel your real exclusive never rises early.  The very ideamakes the tradesman's wife lift up her eyes.  So begin.  "It was aboutthirty-three minutes after four, _post meridian_--."_A_.  Minute--to a minute!_B_.  "That the Honourable Augustus Bouverie's finely chiselled--"_A_.  Chiselled!_B_.  Yes; great people are always chiselled; common people are onlycast.--"Finely chiselled head was still recumbent upon his silk-encasedpillow.  His luxuriant and Antinous-like curls were now confined in_papillotes_ of the finest satin paper, and the _tout ensemble_ of hishead--"_A.  Tout ensemble_!_B_.  Yes; go on.--"Was gently compressed by a caul of the finestnet-work, composed of the threads spun from the beauteous production ofthe Italian worm."_A_.  Ah! now I perceive--a silk nightcap.  But why can't I say at oncea silk nightcap?_B_.  Because you are writing a fashionable novel.--"With the forefingerof his gloved left hand--"_A_.  But he's not coming in from a walk--he's not yet out of bed._B_.  You don't understand it.--"Gloved left hand he applied a gentlefriction to the portal of his right eye, which unclosing at the silentsummons, enabled him to perceive a repeater studded with brilliants, andascertain the exact minute of time, which we have already made known tothe reader, and at which our history opens."_A_.  A very grand opening indeed!_B_.  Not more than it ought to be for a fashionable novel.--"At thesound of a silver _clochette_, his faithful Swiss valet Coridon, who hadfor some time been unperceived at the door, waiting for some notice ofhis master, having thrown off the empire of Somnus, in his light pumps,covered with beaver, moved with noiseless step up to the bedside, likethe advance of eve stealing over the face of nature."_A_.  Rather an incongruous simile._B_.  Not for a fashionable novel.--"There he stood, like Taciturnitybowing at the feet of proud Authority."_A_.  Indeed, Barnstaple, that is too _outre_._B_.  Not a whit: I am in the true "Cambysis' vein."--"Coridon havingsoftly withdrawn the rose-coloured gros de Naples bed-curtains, which bysome might have been thought to have been rather too extravagantlyfringed with the finest Mechlin lace, exclaimed with a tone of tremulousdeference and affection, `_Monsieur a bien dormi_?'  `Coridon,' said theHonourable Augustus Bouverie, raising himself on his elbow in thateminently graceful attitude for which he was so remarkable whenreclining on the ottomans at Almacks--"_A_.  Are you sure they have ottomans there?_B_.  No; but your readers can't disprove it.--"`Coridon,' said he,surveying his attendant from head to foot, and ultimately assuming aseverity of countenance, `Coridon, you are becoming gross, if notpositively what the people call _fat_.'  The Swiss attendant fell backin graceful astonishment three steps, and arching his eyebrows,extending his inverted palms forward, and raising his shoulders abovethe apex of his head, exclaimed, `_Pardon, milor, j'en aurais un horreurparfait_.'  `I tell you,' replied our gracefully recumbent hero, `thatit is so, Coridon; and I ascribe it to your partiality for thatdetestable wine called Port.  Confine yourself to Hock and Moselle,sirrah: I fear me, you have a base hankering after mutton and beef.Restrict yourself to salads, and do not sin even with an omelette morethan once a week.  Coridon must be visionary and diaphanous, or he is noCoridon for me.  Remove my night-gloves, and assist me to rise: it ispast four o'clock, and the sun must have, by this time, sufficientlyaired this terrestrial globe.'"_A_.  I have it now; I feel I could go on for an hour._B_.  Longer than that, before you get him out of his dressing-room.You must make at least five chapters before he is apparelled, or how canyou write a fashionable novel, in which you cannot afford more than twoincidents in the three volumes?  Two are absolutely necessary for theeditor of the Gazette to extract as specimens, before he winds up aneulogy.  Do you think that you can proceed now for a week, without myassistance?_A_.  I think so, if you will first give me some general ideas.  In thefirst place, am I always to continue in this style?_B_.  No; I thought you knew better.  You must throw in patches ofphilosophy every now and then._A_.  Philosophy in a fashionable novel?_B_.  Most assuredly, or it would be complained of as trifling; but apiece, now and then, of philosophy, as unintelligible as possible,stamps it with deep thought.  In the dressing-room, or boudoir, it mustbe occasionally Epicurean; elsewhere, especially in the open air, moreStoical._A_.  I'm afraid that I shall not manage that without a specimen to copyfrom.  Now I think of it, Eugene Aram says something very beautiful on astarry night._B_.  He does: it is one of the most splendid pieces of writing in ourlanguage.  But I will have no profanation, Arthur;--to your pen again,and write.  We'll suppose our hero to have retired from the crowdedfestivities of a ball-room at some lordly mansion in the country, and tohave wandered into a churchyard, damp and dreary with a thick Londonfog.  In the light dress of fashion, he throws himself on a tombstone."Ye dead!" exclaims the hero, "where are ye?  Do your disembodiedspirits now float around me, and, shrouded in this horrible veil ofnature, glare unseen upon vitality?  Float ye upon this intolerablemist, in yourselves still more misty and intolerable?  Hold ye highjubilee to-night? or do ye crouch behind these monitorial stones,gibbering and chattering at one who dares thus to invade your precincts?Here may I hold communion with my soul, and, in the invisible presenceof those who could, but dare not to reveal.  Away! it must not be."_A_.  What mustn't be?_B_.  That is the mystery which gives the point to his soliloquy.  Leaveit to the reader's imagination._A_.  I understand.  But still the Honourable Augustus cannot lie in bedmuch longer, and I really shall not be able to get him out without yourassistance.  I do not comprehend how a man can get out of bed_gracefully_; he must show his bare legs, and the alteration of positionis in itself awkward._B_.  Not half so awkward as you are.  Do you not feel that he must notbe got out of bed at all--that is, by description._A_.  How then?_B_.  By saying nothing about it.  Recommence as follows:--"`I shouldlike the bath at seventy-six and a half, Coridon,' observed theHonourable Augustus Bouverie, as he wrapped his embroidered dressinggown round his elegant form, and sank into a _chaise longue_, wheeled byhis faithful attendant to the fire."  There, you observe, he is out ofbed, and nothing said about it._A_.  Go on, I pray thee._A_.  "`How is the bath perfumed?' `_Eau de mille fleurs_.' `_Eau demille fleurs_!  Did not I tell you last week that I was tired of thatvillainous compound?  It has been adulterated till nothing remains butits name.  Get me another bath immediately _a la violette_; and,Coridon, you may use that other scent, if there is any left, for thepoodle; but observe, only when _you_ take him an airing, not when hegoes with _me_.'"_A_.  Excellent!  I now feel the real merits of an exclusive; but yousaid something about dressing-room, or in-door philosophy._B_.  I did; and now is a good opportunity to introduce it.  Coridongoes into the ante-chamber to renew the bath, and of course your herohas met with a disappointment in not having the bath to his immediatepleasure.  He must press his hands to his forehead.  By-the-by,recollect that his forehead, when you describe it, must be high andwhite as snow: all aristocratical foreheads are--at least, are in afashionable novel._A_.  What! the women's and all?_B_.  The heroine's must be; the others you may lower as a contrast.But to resume with the philosophy.  He strikes his forehead, lifts hiseyes slowly up to the ceiling, and drops his right arm as slowly down bythe side of the _chaise longue_; and then in a voice so low that itmight have been considered a whisper, were it not for its clear andbrilliant intonation, he exclaims--_A_.  Exclaims in a whisper!_B_.  To be sure; you exclaim mentally, why should you not in a whisper?_A_.  I perceive--your argument is unanswerable._B_.  Stop a moment; it will run better thus:--"The Honourable AugustusBouverie no sooner perceived himself alone, than he felt the dark shadesof melancholy ascending and brooding over his mind, and enveloping histhrobbing heart in their--their _adamantine_ chains.  Yielding to theoverwhelming force, he thus exclaimed, `Such is life--we require but oneflower, and we are offered noisome thousands--refused that we wish, welive in loathing of that not worthy to be received--mourners from ourcradle to our grave, we utter the shrill cry at our birth, and we sinkin oblivion with the faint, wail of terror.  Why should we, then, evercommit the folly to be happy?'"_A_.  Hang me, but that's a poser!_B_.  Nonsense! hold your tongue; it is only preparatory to the end."Conviction astonishes and torments--destiny prescribes and falsifies--attraction drives us away--humiliation supports our energies.  Thus dowe recede into the present, and shudder at the Elysium of posterity."_A_.  I have written all that down, Barnstaple; but I cannot understandit, upon my soul!_B_.  If you had understood one particle, that particle I would haveerased.  This is your true philosophy of a fashionable novel, theextreme interest of which consists in its being unintelligible.  Peoplehave such an opinion of their own abilities, that if they understoodyou, they would despise you; but a dose like this strikes them withveneration for your talents._A_.  Your argument is unanswerable; but you said that I must describethe dressing-room._B_.  Nothing more easy; as a simile, compare it to the shrine of somefavoured saint in a richly-endowed Catholic church.  Three tables atleast, full of materials in methodised confusion--all tending to thebeautification of the human form divine.  Tinted perfumes in everyvariety of cut crystal receivers, gold and silver.  If at a loss, callat Bayley and Blew's, or Smith's in Bond Street.  Take an accuratesurvey of all you see, and introduce your whole catalogue.  You cannotbe too minute.  But, Arthur, you must not expect me to write the wholebook for you._A_.  Indeed I am not so exorbitant in my demands upon your good-nature;but observe, I may get up four or five chapters already with the hintsyou have given me, but I do not know how to move, such a creation of thebrain--so ethereal, that I fear he will melt away; and so fragile, thatI am in terror lest he fall to pieces.  Now only get him into thebreakfast-room for me, and then I ask no more for the present.  Onlydress him, and bring him _down stairs_._B_.  There again you prove your incapability.  Bring him down stairs!Your hero of a fashionable novel never ascends to the first floor.Bed-room, dressing-room, breakfast-room, library, and boudoir, all areupon a level.  As for his dressing, you must only describe it as perfectwhen finished; but not enter into a regular detail, except that, inconversation with his valet, he occasionally asks for somethingunheard-of, or fastidious to a degree.  You must not walk him from onechamber to another, but manage it as follows:--"It was not until thebeautiful airs of the French clock that decorated the mantel-piece hadbeen thrice played, with all their variations, that the HonourableAugustus Bouverie entered his library, where he found his assiduousCoridon burning an aromatic pastille to disperse the compound ofvillainous exhalations arising from the condensed metropolitanatmosphere.  Once more in a state of repose, to the repeated and almostaffecting solicitations of his faithful attendant, who alternatelypresented to him the hyson of Pekoe, the bohea of Twankay, the fragrantberry from the Asiatic shore, and the frothing and perfumed decoction ofthe Indian nut, our hero shook his head in denial, until he at last wasprevailed upon to sip a small liqueur glass of _eau sucre_."  The factis, Arthur, he is in love--don't you perceive?  Now introduce a friend,who rallies him--then a resolution to think no more of the heroine--abillet on a golden salver--a counter resolution--a debate which equipageto order--a decision at last--hat, gloves, and furred great coat--and bythat time you will have arrived to the middle of the first volume._A_.  I perceive; but I shall certainly stick there without yourassistance._B_.  You shall have it, my dear fellow.  In a week I will call again,and see how you get on.  Then we'll introduce the heroine; that, I cantell you, requires some tact--_au revoir_._A_.  Thanks, many thanks, my dear Barnstaple.  Fare you well.                                                      _Exit_ BARNSTAPLE._A (looking over his memoranda_.)--It will do!  (_Hopping and dancingabout the room_.)  Hurrah! my tailor's bill will be paid after all!------------------------------------------------------------------------PART II.MR ARTHUR ANSARD'S _Chambers as before_.  MR ANSARD. _with his eyesfixed upon the wig block, gnawing the feather end of his pen.  Thetable, covered with sundry sheets of foolscap, show strong symptoms ofthe Novel progressing_.ANSARD (_solus_).Where is Barnstaple?  If he do not come soon, I shall have finished mynovel without a heroine.  Well, I'm not the first person who has beenfoiled by a woman.  (_Continues to gnaw his pen in a brown study_.)BARNSTAPLE _enters unperceived, and slaps_ ANSARD _on the shoulder.  Thelatter starts up_._B_.  So, friend Ansard, making your dinner off your pen: it is notevery novel-writer who can contrive to do that even in anticipation.Have you profited by my instructions?_A_.  I wish I had.  I assure you that this light diet has notcontributed, as might be expected, to assist a heavy head, and onefeather is not sufficient to enable my genius to take wing.  If thepublic knew what dull work it is to write a novel, they would not besurprised at finding them dull reading.  _Ex nihilo nihil fit_.Barnstaple, I am at the very bathos of stupidity._B_.  You certainly were absorbed when I entered, for I introducedmyself._A_.  I wish you had introduced another personage with you--you wouldhave been doubly welcome._B_.  Who is that?_A_.  My heroine.  I have followed your instructions to the letter.  Myhero is as listless as I fear my readers will be, and he is not yet inlove.  In fact, he is only captivated with himself.  I have made himdismiss Coridon._B_.  Hah! how did you manage that?_A_.  He was sent to ascertain the arms on the panel of a carriage.  Inhis eagerness to execute his master's wishes, he came home with aconsiderable degree of perspiration on his brow, for which offence hewas immediately put out of doors._B_.  Bravo--it was unpardonable--but still--_A_.  O!  I know what you mean--that is all arranged; he has an annuityof one hundred pounds per annum._B_.  My dear Ansard, you have exceeded my expectations; but now for theheroine._A_.  Yes, indeed; help me--for I have exhausted all my powers._B_.  It certainly requires much tact to present your heroine to yourreaders.  We are unfortunately denied what the ancients were so happy topossess,--a whole _cortege_ of divinities that might be summoned to helpany great personage in, or the author out of, a difficulty; but since wecannot command their assistance, like the man in the play who forgot hispart, we will do without it.  Now, have you thought of nothing new, forwe must not plagiarise even from fashionable novels?_A_.  I have thought--and thought--and can find nothing new, unless webring her in in a whirlwind: that has not yet been attempted._B_.  A whirlwind!  I don't know--that's hazardous.  Nevertheless, ifshe were placed on a beetling cliff, overhanging the tempestuous ocean,lashing the rocks with its wild surge; of a sudden, after she has beenpermitted to finish her soliloquy, a white cloud rising rapidly andunnoticed--the sudden vacuum--the rush of mighty winds through themajestic and alpine scenery--the vortex gathering round her--firstadmiring the vast efforts of nature; then astonished; and, lastly,alarmed, as she finds herself compelled to perform involuntarygyrations, till at length she spins round like a well-whipped top,nearing the dangerous edge of the precipice.  It is bold, and certainlyquite novel--I think it will do.  Portray her delicate little feet,peeping out, pointing downwards, the force of the elements raising heron her tip toes, now touching, now disdaining the earth.  Her dressexpanded wide like that of Herbele in her last and best pirouette--round, round she goes--her white arms are tossed frantically in the air.Corinne never threw herself into more graceful attitudes.  Now is seenher diminishing ankle--now the rounded symmetry--mustn't go too high upthough--the wind increases--her distance from the edge of the precipicedecreases--she has no breath left to shriek--no power to fall--threatened to be ravished by the wild and powerful god of the elements--she is discovered by the Honourable Augustus Bouverie, who has justfinished his soliloquy upon another adjacent hill.  He delights in herdanger--before he rushes to her rescue, makes one pause for the purposeof admiration, and another for the purpose of adjusting his shirtcollar._A_.  The devil he does!_B_.  To be sure.  The hero of a fashionable novel never loses caste.Whether in a storm, a whirlwind, up to his neck in the foaming ocean, ortumbling down a precipice, he is still the elegant and correctHonourable Augustus Bouverie.  To punish you for your interruption, Ihave a great mind to make him take a pinch of snuff before he starts.Well--he flies to her assistance--is himself caught in the rushingvortex, which prevents him from getting nearer to the lady, and, despiteof himself, takes to whirling in the opposite direction.  Theyapproach--they recede--she shrieks without being heard--holds out herarms for help--she would drop them in despair, but cannot, for they aretwisted over her head by the tremendous force of the element.  Onemoment they are near to each other, and the next they are separated; atone instant they are close to the abyss, and the waters below roar indelight of their anticipated victims, and in the next a favouring changeof the vortex increases their distance from the danger--there theyspin--and there you may leave them, and commence a new chapter._A_.  But is not all this naturally and physically impossible?_B_.  By no means; there is nothing supernatural in a whirlwind, and theeffect of a whirlwind is to twist everything round.  Why should theheroine and the Honourable Augustus Bouverie not be submitted to thelaws of nature? besides, we are writing a fashionable novel.  Wild andimprobable as this whirlwind may appear, it is within the range ofprobability: whereas, that is not at all adhered to in many novels--witness the drinking scene in --, and others equally _outrees_, in whichthe author, having turned probability out of doors, ends by throwingpossibility out of the window--leaving folly and madness to usurp theirplace--and play a thousand antics for the admiration of the public, who,pleased with novelty, cry out "How fine!"_A_.  Buy the book, and laud the author._B_.  Exactly.  Now, having left your hero and heroine in a situationpeculiarly interesting, with the greatest nonchalance, pass over to thecontinent, rave on the summit of Mont Blanc, and descant upon the stratawhich compose the mountains of the Moon in Central Africa.  You havebeen philosophical, now you must be geological.  No one can then saythat your book is light reading._A_.  That can be said of few novels.  In most of them even smokeassumes the ponderosity of lead._B_.  There is a metal still heavier, which they have the power ofcreating--gold--to pay a dunning tailor's bill._A_.  But after being philosophical and geological, ought one not to bea little moral._B_.  Pshaw!  I thought you had more sense.  The great art ofnovel-writing is to make the vices glorious, by placing them in closealliance with redeeming qualities.  Depend upon it, Ansard, there is adeeper, more heartfelt satisfaction that mere amusement innovel-reading; a satisfaction no less real, because we will not own itto ourselves; the satisfaction of seeing all our favourite and selfishideas dressed up in a garb so becoming, that we persuade ourselves thatour false pride is proper dignity, our ferocity courage, our cowardiceprudence, our irreligion liberality, and our baser appetites, meregallantry._A_.  Very true, Barnstaple; but really I do not like this whirlwind._B_.  Well, well!  I give it up then: it was your own idea.  We'll tryagain.  Cannot you create some difficulty or dilemma, in which to throwher, so that the hero may come to her rescue with _eclat_._A_.  Her grey palfrey takes fright._B_.  So will your readers; stale--quite stale!_A_.  A wild bull has his horns close to her, and is about to toss her._B_.  As your book would be!--away with contempt.  Vapid--quite vapid!_A_.  A shipwreck--the waves are about to close over her._B_.  Your book would be closed at the same moment--worn out--quite wornout._A_.  In the dead of the night, a fire breaks out--she is already in themidst of the flames--_B_.  Where your book would also be by the disgusted reader--worse andworse._A_.  Confound it--you will not allow me to expose her to earth, air,fire, or water.  I have a great mind to hang her in her garters, andmake the hero come and cut her down._B_.  You might do worse--and better._A_.  What--hang myself?_B_.  That certainly would put an end to all your difficulties.  But,Ansard, I think I can put your heroine in a situation really criticaland eminently distressing, and the hero shall come to her relief, likethe descent of a god to the rescue of a Greek or Trojan warrior._A_.  Or of Bacchus to Ariadne in her distress._B_.  Perhaps a better simile.  The consequence will be, that eternalgratitude in the bosom of the maiden will prove the parent of eternallove, which eternity of passion will of course until they are married._A_.  I'm all attention._B_.  Get up a splendid dinner party for their first casual meeting.Place the company at table._A_.  Surely you are not going to choke her with the bone of a chicken._B_.  You surely are about to murder me, as Sampson did thePhilistines--_A_.  With the jaw-bone of a fashionable novel-writer, you mean._B_.  Exactly.  But to proceed:--they are seated at table; can youdescribe a grand dinner?_A_.  Certainly, I have partaken of more than one._B_.  Where?_A_.  I once sat down three hundred strong at the Freemasons' Tavern._B_.  Pshaw! a mere hog feed._A_.  Well, then, I dined with the late lord mayor._B_.  Still worse.  My dear Ansard, it is however of no consequence.Nothing is more difficult to attain, yet nothing is more easy todescribe, than a good dinner.  I was once reading a very fashionablenovel by a very fashionable bookseller, for the author is a merenonentity, and was very much surprised at the accuracy with which a gooddinner was described.  The mystery was explained a short timeafterwards, when casually taking up Eustache Eude's book in Sams'slibrary, I found that the author had copied it out exactly from theinjunctions of that celebrated gastronome.  You can borrow the book._A_.  Well, we will suppose that done; but I am all anxiety to know whatis the danger from which the heroine is to be rescued._B_.  I will explain.  There are two species of existence--that of meremortal existence, which is of little consequence, provided, like Caesar,the hero and heroine die decently: the other is of much greaterconsequence, which is fashionable existence.  Let them once lose castein that respect, and they are virtually dead, and one mistake, oneoversight, is a death-blow for which there is no remedy, and from whichthere is no recovery.  For instance, we will suppose our heroine to bequite confounded with the appearance of our hero--to have become_distraite, reveuse_--and, in short, to have lost her recollection andpresence of mind.  She has been assisted to _filet de soles_.  Say thatthe only sauce ever taken with them is _au macedoine_--this is offeredto her, and, at the same time, another, which to eat with the above dishwould be unheard of.  In her distraction she is about to take the wrongsauce--actually at the point of ruining herself for ever and committingsuicide upon her fashionable existence, while the keen grey eyes of SirAntinous Antibes, the arbiter of fashion, are fixed upon her.  At thisawful moment, which is for ever to terminate her fashionable existence,the Honourable Augustus Bouverie, who sits next to her, gently touchesher _seduisante_ sleeve--blandly smiling, he whispers to her that the_other_ is the sauce _macedoine_.  She perceives her mistake, tremblesat her danger, rewards him with a smile, which penetrates into thedeepest recesses of his heart, helps herself to the right sauce, darts alook of contemptuous triumph upon Sir Antinous Antibes, and, while sheis dipping her sole into the sauce, her soul expands with gratitude andlove._A_.  I see, I see.  Many thanks; my heroine is now a fair counterpartof my hero.  "Ah, sure a pair were never seen,  So justly form'd to meet by nature."_B_.  And now I'll give you another hint, since you appear grateful.  Itis a species of clap-trap in a novel, which always takes--to wit, a richold uncle or misanthrope, who, at the very time that he is bitterlyoffended and disgusted with the hero, who is in awkward circumstances,pulls out a pocketbook and counts down, say fifteen or twenty thousandpounds in bank notes, to relieve him from his difficulties.  An old coatand monosyllables will increase the interest._A_.  True.  (_sighing_.)  Alas! there are no such uncles in real life;I wish there were._B_.  I beg your pardon; I know no time in which _my uncle_ forks outmore bank notes than at present._A_.  Yes, but it is for value, or more than value, received._B_.  That I grant; but I am afraid it is the only "uncle" left now;except in a fashionable novel.  But you comprehend the value of this newauxiliary._A_.  Nothing can be better.  Barnstaple, you are really --, but I sayno more.  If a truly great man cannot be flattered with delicacy, itmust not be attempted at all; silence then becomes the best tribute.Your advice proves you to be truly great.  I am silent, therefore youunderstand the full force of the oratory of my thanks._B (bowing_.)  Well, Ansard, you have found out the cheapest way ofpaying off your bills of gratitude I ever heard of.  "Poor, even inthanks," was well said by Shakespeare; but you, it appears, are rich, inhaving nothing at all wherewith to pay.  If you could transfer the samedoctrine to your tradesmen, you need not write novels._A_.  Alas! my dear fellow, mine is not yet written.  There is oneimportant feature, nay, the most important feature of all--the style oflanguage, the diction--on that, Barnstaple, you have not yetdoctrinated._B (pompously_.)  When Demosthenes was asked what were the principalattributes of eloquence, he answered, that the first was action; onbeing asked which was the second, he replied, action; and the third,action; and such is the idea of the Irish _mimbers_ in the House ofCommons.  Now there are three important requisites in the diction of afashionable novel.  The first, my dear fellow, is--flippancy; thesecond, flippancy; and flippancy is also the third.  With the dull itwill pass for wit, with some it will pass for scorn,--and even the wittywill not be enabled to point out the difference, without running therisk of being considered invidious.  It will cover every defect with adefect still greater; for who can call small beer tasteless when it issour, or dull when it is bottled and has a froth upon it?_A_.  The advice is excellent; but I fear that this flippancy is asdifficult to acquire an the tone of true eloquence._B_.  Difficult!  I defy the writers of the silver-fork school to writeout of the style flippant.  Read but one volume of --, and you will besaturated with it; but if you wish to go to the fountain-head, do ashave done most of the late fashionable novel-writers, repair to theirinstructors--the lady's-maid, for flippancy in the vein _spirituelle_!to a London footman for the vein critical; but, if you wish a flippancyof a still higher order, at once more solemn and more empty, which Iwould call the vein political, read the speeches of some of our membersof Parliament.  Only read them, I wish no man so ill an to inflict uponhim the torture of hearing them--read them, I say, and you will havetaken the very highest degree in the order of inane flippancy._A_.  I see it at once.  Your observations are as true as they aresevere.  When we would harangue geese, we must condescend to hiss; butstill, my dear Barnstaple, though you have fully proved to me that in afashionable novel all plot is unnecessary, don't you think there oughtto be a catastrophe, or sort of a kind of an end to the work, or thereader may be brought up short, or as the sailors say, "all standing,"when he comes to the word "Finis," and exclaim with an air ofstupefaction--"And then--"_B_.  And then, if he did, it would be no more than the fool deserved.I don't know whether it would not be advisable to leave off in themiddle of a sentence, of a word, nay of a syllable, if it be possible: Iam sure the winding-up would be better than the lackadaisicalrunning-down of most of the fashionable novels.  Snap the mainspring ofyour watch, and none but an ass can expect you to tell by it what it iso'clock; snap the thread of your narrative in the same way, and he mustbe an unreasonable being who would expect a reasonable conclusion.Finish thus, in a case of delicate distress; say, "The Honourable MrAugustus Bouverie was struck in a heap with horror.  He rushed with afrantic grace, a deliberate haste, and a graceful awkwardness, andwhispered in her ear these dread and awful words, `IT IS TOO LATE!'"Follow up with a -- and Finis._A_.  I see; the fair and agitated reader will pass a sleepless night inendeavouring to decipher the mutilated sentence.  She will fail, andconsequently call the book delightful.  But should there not have been amarriage previously to this happy awful climax?_B_.  Yes; everything is arranged for the nuptials--carriages are senthome, jewellery received but not paid for, dresses all tried on, theparty invited--nay, assembled in the blue-and-white drawing-room.  Theright reverend my lord bishop is standing behind the temporary altar--hehas wiped his spectacles and thumbed his prayer-book--all eyes areturned towards the door, which opens not--the bride faints, for thebridegroom cometh not--he's not "i' the vein"--a something, as likenothing as possible, has given him a disgust that is surmountable--heflings his happiness to the winds, though he never loved with moreoutrageous intensity than at the moment he discards his mistress; so hefights three duels with the two brothers and father.  He wounds one ofthe young men dangerously, the other slightly; fires his pistol in theair when he meets her father--for how could he take the life of him whogave life to his adored one?  Your hero can always hit a man just wherehe pleases--vide every novel in Mr C's collection.  The hero becomesmisanthropical, the heroine maniacal.  The former marries an antiquatedand toothless dowager, as an escape from the imaginary disgust he tookat a sight of a matchless woman; and the latter marries an old brute,who threatens her life every night, and puts her in bodily fear everymorning, as an indemnity in full for the loss of the man of heraffections.  They are both romantically miserable; and then comes onyour tantalising scenes of delicate distress, and so the end of yourthird volume, and then finish without any end at all.  _Verb. sap. sat_.Or, if you like it better, kill the old dowager of a surfeit, and makethe old brute who marries the heroine commit suicide; and, after allthese unheard-of trials, marry them as fresh and beautiful as ever._A_.  A thousand thanks.  Your _verba_ are not thrown to a _sap_.  Can Ipossibly do you any favour for all this kindness?_B_.  Oh, my dear fellow! the very greatest.  As I see yours will be, atall points, a most fashionable novel, do me the inestimable favour _not_to ask me _to read it_.CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.HOW TO WRITE A BOOK OF TRAVELS.MR ANSARD'S _Chambers_._Ansard_.  (alone.)  Well, I thought it hard enough to write a novel atthe dictate of the bibliopolist; but to be condemned to sit down andwrite my travels--travels that have never extended farther than theLincoln's Inn Coffee House for my daily food, and a walk to Hampstead ona Sunday.  These travels to be swelled into Travels up the Rhine in theyear 18--.  Why, it's impossible.  O that Barnstaple were here, for hehas proved my guardian angel!  Lazy, clever dog!_Enter_ BARNSTAPLE._Barnstaple_.  Pray, my dear Ansard, to whom did you apply that lastepithet?_Ansard_.  My dear Barnstaple, I never was more happy to see you.  Sitdown, I have much to tell you, all about myself and my difficulties._Barnstaple_.  The conversation promises to be interesting to me, at allevents._Ansard_.  Everything is interesting to true friendship._Barnstaple_.  Now I perceive that you do want something.  Well, beforeyou state your case, tell me, how did the novel go off?_Ansard_.  Wonderfully well.  It was ascribed to Lord G--: the baittook, and 750 went off in a first edition, and the remainder of thecopies printed went off in a second._Barnstaple_.  Without being reprinted?_Ansard_.  Exactly.  I was surprised at my success, and told mypublisher so; but he answered that he could sell an edition of any trashhe pleased._Barnstaple_.  That was not flattering._Ansard_.  Not very; but his bill was honoured, and that consoled me.However, to proceed to business--he has given me another order--AJourney up the Rhine, in two volumes, large octavo, in the year 18--.Now, Barnstaple, what's to be done?_Barnstaple_.  Write it, to be sure._Ansard_.  But you well know I have never been out of England in mylife._Barnstaple_.  Never mind, write it._Ansard_.  Yes, it's very well to say write it; but how the devil am Ito write it?  Write what I have never seen--detail events which neveroccurred--describe views of that which I have not even an idea--travelpost in my old arm-chair.  It's all very well to say write it, but tellme, how._Barnstaple_.  I say again, write it, and pocket the money.  Ansard,allow me to state that you are a greenhorn.  I will make this mountainof difficulties vanish and melt away like snow before the powerful raysof the sun.  You are told to write what you have never seen; but if youhave not, others have, which will serve your purpose just as well.  Todetail events which have never occurred--invent them, they will be moreamusing.  Describe views, etcetera, of which you are ignorant--so aremost of your readers; but have we not the art of engraving to assistyou?  To travel post in your arm-chair--a very pleasant and a veryprofitable way of travelling, as you have not to pay for the horses andpostilions, and are not knocked to pieces by continental roads.  Dependupon it, the best travels are those written at home, by those who havenever put their foot into the Calais packet-boat._Ansard_.  To me this is all a mystery.  I certainly must be agreenhorn, as you observe._Barnstaple_.  Why, Ansard, my dear fellow, with a book of roads and agazetteer, I would write a more amusing book of travels than one halfwhich are now foisted on the public.  All you have to do is to fill upthe chinks._Ansard_.  All I want to do is to fill up the chinks in my stomach,Barnstaple; for, between you and me, times are rather queer._Barnstaple_.  You shall do it, if you will follow my advice.  I taughtyou how to write a fashionable novel; it will be hard, indeed, if Icannot send you up the Rhine.  One little expense must be incurred--youmust subscribe a quarter to a circulating library, for I wish that whatyou do should be well done._Ansard_.  Barnstaple, I will subscribe to--anything._Barnstaple_.  Well, then, since you are so reasonable, I will proceed.You must wade through all the various "Journeys on the Rhine", "TwoMonths on the Rhine", "Autumns on the Rhine," etcetera, which you cancollect.  This you will find the most tiresome part of your task.Select one as your guide, one who has a reputation; follow his course,not exactly--that I will explain afterwards--and agree with him in everything, generally speaking.  Praise his exactitude and fidelity, andoccasionally quote him; this is but fair; after you rob a man (and Iintend you shall rifle him most completely), it is but decent to givehim kind words.  All others you must abuse, contradict, and depreciate.Now, there is a great advantage in so doing: in the first place, youmake the best writer your friend--he forgets your larcenies in yourcommendation of him, and in your abuse of others.  If his work becorrect, so must yours be; he praises it everywhere--perhaps finds youout, and asks you to dine with him._Ansard_.  How should I ever look at his injured face?_Barnstaple_.  On the contrary, he is the obliged party--your travelsare a puff to his own._Ansard_.  But, Barnstaple, allowing that I follow this part of youradvice, which I grant to be very excellent, how can I contradict others,when they may be, and probably are, perfectly correct in theirassertions?_Barnstaple_.  If they are so, virtue must be its own reward.  It isnecessary that you write a book of travels, and all travellerscontradict each other--ergo, you must contradict, or nobody will believethat you have travelled.  Not only contradict, but sneer at them._Ansard_.  Well, now do explain how that is to be done._Barnstaple_.  Nothing more simple: for instance, a man measures acertain remarkable piece of antiquity--its length is 747 feet.  You mustmeasure it over again, and declare that he is in error, that it is only727.  To be sure of your being correct, measure it _twice_ over, andthen convict him._Ansard_.  But surely, Barnstaple, one who has measured it is morelikely to be correct than one who has not._Barnstaple_.  I'll grant you that he is correct to half an inch--that'sno matter.  The public will, in all probability, believe you, becauseyou are the last writer, and because you have _decreased_ thedimensions.  Travellers are notorious for amplification, and if thepublic do not believe you, let them go and measure it themselves._Ansard_.  A third traveller may hereafter measure it, and find that Iam in the wrong._Barnstaple_.  Ten to one if you are not both in the wrong; but whatmatter will that be? your book will have been sold._Ansard_.  Most true, O king!  I perceive now the general outline, and Ifeel confident that, with your kind assistance, I may accomplish it.But, Barnstaple, the beginning is everything.  If I only had the firstchapter as a start, I think I could get on.  It is the _modus_ that Iwant--the style.  A first chapter would be a key-note for the remainderof the tune, with all the variations._Barnstaple_.  Well, then, take up your pen.  But before I commence, itmay be as well to observe, that there is a certain method required, evenin writing travels.  In every chapter you should have certain landmarksto guide you.  For instance, enumerate the following, and select theworks from which they may be obtained, so as to mix up the instructivewith the amusing.  Travelling--remarks on country passed through--anecdote--arrival at a town--churches--population--historical remarks--another anecdote--eating and drinking--natural curiosities--egotism--remarks on the women (never mind the men)--another anecdote--reflections--an adventure--and go to bed.  You understand, Ansard, thatin these memoranda you have all that is required; the rule is not to befollowed absolutely, but generally.  As you observed, such is to be thetune, but your variations may be infinite.  When at a loss, or you thinkyou are dull, always call in a grisette, and a little mystery; and,above all, never be afraid of talking too much about yourself._Ansard_.  Many, many thanks; but now, my dear Barnstaple, for the firstchapter._Barnstaple_.  Let your style be flowery--I should say florid--nevermind a false epithet or two in a page, they will never be observed.  Agreat deal depends upon the first two pages--you must not limp atstarting; we will, therefore, be particular.  Take your pen.                   [BARNSTAPLE _muses for a while, and then continues_.]"A severe cough, which refused to yield even to the balmy influence ofthe genial spring of 18--, and threatened a pulmonary complaint, inducedme to yield to the reiterated persuasions of my physicians to try achange of air, as most likely to ward off the threatened danger.  Whereto direct my steps was the difficult point to ascertain.  Brighton,Torquay, Cromer, Ilfracombe, had all been visited and revisited.  Ateither of these fashionable resorts I was certain to fall in with anumerous acquaintance, whose persuasions would have induced me to departfrom that regularity of diet and of rest, so imperiously insisted uponby my medical advisers.  After much cogitation, I resolved upon ajourney up the Rhine, and to escape the ruthless winter of our northernclime in the more genial land of history."_Ansard_.  Land of history--I presume you mean Italy; but am I to gothere?_Barnstaple_.  No, you may recover, and come back again to skate uponthe Serpentine, if you please.  You observe, Ansard, I have not made youa fellow with 50 pounds in his pocket, setting out to turn it into 300pounds by a book of travels.  I have avoided mention of Margate,Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and all common watering-places; I have talked ofphysicians in the plural; in short, no one who reads that paragraph, butwill suppose that you are a young man of rank and fortune, to whom moneyis no object, and who spends hundreds to cure that which might beeffected by a little regularity, and a few doses of ipecacuanha._Ansard_.  I wish it were so.  Nevertheless, I'll travel _en grandseigneur_--thats more agreeable even in imagination, than being rumbledin a "_diligence_."_Barnstaple_.  And will produce more respect for your work, I can assureyou.  But to proceed.  Always, when you leave England, talk about_hospitality_.  The English like it.  Have you no relations or friendsin whose opinion you wish to stand well?  Public mention in print doeswonders, especially with a copy handsomely bound "from the author."_Ansard_.  Really, Barnstaple, I do not know any one.  My poor mother isin Cumberland, and that is not _en route_.  I have a maternal uncle ofthe name of Forster, who lives on the road--a rich, old, miserlybachelor; but I can't say much for his hospitality.  I have called uponhim twice, and he has never even asked me to dinner._Barnstaple_.  Never mind.  People like being praised for a virtue whichthey do not possess--it may prove a legacy.  Say, then, that you quittedthe hospitable roof of your worthy and excellent-hearted relation, MrForster and felt--_Ansard_.  Felt how?_Barnstaple_.  How--why you felt, as he wrung your hand, that there wasa sudden dissolution of the ties of kindred and affection._Ansard_.  There always has been in that quarter, so my conscience is sofar clear._Barnstaple_.  You arrive at Dovor (mind you spell it Dovor)--go to bedtired and reflective--embark early the next morning--a rough passage--_Ansard_.  And sea-sick, of course?_Barnstaple_.  No, Ansard; there I'll give you a proof of my tact--youshan't be sea-sick._Ansard_.  But I'm sure I should be._Barnstaple_.  All travellers are, and all fill up a page or two withcomplaints, _ad nauseam_--for that reason sick you shall not be.Observe--to your astonishment you are not sea-sick: the other passengerssuffer dreadfully; one young dandy puffs furiously at a cigar inbravado, until he sends it over the side, like an arrow from theblow-pipe of a South American Indian.  Introduce a husband with a prettywife--he jealous as a dog, until he is sick as a cat--your attentions--she pillowed on your arms, while he hangs over the lee gunwale--hergratitude--safe arrival at Calais--sweet smiles of the lady--sullendeportment of the gentleman--a few hints--and draw the veil.  Do youunderstand?_Ansard_.  Perfectly.  I can manage all that._Barnstaple_.  Then when you put your foot on shore, you must, for thefirst time, _feel sea-sick_._Ansard_.  On shore?_Barnstaple_.  Yes; reel about, not able to stand--every symptom as ifon board.  Express your surprise at the strange effect, pretend not toexplain it, leave that to medical men, it being sufficient for you tostate the _fact_._Ansard_.  The _fact_!  O Barnstaple!_Barnstaple_.  That will be a great hit for a first chapter.  Youreverse the order of things._Ansard_.  That I do most certainly.  Shall I finish the first chapterwith that _fact_?_Barnstaple_.  No.  Travellers always go to bed at the end of eachchapter.  It is a wise plan, and to a certain degree it must befollowed.  You must have a baggage adventure--be separated from it--somesharp little urchin has seized upon your valise--it is nowhere to befound--quite in despair--walk to the Hotel d'Angleterre, and find thatyou are met by the landlord and garcons, who inform you that yourcarriage is in the remise, and your rooms ready--ascend to yourbedroom--find that your baggage is not only there, but neatly laid out--your portmanteau unstrapped--your trunk uncorded--and the little rascalof a commissaire standing by with his hat in his hand, and a smile _demalice_, having installed _himself_ as your _domestique de place_--takehim for his impudence--praise the "_Cotelettes_ and the _vin deBeaune_"--wish the reader good night, and go to bed.  Thus ends thefirst chapter.[ANSARD _gets up and takes_ BARNSTAPLE'S _hand, which he shakes warmlywithout speaking_.  BARNSTAPLE _smiles and walks out_.  ANSARD _is lefthard at work at his desk_.]ARTHUR ANSARD _in his Chambers, solus, with his pen in his hand_._Ansard_.  Capital! that last was a _hit_.  It has all the appearance ofreality.  To be sure, I borrowed the hint, but that nobody will be ableto prove.  (_Yawns_.)  Heigho!  I have only got half way on my journeyyet, and my ideas are quite exhausted.  I am as much worn out anddistressed as one of the German post-horses which I described in my lastchapter.  (_Nods, and then falls fast asleep_.)BARNSTAPLE _taps at the door; receiving no answer, he enters_._Barnstaple_.  So--quite fast.  What can have put him to sleep?  (_Readsthe manuscript on the table_.)  No wonder, enough to put anybody tosleep apparently.  Why, Ansard!_Ansard_.  (_starting up, still half asleep_.)  Already?  Why, I'vehardly shut my eyes.  Well, I'll be dressed directly; let them get some_cafe_ ready below.  Henri, did you order the hind-spring to berepaired!  (_Nods again with his eyes shut_.)_Barnstaple_.  Hallo!  What now, Ansard, do you really think that youare travelling?_Ansard_.  (_waking up_).  Upon my word, Barnstaple, I was so dreaming.I thought I was in my bed at the Hotel de Londres, after the fatiguingday's journey I described yesterday.  I certainly have written myselfinto the conviction that I was travelling post._Barnstaple_.  All the better--you have embodied yourself in your ownwork, which every writer of fiction ought to do; but they can seldomattain to such a desideratum.  Now, tell me, how do you get on?_Ansard_.  Thank you--pretty well.  I have been going it with fourpost-horses these last three weeks._Barnstaple_.  And how far have you got?_Ansard_.  Half way--that is, into the middle of my second volume.  ButI'm very glad that you're come to my assistance, Barnstaple; for to tellyou the truth, I was breaking down._Barnstaple_.  Yes, you said something about the hind-spring of yourcarriage._Ansard_.  That I can repair without your assistance; but my spirits arebreaking down.  I want society.  This travelling post is dull work.Now, if I could introduce a companion--_Barnstaple_.  So you shall.  At the next town that you stop at, buy a_Poodle_._Ansard_.  A _Poodle_!  Barnstaple?  How the devil shall I be assistedby a poodle?_Barnstaple_.  He will prove a more faithful friend to you in yourexigence, and a better companion than one of your own species.  A malecompanion, after all, is soon expended, and a female, which would bemore agreeable, is not admissible.  If you admit a young traveller intoyour carriage--what then?  He is handsome, pleasant, romantic, and soforth; but you must not give his opinions in contradiction to your own,and if they coincide, it is superfluous.  Now, a poodle is a dog ofparts, and it is more likely that you fall in with a sagacious dog thanwith a sagacious man.  The poodle is the thing; you must recount yourmeeting, his purchase, size, colour, and qualifications, and anecdotesof his sagacity, vouched for by the landlord, and all the _garcons_ ofthe hotel.  As you proceed on your travels, his attachment to youincreases, and wind up every third chapter with "your faithful Mouton."_Ansard_.  Will not all that be considered frivolous?_Barnstaple_.  Frivolous! by no means.  The frivolous will like it, andthose who may have more sense, although they may think that Mouton doesnot at all assist your travelling researches, are too well acquaintedwith the virtues of the canine race, and the attachment insensiblyimbibed for so faithful an attendant, not to forgive your affectionatemention of him.  Besides it will go far to assist the verisimilitude ofyour travels.  As for your female readers, they will prefer Mouton evento you._Ansard_.  All-powerful and mighty magician, whose wand of humbug, likethat of Aaron's, swallows up all others, not excepting that of divineTruth, I obey you!  Mouton shall be summoned to my aid: he shallflourish, and my pen shall flourish in praise of his endlessperfections.  But, Barnstaple, what shall I give for him?_Barnstaple_.  (_thinks awhile_.)  Not less than forty louis._Ansard_.  Forty louis for a poodle!_Barnstaple_.  Most certainly; not a sou less.  The value of any thingin the eyes of the world is exactly what it costs.  Mouton, at afive-franc piece, would excite no interest; and his value to the readerwill increase in proportion to his price, which will be considered anundeniable proof of all his wonderful sagacity, with which you are toamuse the reader._Ansard_.  But in what is to consist his sagacity?_Barnstaple_.  He must do everything but speak.  Indeed, he must so farspeak as to howl the first part of "Lieber Augustin."_Ansard_.  His instinct shall put our boasted reason to the blush.But--I think I had better not bring him home with me._Barnstaple_.  Of course not.  In the first place, it's absolutelynecessary to kill him, lest his reputation should induce people to seekhim out, which they would do, although, in all probability, they neverwill his master.  Lady Cork would certainly invite him to a literary_soiree_.  You must therefore kill him in the most effective waypossible, and you will derive the advantage of filling up at least tenpages with his last moments--licking your hand, your own lamentations,violent and inconsolable grief on the part of Henri, and tanning hisskin as a memorial._Ansard_.  A beautiful episode, for which receive my best thanks.  But,Barnstaple, I have very few effective passages as yet.  I haveremodelled several descriptions of mountains, precipices, waterfalls,and such wonders of the creation--expressed my contempt and surprise atthe fear acknowledged by other travellers, in several instances.  I havelost my way twice--met three wolves--been four times benighted--andindebted to lights at a distance for a bed at midnight, after the horseshave refused to proceed.  All is incident, and I am quite hard up fordescription.  Now, I have marked down a fine passage in --'s work--abeautiful description of a cathedral with a grand procession.(_Reads_.) "What with the effect of the sun's brightest beams upon theancient glass windows--various hues reflected upon the gothic pillars--gorgeousness of the procession--sacerdotal ornaments--tossing ofcensers--crowds of people--elevation of the host, and sinking down ofthe populace _en masse_."  It really is a magnificent line of writing,and which my work requires.  One or two like that in my book would dowell to be quoted by impartial critics, before the public are permittedto read it.  But here, you observe, is a difficulty.  I dare not borrowthe passage._Barnstaple_.  But you shall borrow it--you shall be even finer than heis, and yet he shall not dare to accuse you of plagiarism._Ansard_.  How is that possible, my dear Barnstaple?  I am allimpatience._Barnstaple_.  His description is at a certain hour of the day.  All youhave to do is to portray the scene in nearly the same words.  You haveas much right to visit a cathedral as he has, and as for the rest--hereis the secret.  You must visit it at _night_.  Instead of "gloriousbeams," you will talk of "pale melancholy light;" instead of "thestained windows throwing their various hues upon the gothic pile," youmust "darken the massive pile, and light up the windows with the silverrays of the moon."  The glorious orb of day must give place to thousandsof wax tapers--the splendid fret--work of the roof you must regret wasnot to be clearly distinguished--but you must be in ecstasies with thebroad light and shade--the blaze at the altar--solemn hour of night--feelings of awe--half a Catholic--religious reflections, etcetera.Don't you perceive?_Ansard_.  I do.  Like the rest of my work, it shall be all _moonshine_.It shall be done, Barnstaple; but have you not another idea or two tohelp me with?_Barnstaple_.  Have you talked about cooks?_Ansard_.  As yet, not a word._Barnstaple_.  By this time you ought to have some knowledge ofgastronomy.  Talk seriously about eating._Ansard_.  (_writes_.)  I have made a memo._Barnstaple_.  Have you had no affront?_Ansard_.  Not one.B.  Then be seriously affronted--complain to the burgomaster, or mayor,or commandant, whoever it may be--they attempt to bully--you areresolute and firm as an Englishman--insist upon being righted--they mustmake you a thousand apologies.  This will tickle the national vanity,and be read with interest._Ansard_.  (_writes_.)  I have been affronted.  Anything else which mayproceed from your prolific brain, Barnstaple?_Barnstaple_.  Have you had a serious illness?_Ansard_.  Never complained even of a headache._Barnstaple_.  Then do everything but die--Henri weeping andinconsolable--Mouton howling at the foot of your bed--kick the surgeonsout of the room--and cure yourself with three dozen of champagne._Ansard_.  (_writes_.)  Very sick--cured with three dozen of champagne--I wish the illness would in reality come on, if I were certain of thecure _gratis_.  Go on, my dear Barnstaple._Barnstaple_.  You may work in an episode here--delirium--lucidintervals--gentle female voice--delicate attentions--mysteriousdiscovery from loquacious landlady--eternal gratitude--but no marriage--an apostrophe--and all the rest left to conjecture._Ansard_.  (_writes down_.)  Silent attentions--conjecture--I can managethat, I think._Barnstaple_.  By the bye, have you brought in Madame de Stael?_Ansard_.  No--how the devil am I to bring her in?_Barnstaple_.  As most other travellers do, by the head and shoulders.Never mind that, so long as you bring her in._Ansard_.  (_writes_).  Madame de Stael by the shoulders--that's notvery polite towards a lady.  These hints are invaluable; pray go on._Barnstaple_.  Why, you have already more hints this morning than aresufficient for three volumes.  But, however, let me see.  (_Barnstaplethinks a little_).  Find yourself short of cash._Ansard_.  A sad reality, Barnstaple.  I shall write this part well, fortruth will guide my pen._Barnstaple_.  All the better.  But to continue--no remittances--awkwardposition--explain your situation--receive credit to any amount--andcompliment your countrymen._Ansard_.  (_writes_.)  Credit to any amount--pleasing idea.  But Idon't exactly perceive the value of this last hint, Barnstaple._Barnstaple_.  All judicious travellers make it a point, throughout thewhole of their works, to flatter the nation upon its wealth, name, andreputation in foreign countries; by doing so you will be read greedily,and praised in due proportion.  If ever I were to write my travels intothe interior of Africa, or to the North Pole, I would make it a point todiscount a bill at Timbuctoo, or get a cheque cashed by the Esquimaux,without the least hesitation in either case.  I think now, that whatwith your invention, your plagiarism, and my hints, you ought to producea very effective Book of Travels; and with that feeling I shall leaveyou to pursue your Journey, and receive, at its finale, your justreward.  When we meet again, I hope to see you advertised._Ansard_.  Yes, but not exposed, I trust.  I am _incognito_, you know._Barnstaple_.  To be sure, that will impart an additional interest toyour narrative.  All the world will be guessing who you may be.  Adieu,voyageur.  [_Exit_ BARNSTAPLE.]_Ansard_.  And Heaven forfend that they should find me out!  But whatcan be done?  In brief, I cannot get a brief, and thus I exercise myprofessional acquirements how I can, proving myself as long-winded, asprosy perhaps, and certainly as lying, as the more fortunate of myfraternity.CHAPTER FORTY NINE.HOW TO WRITE A ROMANCE.MR ARTHUR ANSARD, _standing at his table, selecting a steel pen from acard on which a dozen are ranged up, like soldiers on parade_.I must find a regular _graver_ to write this chapter of horrors.  Nogoose quill could afford me any assistance.  Now then.  Let mesee--(_Reads, and during his reading_ BARNSTAPLE _comes in at the doorbehind him, unperceived_.) "At this most monstrously appalling sight,the hair of Piftlianteriscki raised slowly the velvet cap from off hishead, as if it had been perched upon the rustling quills of someexasperated porcupine--(I think that's new)--his nostrils dilated tothat extent that you might, with ease, have thrust a musket bullet intoeach--his mouth was opened so wide, so unnaturally wide, that thecorners were rent asunder, and the blood slowly trickled down each sideof his bristly chin--while each tooth loosened from its socket withindividual fear.--Not a word could he utter, for his tongue, in itsfright, clung with terror to his upper jaw, as tight as do the belliesof the fresh and slimy soles, paired together by some fisherwoman; butif his tongue was paralysed, his heart was not--it throbbed against hisribs with a violence which threatened their dislocation from thesternum, and with a sound which reverberated through the dark, dampsubterrene--" I think that will do.  There's _force_ there._Barnstaple_.  There is, with a vengeance.  Why, what is all this?_Ansard_.  My dear Barnstaple, you here!  I'm writing a romance for B--.It is to be supposed to be a translation._Barnstaple_.  The Germans will be infinitely obliged to you; but, mydear fellow, you appear to have fallen into the old school--that's nolonger in vogue._Ansard_.  My orders are for the old school.  B-- was most particular onthat point.  He says that there is a re-action--a great re-action._Barnstaple_.  What, on literature?  Well, he knows as well as any man.I only wish to God there was in everything else, and we could see thegood old times again._Ansard_.  To confess the truth, I did intend to have finished thiswithout saying a word to you.  I wished to have surprised you._Barnstaple_.  So you have, my dear fellow, with the few lines I haveheard.  How the devil are you to get your fellow out of that state ofasphyxia?_Ansard_.  By degrees--slowly--very slowly--as they pretend that welawyers go to heaven.  But I'll tell you what I have done, just to giveyou an idea of my work.  In the first place, I have a castle perched sohigh up in the air, that the eagles, even in their highest soar, appearbut as wrens below._Barnstaple_.  That's all right._Ansard_.  And then it has subterraneous passages, to which the sewersof London are a mere song; and they all lead to a small cave athigh-water mark on the sea-beach, covered with brambles and bushes, andjust large enough at its entrance to admit of a man squeezing himselfin:_Barnstaple_.  That's all right.  You cannot be too much underground; infact, the two first, and the best part of the third volume, should bewholly in the bowels of the earth, and your hero and heroine shouldnever _come to light_ until the last chapter._Ansard_.  Then they would never have been born till then, and how couldI marry them?  But still I have adhered pretty much to your idea; and,Barnstaple, I have such a heroine--such a love--she has never seen hersweetheart, yet she is most devotedly attached, and has suffered morefor his sake than any mortal could endure._Barnstaple_.  Most heroines generally do._Ansard_.  I have had her into various dungeons for three or four years,on black bread and a broken pitcher of water--she has been starved todeath--lain for months and months upon wet straw--had two brain fevers--five times has she risked violation, and always has picked up, or foundin the belt of her infamous ravishers, a stiletto, which she has plungedinto their hearts, and they have expired with or without a groan._Barnstaple_.  Excellent: and of course comes out of her dungeons eachtime as fresh, as sweet, as lovely, as pure, as charming, and asconstant as ever._Ansard_.  Exactly; nothing can equal her infinite variety of adventure,and her imperishable beauty and unadhesive cleanliness of person; and,as for lives, she has more than a thousand cats'.  After nine months'confinement in a dungeon, four feet square, when it is opened for herrelease, the air is perfumed with the ambrosia which exhales from hersweet person._Barnstaple_.  Of course it does.  The only question is, what ambrosiasmells like.  But let me know something about your hero._Ansard_.  He is a prince and a robber._Barnstaple_.  The two professions are not at all incompatible.  Go on._Ansard_.  He is the chief of a band of robbers, and is here, there andeverywhere.  He fills all Europe with terror, admiration, and love._Barnstaple_.  Very good._Ansard_.  His reasons for joining the robbers are, of course, a secret(and upon my word they are equally a secret to myself); but it iswonderful the implicit obedience of his men, and the many acts ofgenerosity of which he is guilty.  I make him give away a great dealmore money than his whole band ever take, which is so far awkward, thatthe query may arise in what way he keeps them together, and suppliesthem with food and necessaries._Barnstaple_.  Of course with _IOUs_ upon his princely domains._Ansard_.  I have some very grand scenes, amazingly effective; forinstance, what do you think, at the moment after the holy mass has beenperformed in Saint Peter's at Rome, just as the pope is about to put thesacred wafer into his mouth and bless the whole world, I make him snatchthe wafer out of the pope's hand, and get clear off with it._Barnstaple_.  What for, may I ask?_Ansard_.  That is a secret which I do not reveal.  The wholearrangement of that part of the plot is admirable.  The band of robbersare disguised as priests, and officiate, without being found out._Barnstaple_.  But isn't that rather sacrilegious?_Ansard_.  No; it appears so to be, but he gives his reasons for hisbehaviour to the pope, and the pope is satisfied, and not only gives himhis blessing, but shows him the greatest respect._Barnstaple_.  They must have been very weighty reasons._Ansard_.  And therefore they are not divulged._Barnstaple_.  That is to say, not until the end of the work._Ansard_.  They are never divulged at all; I leave a great deal to thereader's imagination--people are fond of conjecture.  All they know is,that he boldly appears, and demands an audience.  He is conducted in,the interview is private, after a sign made by our hero, and at whichthe pope almost leaps off the chair.  After an hour he comes out again,and the pope bows him to the very door.  Every one is astonished, and,of course, almost canonise him._Barnstaple_.  That's going it rather strong in a Catholic country.  Buttell me, Ansard, what is your plot?_Ansard_.  Plot; I have none._Barnstaple_.  No plot!_Ansard_.  No plot, and all plot.  I puzzle the reader with certainmaterials.  I have castles and dungeons, corridors and creaking doors,good villains and bad villains.  Chain armour and clank of armour,daggers for gentlemen, and stilettoes for ladies.  Dark forests andbrushwood, drinking scenes, eating scenes, and sleeping scenes--robbersand friars, purses of gold and instruments of torture, an incarnatedevil of a Jesuit, a handsome hero, and a lovely heroine.  I jumble themall together, sometimes above, and sometimes underground, and I explainnothing at all._Barnstaple_.  Have you nothing supernatural?_Ansard_.  O yes!  I've a dog whose instinct is really supernatural, andI have two or three visions, which may be considered so, as they tellwhat never else could have been known.  I decorate my caverns anddungeons with sweltering toads and slimy vipers, a constant dropping ofwater, with chains too ponderous to lift, but which the parties uponwhom they are riveted, clang together as they walk up and down in theircells, and soliloquise.  So much for my underground scenery.  Above, Ipeople the halls with pages and ostrich feathers, and knights in brightarmour, a constant supply of generous wine, and goblets too heavy tolift, which the knights toss off at a draught, as they sit and listen tothe minstrel's music._Barnstaple_.  Bravo, Ansard, bravo.  It appears to me that you do notwant assistance in this romance._Ansard_.  No, when I do I have always a holy and compassionate friar,who pulls a wonderful restorative or healing balm, out of his bosom.The puffs of Solomon's Balm of Gilead are a fool to the real merits ofmy pharmacopoeia contained in a small vial._Barnstaple_.  And pray what may be the title of this book of yours, forI have known it take more time to fix upon a title than to write thethree volumes._Ansard_.  I call it _The Undiscovered Secret_, and very properly sotoo, for it never is explained.  But if you please, I will read you somepassages from it.  I think you will approve of them.  For instance, nowlet us take this, in the second volume.  You must know, thatAngelicanarinella (for that is the name of my heroine) is thrown into adungeon not more than four feet square, but more than six hundred feetbelow the surface of the earth.  The ways are so intricate, and thesubterranean so vast, and the dungeons so numerous, that the baseEthiop, who has obeyed his master's orders in confining her, has himselfbeen lost in the labyrinth, and has not been able to discover whatdungeon he put her in.  For three days he has been looking for it,during which our heroine has been without food, and he is stillsearching and scratching his woolly head in despair, as he is to die byslow torture, if he does not reproduce her--for you observe, the chiefwho has thrown her into his dungeon is most desperately in love withher._Barnstaple_.  That of course; and that is the way to prove romanticlove--you ill treat--but still she is certainly in a dilemma, as well asthe Ethiop._Ansard_.  Granted; but she talks like the heroine of a romance.Listen.  (ANSARD _reads_.) "The beauteous and divinely moulded form ofthe angelic Angelicanarinella pressed the dank and rotten straw whichhad been thrown down by the scowling, thick-lipped Ethiop for herrepose--she, for whom attendant maidens had smoothed the Sybaritic sheetof finest texture, under the elaborately carved and sumptuously giltcanopy, the silken curtains, and the tassels of the purest dust ofgold."_Barnstaple_.  Tassels of dust of gold! only figuratively, I suppose._Ansard_.  Nothing more.  "Each particular straw of this dank, damp bedwas elastic with delight, at bearing such angelic pressure; and, as ourheroine cast her ineffably beaming eyes about the dark void, lighting upwith their effulgent rays each little portion of the dungeon, as sheglanced them from one part to another, she perceived that the manyreptiles enclosed with her in this narrow tomb, were nestling to herside, their eyes fixed upon her in mute expressions of love andadmiration.  Her eclipsed orbs were each, for a moment, suffused with abright and heavenly tear, and from the suffusion threw out a morebrilliant light upon the feeling reptiles who paid this tribute to herundeserved sufferings.  She put forth her beauteous hand, whose `fainttracery'--(I stole that from Cooper)--whose faint tracery had so oftengiven to others the idea that it was ethereal, and not corporeal, andlifting with all the soft and tender handling of first love a venerabletoad, which smiled upon her, she placed the interesting animal so thatit could crawl up and nestle in her bosom, `Poor child of dank, ofdarkness, and of dripping,' exclaimed she, in her flute-like notes, `whosheltereth thyself under the wet and mouldering wall, so neglected inthy form by thy mother Nature, repose awhile in peace where princes andnobles would envy thee, if they knew thy present lot.  But that shallnever be; these lips shall never breathe a tale which might endanger thyexistence; fear not, therefore, their enmity, and as thou slowlycreepest away thy little round of circumscribed existence, forget menot, but shed an occasional pearly tear to the memory of the persecuted,the innocent Angelicanarinella!'"  What d'ye think of that?_Barnstaple_.  Umph! a very warm picture certainly; however, it isnatural.  You know, a person of her consequence could never existwithout a little _toadyism_._Ansard_.  I have a good many subterraneous soliloquies, which wouldhave been lost for ever, if I did not bring them up._Barnstaple_.  That one you have just read is enough to make everybodyelse bring up._Ansard_.  I rather plume myself upon it._Barnstaple_.  Yes, it is a feather in your cap, and will act as afeather in the throat of your readers._Ansard_.  Now I'll turn over the second volume, and read you another_morceau_, in which I assume the more playful vein.  I have imitated oneof our modern writers, who must be correct in her language, as she knowsall about heroes and heroines.  I must confess that I've cribbed alittle._Barnstaple_.  Let's hear._Ansard_.  "The lovely Angelicanarinella _pottered_ for some time aboutthis fairy chamber, then `wrote journal.'  At last, she _threw herselfdown on the floor_, pulled out the miniature, _gulped_ when she lookedat it, and then _cried herself to sleep_."_Barnstaple_.  _Pottered_ and _gulped_!  What language do you call that?_Ansard_.  It's all right, my dear fellow.  I understand that it is therefined slang of the modern boudoir, and only known to the initiated._Barnstaple_.  They had better keep it entirely to their boudoirs.  Ishould advise you to leave it all out._Ansard_.  Well, I thought that one who was so very particular, musthave been the standard of perfection herself._Barnstaple_.  That does not at all follow._Ansard_.  But what I wish to read to you is the way in which I havemanaged that my secret shall never be divulged.  It is known only tofour._Barnstaple_.  A secret known to four people!  You must be quick then._Ansard_.  So I am, as you shall hear; they all meet in a dark gallery,but do not expect to meet any one but the hero, whom they intend tomurder, each one having, unknown to the others, made an appointment withhim for that purpose, on the pretence of telling him the great secret.Altogether the scene is well described, but it is long, so I'll come atonce to the _denouement_._Barnstaple_.  Pray do._Ansard_.  "Absenpresentini felt his way by the slimy wall, when thebreath of another human being caught his ear: he paused, and held hisown breath.  `No, no,' muttered the other, `the _secret of blood andgold_ shall remain with me alone.  Let him come, and he shall finddeath.'  In a second, the dagger of Absenpresentini was in themutterer's bosom:--he fell without a groan.  `To me alone the secret ofblood and gold, and with me it remains,' exclaimed Absenpresentini.  `Itdoes remain with you,' cried Phosphorini, driving his dagger into hisback:--Absenpresentini fell without a groan, and Phosphorini,withdrawing his dagger, exclaimed, `Who is now to tell the secret butme?'  `Not you,' cried Vortiskini, raising up his sword and striking atwhere the voice proceeded.  The trusty steel cleft the head of theabandoned Phosphorini, who fell without a groan.  `Now will I retain thesecret of blood and gold,' said Vortiskini, as he sheathed his sword.`Thou shalt,' exclaimed the wily Jesuit, as he struck his stiletto tothe heart of the robber, who fell without a groan.  `With me only doesthe secret now rest, by which our order might be disgraced; with me itdies,' and the Jesuit raised his hand.  `Thus to the glory and thehonour of his society does Manfredini sacrifice his life.'  He struckthe keen-pointed instrument into his heart, and died without a groan.`Stop,' cried our hero."_Barnstaple_.  And I agree with your hero: stop, Ansard, or you'll killme too--but not without a groan._Ansard_.  Don't you think it would act well?_Barnstaple_.  Quite as well as it reads; pray is it all like this?_Ansard_.  You shall judge for yourself.  I have half killed myself withwriting it, for I chew opium every night to obtain ideas.  Now again--_Barnstaple_.  Spare me, Ansard, spare me; my nerves are ratherdelicate; for the remainder I will take your word._Ansard_.  I wish my duns would do the same, even if it were only mywasherwoman; but there's no more tick for me here, except this old watchof my father's, which serves to remind me of what I cannot obtain fromothers--time; but, however, there is a time for all things, and when thetime comes that my romance is ready, my creditors will obtain the_ready_._Barnstaple_.  Your only excuse, Ansard._Ansard_.  I beg your pardon.  The public require strong writingnow-a-days.  We have thousands who write well, and the public arenauseated with what is called _good writing_._Barnstaple_.  And so they want something bad, eh?  Well, Ansard, youcertainly can supply them._Ansard_.  My dear Barnstaple, you must not disparage this style ofwriting--it is not bad--there is a great art in it.  It may be termedwriting intellectual and ethereal.  You observe, that it never allowsprobabilities or even possibilities to stand in its way.  The dross ofhumanity is rejected: all the common wants and grosser feelings of ournatures are disallowed.  It is a novel which is all mind and passion.Corporeal attributes and necessities are thrown on one side, as theywould destroy the charm of perfectability.  Nothing can soil, or defile,or destroy my heroine; suffering adds lustre to her beauty, as pure goldis tried by fire: nothing can kill her, because she is all mind.  As formy men, you will observe when you read my work--_Barnstaple_.  When I do!_Ansard_.  Which, of course, you will--that they also have theirappetites in abeyance; they never want to eat, or drink, or sleep--arealways at hand when required, without regard to time or space.  Nowthere is a great beauty in this description of writing.  The women adoreit because they find their sex divested of those human necessities,without which they would indeed be angels! the mirror is held up tothem, and they find themselves perfect--no wonder they are pleased.  Theother sex are also very glad to dwell upon female perfectability, whichthey can only find in a romance, although they have often dreamt of itin their younger days._Barnstaple_.  There is some truth in these remarks.  Every milliner'sgirl, who devours your pages in bed by the half-hour's light of tallowstolen for the purpose, imagines a strong similarity between herself andyour Angelicanarinella, and every shop-boy measuring tape or weighingyellow soap will find out attributes common to himself and to your hero._Ansard_.  Exactly.  As long as you draw perfection in both sexes, youare certain to be read, because by so doing you flatter human nature andself-love, and transfer it to the individual who reads.  Now a pictureof real life--_Barnstaple_.  Is like some of Wouvermans' best pictures, which will notbe purchased by many, because his dogs in the foreground are doingexactly what all dogs will naturally do when they first are let out oftheir kennels._Ansard_.  Wouvermans should have known better, and made his dogs bettermannered if he expected his pictures to be hung up in the parlour ofrefinement._Barnstaple_ Very true._Ansard_.  Perhaps you would like to have another passage or two._Barnstaple_.  Excuse me: I will imagine it all.  I only hope, Ansard,this employment will not interfere with your legal practice._Ansard_.  My dear Barnstaple, it certainly will not, because my legalpractice cannot be interfered with.  I have been called to the bar, butfind no employment in my calling.  I have been sitting in my gown andwig for one year, and may probably sit a dozen more before I have torise to address their lordships.  I have not yet had a guinea brief.  Myonly chance is to be sent out as judge to Sierra Leone, or perhaps to bemade a commissioner of the Court of Requests._Barnstaple_.  You are indeed humble in your aspirations.  I recollectthe time, Ansard, when you dreamt of golden fame, and aspired to thewoolsack--when your ambition prompted you to midnight labour, and youshowed an energy--_Ansard_.  (_putting his hands up to his forehead, with his elbows onthe table_.)  What can I do, Barnstaple?  If I trust to briefs, myexistence will be but brief--we all must live._Barnstaple_.  I will not reply as Richelieu did to a brother author,"Je ne vois pas la necessite;" but this I do say, that if you are infuture to live by supplying the public with such nonsense, the shorteryour existence the better.CHAPTER FIFTY.THE LEGEND OF THE BELL ROCK.There was a grand procession through the streets of the two towns ofPerth and Dundee.  The holy abbots, in their robes, walked under gildedcanopies, the monks chanted, the censers were thrown, flags and bannerswere carried by seamen, lighted tapers by penitents; Saint Antonio, thepatron of those who trust to the stormy ocean, was carried in all pompthrough the streets; and, as the procession passed, coins of variousvalue were thrown down by those who watched it from the windows, and, asfast as thrown were collected by little boys dressed as angels, andholding silver vessels to receive the largesses.  During the whole daydid the procession continue, and large was the treasure collected in thetwo towns.  Every one gave freely, for there were few, indeed none, who,if not in their own circle, at least among their acquaintances, had todeplore the loss of some one dear to them, or to those they visited,from the dangerous rock which lay in the very track of all the vesselsentering the Firth of Tay.These processions had been arranged, that a sufficient sum of moneymight be collected to enable them to put in execution a plan proposed byan adventurous and bold young seaman, in a council held for the purpose,of fixing a bell on the rock, which could be so arranged that theslightest breath of wind would cause the hammer of it to sound, andthus, by its tolling, warn the mariner of his danger; and the sums givenwere more than sufficient.  A meeting was then held, and it wasunanimously agreed that Andrew M'Clise should be charged with thecommission to go over to Amsterdam, and purchase the bell of a merchantresiding there, whom Andrew stated to have one in his possession, which,from its fine tone and size, was exactly calculated for the purport towhich it was to be appropriated.Andrew M'Clise embarked with the money, and made a prosperous voyage.He had often been at Amsterdam, and had lived with the merchant, whosename was Vandermaclin; and the attention to his affairs, the dexterityand the rapidity of the movements of Andrew M'Clise, had often elicitedthe warmest encomiums of Mynheer Vandermaclin; and many evenings hadAndrew M'Clise passed with him, drinking in moderation their favouritescheedam, and indulging in the meditative merschaum.  Vandermaclin hadoften wished that he had a son like Andrew M'Clise, to whom he couldleave his property, with the full assurance that the heap would not bescattered, but greatly added to.Vandermaclin was a widower.  He had but one daughter, who was now justarrived at an age to return from the pension to her father's house, andtake upon herself the domestic duties.  M'Clise had never yet seen thebeautiful Katerina."And so, Mynheer M'Clise," said Vandermaclin, who was sitting in thewarehouse on the ground-floor of his tenement, "you come to purchase thefamous bell of Utrecht; with the intention of fixing it upon that rock,the danger of which we have so often talked over after the work of theday has been done?  I, too, have suffered from that same rock, as youwell know; but still I have been fortunate.  The price will be heavy;and so it ought to be, for the bell itself is of no small weight.""We are prepared to pay it, Mynheer Vandermaclin.""Nevertheless, in so good a cause, and for so good a purport, you shallnot be overcharged.  I will say nothing of the beauty of theworkmanship, or even of the mere manufacture.  You shall pay but itsvalue in metal; the same price which the Jew Isaacs offered me for itbut four months ago.  I will not ask what a Jew would ask, but what aJew would give, which makes no small difference.  Have you ten thousandguilders?""I have, and more.""That is my price, Mynheer M'Clise, and I wish for no more; for I, too,will contribute my share to the good work.  Are you content, and is it abargain?""It is; and the holy abbots will thank you on vellum, MynheerVandermaclin, for your generosity.""I prefer the thanks of the bold seamen to those of the idle churchmen;but, never mind, it is a bargain.  Now, we will go in; it is time toclose the doors.  We will take our pipes, and you shall make theacquaintance of my fair daughter, Katerina."At the time we are speaking of, M'Clise was about six-and-twenty yearsof age; he was above the middle size, elegant in person, and with afrankness and almost nobility in his countenance, which won all who sawhim.His manners were like those of most seamen, bold, but not offensivelyso.  His eye was piercing as an eagle's; and it seemed as if his verysoul spoke from it.  At the very first meeting between him and thedaughter of Vandermaclin, it appeared to both as if their destinies wereto unite them.They loved not as others love, but with an intensity which it would beimpossible to portray; but they hardly exchanged a word.  Again andagain they met; their eyes spoke, but nothing more.  The bell was put onboard the vessel, the money had been paid down, and M'Clise could nolonger delay.  He felt as if his heart-strings were severed as he torehimself away from the land where all remained that he coveted uponearth.  And Katerina, she too felt as if her existence was a blank; andas the vessel sailed from the port, she breathed short; and when noteven her white and lofty topgallant sail could be discovered as a speck,she threw herself on her couch and wept.  And M'Clise as he sailed away,remained for hours leaning his cheek on his hand, thinking of, over andover again, every lineament and feature of the peerless Katerina.Two months passed away, during which M'Clise was busied every ebb of thetide in superintending the work on the rock.  At last, all was ready;and once more was to be beheld a gay procession; but this time it was onthe water.  It was on a calm and lovely summer's morn, that the abbotsand the monks, attended by a large company of the authorities, andothers, who were so much interested in the work in hand, started fromthe shore of Aberbrothwick in a long line of boats, decorated withsacred and with other various banners and devices.  The music floatedalong the water, and the solemn chants of the monks were for once heardwhere never yet they had been heard before, or ever will again.  M'Clisewas at the rock, in a small vessel purposely constructed to carry thebell, and with sheers to hang it on the supports imbedded in the solidrock.  The bell was in its place, and the abbot blessed the bell; andholy water was sprinkled on the metal, which was for the future to belashed by the waves of the salt sea.  And the music and the chants wererenewed; and as they continued, the wind gradually rose, and with therising of the wind the bell tolled loud and deep.  The tolling of thebell was the signal for return, for it was a warning that the weatherwas about to change, and the procession pulled back to Aberbrothwick,and landed in good time; for in one hour more, and the rocky coast wasagain lashed by the waves, and the bell tolled loud and quick, althoughthere were none there but the sea-gull, who screamed with fright as hewheeled in the air at this unusual noise upon the rock, which, at theebb he had so often made his resting-place.M'Clise had done his work; the bell was fixed; and once more he hastenedwith his vessel to Amsterdam.  Once more was he an inmate ofVandermaclin's house; once more in the presence of the idol of his soul.This time they spoke; this time their vows were exchanged for life anddeath.  But Vandermaclin saw not the state of their hearts.  He lookedupon the young seamen as too low, too poor, to be a match for hisdaughter; and as such an idea never entered his head, so did he neverimagine that he would have dared to love.  But he was soon undeceived;for M'Clise frankly stated his attachment, and demanded the hand ofKaterina; and, at the demand, Vandermaclin's face was flushed withanger."Mynheer M'Clise," said he, after a pause, as if to control hisfeelings; "when a man marries, he is bound to show that he haswherewithal to support his wife; to support her in that rank, and toafford her those luxuries to which she has been accustomed in herfather's house.  Show me that you can do so, and I will not refuse youthe hand of Katerina.""As yet, I have not," replied M'Clise; "but I am young and can work; Ihave money, and will gain more.  Tell me what sum do you think that Ishould possess to warrant my demanding the hand of your daughter?""Produce twelve thousand guilders, and she is yours," replied themerchant."I have but three thousand," replied M'Clise."Then, think no more of Katerina.  It is a foolish passion, and you mustforget it.  And, Mynheer M'Clise, I must not have my daughter'saffections tampered with.  She must forget you; and that can only beeffected by your not meeting again.  I wish you well, Mynheer M'Clise,but I must request your absence."M'Clise departed from the presence of the merchant, bowed down withgrief and disappointment.  He contrived that a letter, containing theresult of his application, should be put in the hands of Katerina.  ButVandermaclin was informed of this breach of observance, and Katerina wassent to a convent, there to remain until the departure of her lover; andVandermaclin wrote to his correspondent at Dundee, requesting that thegoods forwarded to him might not be sent by the vessel commanded byM'Clise.Of this our young captain received information.  All hope was nearlygone; still he lingered, and delayed his departure.  He was no longerthe active, energetic seaman; he neglected all, even his attire.M'Clise knew in which convent his fair Katerina had been immured; andoften would he walk round its precincts, with the hope of seeing her, ifit were but for a moment, but in vain.  His vessel was now laden, and hecould delay no longer.  He was to sail the next morning; and once moredid the unhappy young man take his usual walk to look at those wallswhich contained all that was dear to him on earth.  His reverie wasbroken by a stone falling down to his feet; he took it up; there was asmall piece of paper attached to it with a silken thread.  He opened it;it was the handwriting of Katerina, and contained but two words--"_TheBell_."The bell!  M'Clise started; for he immediately comprehended what wasmeant.  The whole plan came like electricity through his brain.  Yes;then there was a promise of happiness.  The bell was worth ten thousandguilders; that sum had been offered, and would now be given by Isaacsthe Jew.  He would be happy with his Katerina; and he blessed heringenuity for devising the means.  For a minute or two he wastransported; but the re-action soon took place.  What was he about toattempt? sacrilege--cruelty.  The bell had been blessed by the holychurch; it had been purchased by holy and devout alms.  It had beenplaced on the rock to save the lives of his brother seamen; and were heto remove it, would he not be responsible for all the lives lost?  Wouldnot the wail of the widow, and the tears of the orphan, be crying out toHeaven against him?  No, no! never!  The crime was too horrible; andM'Clise stamped upon the paper, thinking he was tempted by Satan in theshape of woman; but when woman tempts, man is lost.  He recalled thecharms of Katerina; all his repugnance was overcome; and he resolvedthat the deed should be accomplished, and that Katerina should begained, even if he lost his soul.Andrew M'Clise sailed away from Amsterdam, and Katerina recovered herliberty.  Vandermaclin was anxious that she should marry: and many werethe suitors for her hand, but in vain.  She reminded her father, that hehad pledged himself, if M'Clise counted down twelve thousand guilders,that she should be his wife; and to that pledge she insisted that he wasbound fast.  And Vandermaclin after reasoning with her, and pointing outto her that twelve thousand guilders was a sum so large, that M'Clisemight not procure until his old age, even if he were fortunate,acknowledged that such was his promise, and that he would, like anhonest man, abide by it, provided that M'Clise should fulfil his part ofthe agreement in the space of two years; after which he should delay hersettlement no longer.  And Katerina raised her eyes to heaven, andwhispered, as she clasped her hands, "The Bell."  Alas! that we shouldinvoke Heaven when we would wish to do wrong: but mortals are blind, andnone so blind as those who are impelled by passion.It was in the summer of that year that M'Clise had made hisarrangements: having procured the assistance of some lawless hands, hehad taken the advantage of a smooth and glassy sea and a high tide toremove the bell on board his own vessel; a work of little difficulty tohim, as he had placed it there, and knew well the fastenings.  He sailedaway for Amsterdam, and was permitted by Heaven to arrive safe with hissacrilegious freight.  He did not, as before, enter the canal oppositeto the house of Vandermaclin, but one that ran behind the habitation ofthe Jew Isaacs.  At night, he went into the house, and reported to theJew what he had for sale; and the keen grey eyes of the bent-doublelittle Israelite sparkled with delight, for he knew that his profitwould be great.  At midnight the bell was made fast to the crane, andsafely deposited in the warehouse of the Jew, who counted out the tenthousand guilders to the enraptured M'Clise, whose thoughts were whollyupon the possession of his Katerina, and not upon the crime he hadcommitted.But, alas! to conceal one crime, we are too often obliged to be guiltyof even deeper; and thus it was with Andrew M'Clise.  The people who hadassisted, upon the promise of a thousand guilders being divided amongthem, now murmured at their share, and insisted upon an equal divisionof the spoils, or threatened with an immediate confession of the blackdeed.M'Clise raved, and cursed, and tore his hair; promised to give them themoney as soon as he had wedded Katerina; but they would not consent.Again the devil came to his assistance, and whispered how he was to act:he consented.  The next night the division was to be made.  They met inhis cabin; he gave them wine, and they drank plentifully; but the winewas poisoned, and they all died before the morning.  M'Clise tiedweights to their bodies, and sunk them in the deep canal; broke open hishatches, to make it appear that his vessel had been plundered; and thenwent to the authorities denouncing his crew as having plundered him, andescaped.  Immediate search was made, but they were not to be found; andit was supposed that they had escaped in a boat.Once more M'Clise, whose conscience was seared, went to the house ofVandermaclin, counted down his twelve thousand guilders, and claimed hisbride; and Vandermaclin, who felt that his daughter's happiness was atstake, now gave his consent.  As M'Clise stated that he was anxious toreturn to England, and arrange with the merchants whose goods had beenplundered, in a few days the marriage took place; and Katerina claspedthe murderer in her arms.  All was apparent joy and revelry; but therewas anguish in the heart of M'Clise, who, now that he had gained hisobject, felt that it had cost him much too dear, for his peace of mindwas gone for ever.  But Katerina cared not; every spark of feeling wasabsorbed in her passion, and the very guilt of M'Clise but rendered himmore dear; for was it not for her that he had done all this?  M'Clisereceived her portion, and hasted to sail away; for the bodies were stillin the canal, and he trembled every hour lest his crime should bediscovered.  And Vandermaclin bade farewell to his daughter: and, heknew not why, but there was a feeling he could not suppress, that theynever should meet again."Down--down below, Katerina! this is no place for you," cried M'Clise,as he stood at the helm of the vessel.  "Down, dearest, down, or youwill be washed overboard.  Every sea threatens to pour into our decks;already have we lost two men.  Down, Katerina! down, I tell you.""I fear not; let me remain with you.""I tell you, down!" cried M'Clise, in wrath; and Katerina cast upon hima reproachful look, and obeyed.The storm was at its height; the sun had set, black and monstrousbillows chased each other, and the dismasted vessel was hurried ontowards the land.  The wind howled, and whistled sharply at each chinkin the bulwarks of the vessel.  For three days had they fought the gale,but in vain.  Now, if it continued, all chance was over; for the shorewas on their lee, distant not many miles.  Nothing could save them, butgaining the mouth of the Firth of Tay, and then they could bear up forDundee.  And there was a boiling surge, and a dark night, and roaringseas, and their masts were floating far away; and M'Clise stood at thehelm, keeping her broadside to the sea: his heart was full ofbitterness, and his guilty conscience bore him down, and he looked fordeath, and he dreaded it; for was he not a sacrilegious murderer, andwas there not an avenging God above?Once more Katerina appeared on deck, clinging for support to Andrew."I cannot stay below.  Tell me, will it soon be over?""Yes," replied M'Clise, gloomily; "it will soon be over with all of us.""How mean you? you told me there was no danger.""I told you falsely; there is death soon, and damnation afterwards; foryou I have lost my soul!""Oh! say not so.""I say it.  Leave me, leave me, woman, or I curse thee.""Curse me, Andrew?  Oh, no!  Kiss me, Andrew; and if we are to perish,let us expire in each other's arms.""'Tis as well; you have dragged me to perdition.  Leave me, I say, foryou have my bitter curse."Thus was his guilty love turned to hate, now that death was staring himin the face.Katerina made no reply.  She threw herself on the deck, and abandonedherself to her feeling of bitter anguish.  And as she lay there, andM'Clise stood at the helm, the wind abated; the vessel was no longerborne down as before, although the waves were still mountains high.  Theseamen on board rallied; some fragments of sail were set on the remnantsof the masts, and there was a chance of safety.  M'Clise spoke not, butwatched the helm.  The wind shifted in their favour; and hope rose inevery heart.  The Firth of Tay was now open, and they were saved!  Lightwas the heart of M'Clise when he kept away the vessel, and gave the helmup to the mate.  He hastened to Katerina, who still remained on thedeck, raised her up, whispered comfort and returning love; but she heardnot--she could not forget--and she wept bitterly."We are saved, dear Katerina!""Better that we had been lost!" replied she, mournfully."No, no! say not so, with your own Andrew pressing you to his bosom.""Your bitter curse!""'Twas madness--nothing--I knew not what I said."  But the iron hadentered into her soul.  Her heart was broken."You had better give orders for them to look out for the Bell Rock,"observed the man at the helm to M'Clise.The Bell Rock!  M'Clise shuddered, and made no reply.  Onward went thevessel, impelled by the sea and wind: one moment raised aloft, andtowering over the surge; at another, deep in the hollow trough, andwalled in by the convulsed element.  M'Clise still held his Katerina inhis arms, who responded not to his endearments, when a sudden shockthrew them on the deck.  The crashing of the timbers, the pouring of thewaves over the stern, the heeling and settling of the vessel, were butthe work of a few seconds.  One more furious shock,--she separates,falls on her beam ends, and the raging seas sweep over her.M'Clise threw from him her whom he had so madly loved, and plunged intothe wave.  Katerina shrieked, as she dashed after him, and all was over.When the storm rises, and the screaming sea-gull seeks the land, and thefisherman hasten his bark towards the beach, there is to be seen,descending from the dark clouds with the rapidity of lightning, the formof Andrew M'Clise, the heavy bell to which he is attached by the neck,bearing him down to his doom.And when all is smooth and calm, when at the ebbing tide, the wave butgently kisses the rock, then by the light of the silver moon, theoccupants of the vessels which sail from the Firth of Tay, have oftenbeheld the form of the beautiful Katerina, waving her white scarf as asignal that they should approach, and take her off from the rock onwhich she is seated.  At times, she offers a letter for her father,Vandermaclin; and she mourns and weeps as the wary mariners, with theireyes fixed on her, and with folded arms, pursue their course in silenceand in dread.CHAPTER FIFTY ONE.MOONSHINE.Those who have visited our West India possessions must have often beenamused with the humour and cunning which occasionally appear in a negromore endowed than the generality of his race, particularly when themaster also happens to be a humourist.  The swarthy servitor seems toreflect his patron's absurdities; and having thoroughly studied hischaracter, ascertains how far he can venture to take liberties withoutfear of punishment.One of these strange specimens I once met with in a negro calledMoonshine, belonging to a person equally strange in his own way, whohad, for many years, held the situation of harbour-master at Port Royal,but had then retired on a pension, and occupied a small house at Ryde,in the Isle of Wight.  His name was Cockle, but he had long beenaddressed as Captain Cockle; and this brevet rank he retained until theday of his death.  In person he was very large and fat--not unlike acockle in shape: so round were his proportions, and so unwieldy, that itappeared much easier to roll him along from one place to another, thanthat he should walk.  Indeed, locomotion was not to his taste: he seldomwent much farther than round the small patch of garden which was infront of his house, and in which he had some pinks and carnations andchrysanthemums, of which he was not a little proud.  His head was quitebald, smooth, and shining white; his face partook of a more roseatetint, increasing in depth till it settled into an intense red at the tipof his nose.  Cockle had formerly been a master of a merchant-vessel,and from his residence in a warm climate had contracted a habit ofpotation, which became confirmed during the long period of his holdinghis situation at Port Royal.  He had purchased Moonshine for threehundred dollars, when he was about seven years old, and, upon his returnto England, had taken him with him.Moonshine was very much attached to his master, very much attached tohaving his own way, and was, farther, very much attached to his master'sgrog bottle.The first attachment was a virtue: the second human nature; and thethird, in the opinion of old Cockle, a crime of serious magnitude.  Ivery often called upon Captain Cockle, for he had a quaint humour abouthim which amused; and, as he seldom went out, he was always glad to seeany of his friends.  Another reason was, that I seldom went to the housewithout finding some entertainment in the continual sparring between themaster and the man.  I was at that time employed in the PreventiveService, and my station was about four miles from the residence ofCockle.  One morning I stalked in, and found him, as usual, in hislittle parlour on the ground-floor."Well, Cockle, my boy, how are you?""Why, to tell you the truth, Bob, I'm all wrong.  I'm on the stool ofrepentance; to wit, on this easy chair, doing penance, as you perceive,in a pair of duck trousers.  Last night I was half-seas over, andtolerably happy; this morning I am high and dry, and intolerablymiserable.  Carried more sail than ballast last night, and lost my head;this morning I've found it again, with a pig of ballast in it, Ibelieve.  All owing to my good nature.""How is that, Cockle?""Why, that Jack Piper was here last night; and rather than he shoulddrink all the grog and not find his way home, I drank some myself--he'dbeen in a bad way if I had not, poor fellow!--and now, you see, I'msuffering all from good nature.  Easiness of disposition has been myruin, and has rounded me into this ball, by wearing away all my sharpedges, Bob.""It certainly was very considerate and very kind of you, Cockle,especially when we know how much you must have acted at variance withyour inclinations.""Yes, Bob, yes, I am the milk punch of human kindness.  I often cry--when the chimney smokes; and sometimes--when I laugh too much.  You see,I not only give my money, as others will do, but, as last night, I evengive my head to assist a fellow-creature.  I could, however, dispensewith it for an hour or two this morning.""Nay, don't say that; for although you might dispense with the upperpart, you could not well get on without your mouth, Cockle.""Very true, Bob; a chap without a mouth would be like a ship without acompanion hatch;--talking about that, the combings of my mouth arerather dry--what do you say, Bob, shall we call Moonshine?""Why it's rather broad daylight for Moonshine.""He's but an eclipse--a total eclipse, I may say.  The fact is, my headis so heavy, that it rolls about on my shoulders; and I must have astiffener down my throat to prop it it up.  So Moonshine, shine out, youblack-faced rascal!"The negro was outside, cleaning his knives:--he answered, but continuedat his work."How me shine, Massa Cockle, when you neber gib me _shiner_?""No: but I'll give you a _shinner_ on your lower limb, that shall makeyou feel planet-struck, if you don't show your ugly face," repliedCockle."Massa Cockle, you full of dictionary dis marning.""Come here, sir!""Why you so parsonal dis marning, sar," replied Moonshine, rubbing awayat the knifeboard--"my face no shine more dan your white skull widouthair.""I pulled one out, you scoundrel, every time you stole my grog, and nowthey are all gone.--Hairs; what should I do with heirs when I've nothingto leave," continued Cockle, addressing me--"hairs are like rats, thatquit a ship as soon as she gets old.  Now, Bob, I wonder how long thatrascal will make us wait.  I brought him home and gave him his freedom--but give an inch and he takes an ell.  Moonshine, I begin to feelangry--the tip of my nose is red already.""Come directly, Massa Cockle."Moonshine gave two more rubs on the board, and then made his appearance."You call me, sar?""What's the use of calling you, you black rascal?""Now sar, dat not fair--you say to me, Moonshine, always do one thingfirst--so I 'bey order and finish knives--dat ting done, I come and 'beynext order.""Well, bring some cold water and some tumblers."Moonshine soon appeared with the articles, and then walked out of theroom, grinning at me."Moonshine, where are you going, you thief?--when did you ever see medrink cold water, or offer it to my friend?""Neber see you drink it but once, and den you tipsy, and tink it gin;but you very often gib notin but water to your friends, Massa Cockle.""When, you scoundrel?""Why, very often you say dat water quite strong enough for me.""That's because I love you, Moonshine.  Grog is a sad enemy to us.""Massa Cockle real fine Christian--he lub him enemy," interruptedMoonshine, looking at me."At all events, I'm not ashamed to look mine enemy in the face--so handus out the bottle."Moonshine put the bottle on the table."Now, Bob," said Cockle, "what d'ye say to a _seven bell-er_?  Why,hallo! what's become of all the grog?""All drank last night, Massa Cockle," replied Moonshine."Now, you ebony thief, I'll swear that there was half a bottle left whenI took my last glass; for I held the bottle up to the candle toascertain the ullage.""When you go up tairs, Massa Cockle, so help me Gad! not one drop leftin de bottle.""Will you take your oath, Moonshine, that you did not drink any lastnight?""No, Massa Cockle, because I gentleman, and neber tell lie--me drink,because you gib it to me.""Then I must have been drunk indeed.  Now, tell me, how did I give it toyou?--tell me every word which passed.""Yes, Massa Cockle, me make you recollect all about it.  When MassaPiper go away, you look at bottel and den you say, `'Fore I go up tobed, I take one more glass for _coming_ up.'--Den I say, `'Pose you do,you nebber be able to _go up_.'  Den you say, `Moonshine, you goodfellow (you always call me good fellow when you want me), you must helpme.'  You drink you grog--you fall back in de chair, and you shut firstone eye, and den you shut de oder.  I see more grog on the table: so Itake up de bottel and I say, `Massa Cockle, you go up stairs?' and yousay, `Yes, yes--directly.'  Den I hold de bottel up and say to you,`Massa, shall I help you?' and you say, `Yes, you must _help_ me.'  Soden I take one glass of grog, 'cause you tell me to help you.""I didn't tell you to help yourself though, you scoundrel!""Yes, Massa, when you tell me to help you with de bottel, I 'bey order,and help myself.  Den, sar, I waits little more, and I say, `Massa nowyou go up 'tairs,' and you start up and you wake, and you say, `Yes,yes;' and den I hold up and show you bottel again, and I say, `Shall I_help_ you massa?' and den you say `Yes.'  So I 'bey order again, andtake one more glass.  Den you open mouth and you snore--so I look againand I see one little glass more in bottel, and I call you, `MassaCockle, Massa Cockle,' and you say, `high--high!'--and den you head fallon you chest, and you go sleep again--so den I call again and I say;`Massa Cockle, here one lilly more drop, shall I drink it?' and you nodyou head on you bosom, and say noting--so I not quite sure, and I sayagain, `Massa Cockle, shall I finish this lilly drop?' and you nod youhead once more.  Den I say, `all right,' and I say, `you very good helt,Massa Cockle;' and I finish de bottel.  Now, Massa, you ab de wholetory, and it all really for true."I perceived that Cockle was quite as much amused at this account ofMoonshine's as I was myself, but he put on a bluff look."So, sir, it appears that you took advantage of my helpless situation,to help yourself.""Massa Cockle, just now you tell Massa Farren dat you drink so much, allfor good nature Massa Piper--I do same all for good nature.""Well, Mr Moonshine, I must have some grog," replied Cockle, "and asyou helped yourself last night, now you must help me;--get it how youcan, I give you just ten minutes--""'Pose you give gib me ten shillings, sar," interrupted Moonshine, "datbetter.""Cash is all gone.  I havn't a skillick till quarter-day, not a shot inthe locker till Wednesday.  Either get me some more grog, or you'll getmore kicks than halfpence.""You no ab money--you no ab tick--how I get grog, Massa Cockle?  MissyO'Bottom, she tells me, last _quarter_ day, no pay _whole_ bill, she not_half_ like it; she say you great deceiver, and no trust more.""Confound the old hag!  Would you believe it, Bob, that Mrs Rowbottomhas wanted to grapple with me these last two years--wants to make melandlord of the Goose and Pepper-box, taking her as a fixture with thepremises.  I suspect I should be the goose and she the pepper-box;--butwe never could shape that course.  In the first place, there's too muchof her; and, in the next, there's too much of me.  I explained this tothe old lady as well as I could; and she swelled up as big as a balloon,saying, that, when people were really _attached_, they never _attached_any weight to such trifling obstacles.""But you must have been sweet upon her, Cockle?""Nothing more than a little sugar to take the nauseous taste of my longbill out of her mouth.  As for the love part of the story, that was allher own.  I never contradict a lady, because it's not polite; but sinceI explained, the old woman has huffed, and won't trust me with half aquartern--will she, Moonshine?""No, sar: when I try talk her over, and make promise, she say dat _allmoonshine_.  But, sar, I try 'gain--I tink I know how."  And Moonshinedisappeared, leaving us in the dark as to what his plans might be."I wonder you never did marry, Cockle," I observed."You would not wonder if you knew all.  I must say, that once, and onceonly, I was very near it.  And to whom do you think it was--a woman ofcolour.""A black woman?""No: not half black, only a quarter--what they call a quadroon in theWest Indies.  But, thank Heaven! she refused me.""Refused you? hang it, Cockle, I never thought that you had been refusedby a woman of colour.""I was, though.  You shall hear how it happened.  She had been thequadroon wife (you know what that means) of a planter of the name ofGuiness; he died, and not only bequeathed her her liberty, but also fourgood houses in Port Royal, and two dozen slaves.  He had been dead abouttwo years, and she was about thirty, when I first knew her.  She wasvery rich, for she had a good income and spent nothing, except in jewelsand dress to deck out her own person, which certainly was very handsome,even at that time, for she never had had any family.  Well, if I was notquite in love with her, I was with her houses and her money; and I usedto sit in her verandah and talk sentimental.  One day I made myproposal.  `Massa Cockle,' said she, `dere two ting I not like; one is,I not like your name.  'Pose I 'cept your offer, you must change youname.'"`Suppose you accept my offer, Mistress Guiness, you'll change yourname.  I don't know how I am to change mine,' I replied."`I make 'quiry, Massa Cockle, and I find that by act and parliament youget another name.'"`An act of parliament!'  I cried."`Yes, sar; and I pay five hundred gold Joe 'fore I hear people call meMissy Cockle--dat _shell_ fish,' said she, and she turned up her nose."`Humph!' said I, `and pray what is the next thing which you wish?'"`De oder ting, sar, is, you no ab _coat am arms_, no ab seal to yourwatch, with bird and beast 'pon 'em; now 'pose you promise me dat youtake oder name, and buy um coat am arms; den, sar, I take de matter into'sideration.'"`Save yourself the trouble, ma'am,' said I, jumping up; `my answer isshort--I'll see you and your whole generation hanged first!'"Well, that was a very odd sort of a wind-up to a proposal; but herecomes Moonshine."The black entered the room, and put a full bottle down on the table."Dare it is, sar," said he, grinning."Well, done, Moonshine, now I forgive you; but how did you manage it?""Me tell you all de tory, sar--first I see Missy O'Bottom, and I say,`How you do, how you find himsel dis marning?  Massa come, I tink, by anbye, but he almost fraid,' I said.  She say, `What he fraid for?'  Hetink you angry--not like see him--no lub him any more: he very sorry,very sick at 'art--he very much in lub wid you.""The devil you did!" roared Cockle; "now I shall be bothered again withthat old woman; I wish she was moored as a buoy to the Royal George.""Massa no hear all yet.  I say, `Miss O'Bottom, 'pose you no tell?'  `Itell.'--`Massa call for clean shirt dis morning, and I say, it no cleanshirt day, sar;' he say, `Bring me clean shirt;' and den he put him onclean shirt and he put him on clean duck trowsers, he make me brush himbest blue coat.  I say, `What all dis for, massa?'  He put him hand upto him head, and he fetch him breath and say--`I fraid Missy O'Bottom,no hear me now--I no hab courage;' and den he sit all dress ready, andno go.  Den he say, `Moonshine, gib me one glass grog, den I habcourage.'  I go fetch bottle, and all grog gone--not one lilly dropleft; den massa fall down plump in him big chair, and say, `I neber cango.'  `But,' say Missy O'Bottom, `why he no send for some?' `'Cause,' Isay, `quarter-day no come--money all gone.'--Den say she, `If you poormassa so _very_ bad, den I trust you one bottel--you gib my complimentsand say, I very appy to see him, and stay at home,'--Den I say, `MissyO'Bottom pose massa not come soon as he take one two glass grog cut myhead off.'  Dat all, sar.""That's all, is it?  A pretty scrape you have got me into, youscoundrel!  What's to be done now?""Why, let's have a glass of grog first, Cockle," replied I, "we've beenwaiting a long while for it, and we'll then talk the matter over.""Bob, you're sensible, and the old woman was no fool in sending theliquor--it requires _Dutch_ courage to attack such a Dutch-built oldschuyt; let's get the cobwebs out of our throats, and then we must seehow we can get out of this scrape.  I expect that I shall pay `dearlyfor my whistle' this time I wet mine.  Now, what's to be done, Bob?""I think that you had better leave it to Moonshine," said I."So I will.--Now, sir, as you have got me into this scrape, you must getme out of it.--D'ye hear?""Yes, Massa Cockle, I tink--but no ab courage.""I understand you, you sooty fellow--here, drink this, and see if itwill brighten up your wits.  He's a regular turnpike, that fellow, everything must pay toll.""Massa Cockle, I tell Missy O'Bottom dat you come soon as you hab twoglass grog; 'pose you only drink one.""That won't do, Moonshine, for I'm just mixing my second; you must findout something better.""One glass grog, massa, gib no more dan one tought--dat you ab--""Well, then, here's another.--Now recollect, before you drink it, youare to get me out of this scrape; if not, you get into a scrape, forI'll beat you as--as white as snow.""'Pose you no _wash_ nigger white, you no _mangle_ him white, MassaCockle," added Moonshine."The fellow's _ironing_ me, Bob, ar'n't he?" said Cockle, laughing."Now, before you drink, recollect the conditions.""Drink first, sar, make sure of dat," replied Moonshine, swallowing offthe brandy; "tink about it afterwards.--Eh!  I ab it," cried Moonshine,who disappeared, and Cockle and I continued in conversation over ourgrog, which to sailors is acceptable in any one hour in the twenty-four.About ten minutes afterwards Cockle perceived Moonshine in the littlefront garden.  "There's that fellow, Bob; what is he about?""Only picking a nosegay, I believe," replied I, looking out of thewindow."The rascal, he must be picking all my chrysanthemums.  Stop him, Bob."But Moonshine vaulted over the low pales, and there was no stopping him.It was nearly an hour before he returned; and when he came in, we foundthat he was dressed out in his best, looking quite a dandy, and withsome of his master's finest flowers, in a large nosegay, sticking in hiswaistcoat."All right, sar, all right; dat last glass grog gib me fine idee; youneber ab more trouble bout Missy O'Bottom.""Well, let's hear," said Cockle."I dress mysel bery 'pruce, as you see, massa.  I take nosegay.""Yes, I see that, and be hanged to you.""Neber mind, Massa Cockle.  I say to Missy O'Bottom, `Massa no ablecome, he very sorry, so he send me;' `well,' she say, `what you ab tosay, sit down, Moonshine, you very nice man.'  Den I say, `Massa Cocklelub you very much, he tink all day how he make you appy; den he say,Missy O'Bottom very fine 'oman, make very fine wife.'  Den MissyO'Bottom say, `'Top a moment,' and she bring a bottel from cupboard, andme drink something did make 'tomach feel really warm; and den she say,`Moonshine, what you massa say?' den I say, massa say, `You fine 'oman,make good wife;' but he shake um head, and say, `I very old man, no goodfor noting; I tink all day how I make her appy, and I find out--Moonshine, you young man, you 'andsome feller, you good servant, I notlike you go away, but I tink you make Missy O'Bottom very fine 'usband;so I not care for myself, you go to Missy O'Bottom, and tell I send you,dat I part wid you, and give you to her for 'usband.'"Cockle and I burst out laughing.  "Well, and what did Mrs Rowbottom sayto that?""She jump up, and try to catch me hair, but I bob my head, and she miss;den she say, `You filthy black rascal, you tell you massa, 'pose he evercome here, I break his white bald pate; and 'pose you ever come here, Ismash you woolly black skull.'--Dat all, Massa Cockle; you see all rightnow, and I quite dry wid talking.""All right! do you call it.  I never meant to quarrel with the oldwoman; what d'ye think, Bob--is it all right?""Why, you must either have quarrelled with her, or married her, that'sclear.""Well, then, I'm clear of her, and so it's all right.  It a'n't everyman who can get out of matrimony by sacrificing a nosegay and twoglasses of grog.""Tree glasses, Massa Cockle," said Moonshine."Well, three glasses; here it is, you dog, and its dog cheap, too.Thank God, next Wednesday's quarter day.  Bob, you must dine with me--cut the service for to-day.""With all my heart," replied I, "and I'll salve my conscience by walkingthe beach all night; but, Cockle, look here, there is but a drop in thebottle, and you have no more.  I am like you, with a clean swept hold.You acknowledge the difficulty?""It stares me in the face, Bob; what must be done?""I'll tell you--in the first place, what have you for dinner?""Moonshine, what have we got for dinner?""Dinner, sar?--me not yet tink about dinner.  What you like to eat,sar?""What have we got in the house, Moonshine?""Let me see, sar? first place, we ab very fine piece picklum pork; denwe have picklum pork; and den--let me tink--den we ab, we ab picklumpork, sar.""The long and the short of it is, Bob, that we have nothing but a pieceof pickled pork; can you dine off that?""Can a duck swim, Cockle!""Please, sar, we ab plenty pea for _dog baddy_," said Moonshine."Well, then, Cockle, as all that is required is to put the pot on thefire, you can probably spare Moonshine, after he has done that, and wewill look to the cookery; start him off with a note to Mr Johns, and hecan bring back a couple of bottles from my quarters.""Really dat very fine tought, Massa Farren; I put in pork, and den I goand come back in one hour.""That you never will, Mr Moonshine; what's o'clock now? mercy on us,how time flies in your company, Cockle, it is nearly four o'clock; itwill be dark at six.""Neber mind, sar, me always ab _moonshine_ whereber I go," said theblack, showing his teeth."It will take two hours to boil the pork, Bob; that fellow has been sobusy this morning that he has quite forgot the dinner.""All you business, Massa Cockle.""Very true; but now start as soon as you can, and come back as soon asyou can; here's the note."Moonshine took the note, looked at the direction, as if he could readit, and in a few minutes was seen to depart."And now, Cockle," said I, "as Moonshine will be gone some time, supposeyou spin us a yarn to pass away the time.""I'll tell you what, Bob, I am not quite so good at that as I used tobe.  I've an idea that when my pate became bald, my memory oozed away byinsensible perspiration.""Never mind, you must have something left, you can't be quite empty.""No, but my tumbler is; so I'll just fill that up, and then I'll tellyou how it was that I came to go to sea.""The very thing that I should like to hear, above all others.""Well, then, you must know that, like cockles in general, I was born onthe sea-shore, just a quarter of a mile out of Dover, towardsShakespeare's Cliff.  My father was a fisherman by profession, and asmuggler by practice, all was fish that came to his net; but his cottagewas small, he was supposed to be very poor, and a very bad fisherman,for he seldom brought home many; but there was a reason for that, hevery seldom put his nets overboard.  His chief business lay in takingout of vessels coming down Channel, goods which were shipped and bondedfor exportation, and running them on shore again.  You know, Bob, thatthere are many articles which are not permitted to enter even uponpaying duty, and when these goods, such as silks, etcetera, are seizedor taken in prizes, they are sold for exportation.  Now, it was then thecustom for vessels to take them on board in the river, and run them onshore as they went down Channel, and the fishing-boats were usuallyemployed for this service; my father was a well-known hand for this kindof work, for not being suspected, he was always fortunate; of course,had he once been caught, they would have had their eyes upon him afterhe had suffered his punishment.  Now the way my father used to managewas this: there was a long tunnel-drain from some houses used asmanufactories, about a hundred yards above his cottage, which extendedout into the sea at low-water mark, and which passed on one side of ourcottage.  My father had cut from a cellar in the cottage into the drain,and as it was large enough for a man to kneel down in, he used to comein at low-water with his coble, and make fast the goods, properlysecured from the wet and dirt in tarpaulin bags, to a rope, which ledfrom the cellar to the sea through the drain.  When the water had flowedsufficiently to cover the mouth of the drain, he then threw the bagsoverboard, and, securing the boat, went to the cottage, hauled up thearticles, and secured them too; d'ye understand?  My father had no oneto assist him but my brother, who was a stout fellow, seven years olderthan myself, and my mother, who used to give a helping hand whenrequired; and thus did he keep his own counsel, and grow rich; when allwas right, he got his boat over into the harbour, and having securedher, he came home as innocent as a lamb.  I was then about eight or nineyears old, and went with my father and brother in the coble, for sherequired three hands, at least, to manage her properly, and like atin-pot, although not very big, I was very useful.  Now it so happenedthat my father had notice that a brig, laying in Dover harbour, wouldsail the next day, and that she had on board of her a quantity of laceand silks, purchased at the Dover custom-house for exportation, which hewas to put on shore again to be sent up to London.  The sending up toLondon we had nothing to do with; the agent at Dover managed all that;we only left the articles at his house, and then received the money onthe nail.  We went to the harbour, where we found the brig hauling out,so we made all haste to get away before her.  It blew fresh from thenorthward and eastward, and there was a good deal of sea running.  As wewere shoving out, the London agent, a jolly little round-faced fellow,in black clothes, and a bald white head, called to us, and said that hewanted to board a vessel in the offing, and asked whether we would takehim.  This was all a ruse, as he intended to go on board of the brigwith us to settle matters, and then return in the pilot boat.  Well, wehoisted our jib, drew aft our foresheet, and were soon clear of theharbour; but we found that there was a devil of a sea running, and morewind than we bargained for; the brig came out of the harbour with aflowing sheet, and we lowered down the foresail to reef it--father andbrother busy about that, while I stood at the helm, when the agent saidto me, `When do you mean to make a voyage?'  `Sooner than father thinksfor,' said I, `for I want to see the world.'  It was sooner than I_thought for_ too, as you shall hear.  As soon as the brig was well out,we ran down to her, and with some difficulty my father and the agent goton board, for the sea was high and cross, the tide setting against thewind; my brother and I were left in the boat to follow in the wake ofthe brig; but as my brother was casting off the rope forward, his legcaught in the bight, and into the sea he went; however, they hauled himon board, leaving me alone in the coble.  It was not of muchconsequence, as I could manage to follow before the wind under easysail, without assistance: so I kept her in the wake of the brig, both ofus running nearly before it at the rate of five miles an hour, waitingtill my father should have made up his packages, of a proper size towalk through the tunnel drain."The Channel was full of ships, for the westerly winds had detained themfor a long time.  I had followed the brig about an hour, when the agentwent on shore in a pilot boat, and I expected my father would soon beready; then the wind veered more towards the southward, with dirt: atlast it came on foggy, and I could hardly see the brig, and as it rainedhard, and blew harder, I wished that my father was ready, for my armsached with steering the coble for so long a while.  I could not leavethe helm, so I steered on at a black lump, as the brig looked throughthe fog: at last the fog was so thick that I could not see a yard beyondthe boat, and I hardly knew how to steer.  I began to be frightened,tired, and cold, and hungry I certainly was.  Well, I steered on formore than an hour, when the fog cleared up a little, and to my joy I sawthe stern of the brig just before me.  I expected that she wouldround-to immediately, and that my father would praise me for my conduct;and, what was still more to the purpose, that I should get something toeat and drink.  But no: she steered on right down Channel, and Ifollowed for more than an hour, when it came on to blow very hard, and Icould scarcely manage the boat--she pulled my little arms off.  Theweather now cleared up, and I could make out the vessel plainly; when Idiscovered that it was not the _brig_, but a bark which I had got holdof in the fog, so that I did not know what to do; but I did as most boyswould have done in a fright,--I sat down and cried; still, however,keeping the tiller in my hand, and steering as well as I could.  Atlast.  I could hold it no longer; I ran forward, let go the fore and jibhaul-yards, and hauled down the sails; drag them into the boat I couldnot, and there I was, like a young bear adrift in a washing-tub.  Ilooked around, and there were no vessels near; the bark had left me twomiles astern, it was blowing a gale from the SE, with a heavy sea--thegulls and sea-birds wheeling and screaming in the storm.  The boattossed and rolled about so that I was obliged to hold on, but sheshipped no water of any consequence, for the jib in the water forwardhad brought her head to wind, and acted as a sort of floating anchor.At last I lay down at the bottom of the boat and fell asleep.  It wasdaylight before I awoke, and it blew harder than ever; and I could justsee some vessels at a distance, scudding before the gale, but they couldhardly see me.  I sat very melancholy the whole day, shedding tears,surrounded by nothing but the roaring waves.  I prayed very earnestly: Isaid the Lord's Prayer, the Belief, and as much of the Catechism as Icould recollect.  I was wet, starving, and miserably cold.  At night Iagain fell asleep from exhaustion.  When morning broke, and the sunshone, the gale abated, and I felt more cheered; but I was now ravenousfrom hunger, as well as choking from thirst, and was so weak that Icould scarcely stand.  I looked round me every now and then, and in theafternoon saw a large vessel standing right for me; this gave me courageand strength.  I stood up and waved my hat, and they saw me--the sea wasstill running very high, but the wind had gone down.  She rounded-to soas to bring me under her lee.  Send a boat she could not, but the seabore her down upon me, and I was soon close to her.  Men in the chainswere ready with ropes, and I knew that this was my only chance.  Atlast, a very heavy sea bore her right down upon the boat, lurching overon her beam ends, her main chains struck the boat and sent her down,while I was seized by the scruff of the neck by two of the seamen, andborne aloft by them as the vessel returned to the weather-roll.  I wassafe.  And, as soon as they had given me something to eat, I told mystory.  It appeared that she was an East India-man running down Channel,and not likely to meet with anything to scud me back again.  Thepassengers, especially the ladies, were very kind to me: and as therewas no help for it, why, I took my first voyage to the _East Indies_.""And your father and your brother?""Why, when I met them, which I did about six years afterwards, I foundthat they had been in much the same predicament, having lost the coble,and the weather being so bad that they could not get on shore again.  Asthere was no help for it, they took their first voyage to the _WestIndies_; so there was a dispersion of an united family--two went west,one went east, coble went down, and mother, after waiting a month ortwo, and supposing father dead, went off with a soldier.  All dispersedby one confounded gale of wind from the northward and eastward, sothat's the way that I went to sea, Bob.  And now it's time thatMoonshine was back."But Moonshine kept us waiting for some time: when he returned it wasthen quite dark, and we had lighted candles, anxiously waiting for him;for not only was the bottle empty, but we were very hungry.  At last weheard a conversation at the gate, and Moonshine made his appearance withthe two bottles of spirits, and appeared himself to be also in highspirits.  The pork and peas-pudding soon were on the table.  We dinedheartily, and were sitting over the latter part of the first bottle inconversation, it being near upon the eleventh hour, when we heard anoise, at the gate--observed some figures of men, who stayed a shorttime and then disappeared.  The door opened, and Moonshine went out.  Ina few seconds he returned, bringing in his arms an anker of spirits,which he laid on the floor, grinning so wide that his head appeared halfoff.  Without saying a word, he left the room and returned with another."Why, what the devil's this?" cried Cockle.Moonshine made no answer, but went out and in until he had brought sixankers in, one after another, which he placed in a row on the floor.  Hethen shut the outside door, bolted it, came in, and seating himself onone of the tubs, laughed to an excess which compelled him to hold hissides; Cockle and I looking on in a state of astonishment."Where the devil did all this come from?" cried Cockle, getting out ofhis easy chair.  "Tell me, sir, or by--""I tell you all, Massa Cockle:--you find me better friend dan MissyO'Bottom.  Now you hab plenty, and neber need scold Moonshine 'pose hetake lilly drap.  I get all dis present to you, Massa Cockle."Feeling anxious, I pressed Moonshine to tell his story."I tell you all, sar.  When I come back wid de two bottle I meet plentymen wid de tubs: dey say, `Hollo there, who be you?'  I say, `I comefrom station: bring massa two bottel, and I show um.'  Den dey say,`Where you massa?' and I say, `At um house at Ryde'--(den dey tink datyou my massa, Massa Farren)--so dey say, `Yes, we know dat, we watch himdere, but now you tell, so we beat you dead.'  Den I say, `What for dat;massa like drink, why you no gib massa some tub, and den he neber saynoting, only make fuss some time, 'cause of Admirality.'  Den dey say,`You sure of dat?' and I say, `Quite sure massa neber say one word.'Den dey talk long while; last, dey come and say, `You come wid us andshow massa house.'  So two men come wid me, and when dey come to gate Isay, `Dis massa house when he live at Ryde, and dere you see massa;'--and I point to Massa Cockle, but dey see Massa Ferran--so dey say.  `Allvery good; tree, four hour more, you find six tub here; tell you massadat every time run tub, he alway hab six;' den dey go way, den dey comeback, leave tub; dat all, massa.""You rascal!" exclaimed I, rising up, "so you have compromised me; why Ishall lose my commission if found out.""No, sar; nobody wrong but de smuggler; dey make a lilly mistake; caseyou brought to court-martial, I give evidence, and den I clear you.""But what must we do with the tubs, Cockle?" said I, appealing to him."Do Bob?--why they are a present--a very welcome one, and a veryhandsome one into the bargain.  I shall not _keep_ them, I pledge you myword; let that satisfy you--they shall be _fairly entered_.""Upon that condition, Cockle," I replied, "I shall of course not giveinformation against you."  (I knew full well what he meant by saying hewould not _keep_ them.)"_How_ I do, Massa Cockle," said Moonshine, with a grave face; "I takeum to the Custom-house to-night or to-morrow morning.""To-morrow, Moonshine," replied Cockle; "at present just put them out ofsight."I did not think it prudent to make any further inquiries; but Iafterwards discovered that the smugglers, true to their word, and stillin error, continued to leave six tubs in old Cockle's garden wheneverthey succeeded in running a cargo, which, notwithstanding all ourendeavours, they constantly did.  One piece of information I gained fromthis affair, I found that the numbers of the cargoes which were runcompared to those which were seized during the remainder of the time Iwas on that station, was in the proportion of ten to one.  The cargoesrun were calculated by the observations of old Cockle, who, when Icalled upon him, used to say very quietly, "I shouldn't wonder if theydid not run a cargo last night, Bob, in spite of all your vigilance--wasit very dark?""On the contrary," replied I, looking at the demure face of the negro;"I suspect it was _Moonshine_."End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Olla Podrida, byFrederick Marryat (AKA Captain Marryat)*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OLLA PODRIDA ******** This file should be named 23139.txt or 23139.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/1/3/23139/Produced by Nick Hodson of London, EnglandUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

M. BARRIE1918CONTENTS  THE OLD LADY SHOWS HER MEDALS  THE NEW WORD  BARBARA'S WEDDING  A WELL-REMEMBERED VOICETHE OLD LADY SHOWS HER MEDALSThree nice old ladies and a criminal, who is even nicer, are discussingthe war over a cup of tea. The criminal, who is the hostess, calls it adish of tea, which shows that she comes from Caledonia; but that is nother crime.They are all London charwomen, but three of them, including the hostess,are what are called professionally 'charwomen _and_' or simply'ands.' An 'and' is also a caretaker when required; her name is enteredas such in ink in a registry book, financial transactions take placeacross a counter between her and the registrar, and altogether she is ofa very different social status from one who, like Mrs. Haggerty, is acharwoman but nothing else. Mrs. Haggerty, though present, is not at theparty by invitation; having seen Mrs. Dowey buying the winkles, shefollowed her downstairs, so has shuffled into the play and sat down init against our wish. We would remove her by force, or at least print hername in small letters, were it not that she takes offence very readilyand says that nobody respects her. So, as you have slipped in, you sitthere, Mrs. Haggerty; but keep quiet.There is nothing doing at present in the caretaking way for Mrs. Dowey,our hostess; but this does not damp her, caretaking being only to suchas she an extra financially and a halo socially. If she had the honourof being served with an income-tax paper she would probably fill in oneof the nasty little compartments with the words, 'Trade--charring;Profession (if any)--caretaking.' This home of hers (from which, to lookafter your house, she makes occasionally temporary departures in greatstyle, escorting a barrow) is in one of those what-care-I streets thatyou discover only when you have lost your way; on discovering them, yourduty is to report them to the authorities, who immediately add them tothe map of London. That is why we are now reporting Friday Street. Weshall call it, in the rough sketch drawn for to-morrow's press, 'Streetin which the criminal resided'; and you will find Mrs. Dowey's hometherein marked with a X.Her abode really consists of one room, but she maintains that there aretwo; so, rather than argue, let us say that there are two. The other onehas no window, and she could not swish her old skirts in it withoutknocking something over; its grandest display is of tin pans andcrockery on top of a dresser which has a lid to it; you have but to whipoff the utensils and raise the lid, and, behold, a bath with hot andcold. Mrs. Dowey is very proud of this possession, and when she shows itoff, as she does perhaps too frequently, she first signs to you withclosed fist (funny old thing that she is) to approach softly. She thentiptoes to the dresser and pops off the lid, as if to take the bathunawares. Then she sucks her lips, and is modest if you have the graceto do the exclamations.In the real room is a bed, though that is putting the matter toobriefly. The fair way to begin, if you love Mrs. Dowey, is to say to herthat it is a pity she has no bed. If she is in her best form she willchuckle, and agree that the want of a bed tries her sore; she will keepyou on the hooks, so to speak, as long as she can; and then, with thatmouse-like movement again, she will suddenly spring the bed on you. Youthought it was a wardrobe, but she brings it down from the wall; and lo,a bed. There is nothing else in her abode (which we now see to containfour rooms--kitchen, pantry, bedroom, and bathroom) that is absolutelya surprise; but it is full of 'bits,' every one of which has been paidready money for, and gloated over and tended until it has become part ofits owner. Genuine Doweys, the dealers might call them, though there isprobably nothing in the place except the bed that would fetchhalf-a-crown.Her home is in the basement, so that the view is restricted to the lowerhalf of persons passing overhead beyond the area stairs. Here at thewindow Mrs. Dowey sometimes sits of a summer evening gazing, notsentimentally at a flower-pot which contains one poor bulb, noryearningly at some tiny speck of sky, but with unholy relish at holes instockings, and the like, which are revealed to her from her point ofvantage. You, gentle reader, may flaunt by, thinking that your fineryawes the street, but Mrs. Dowey can tell (and does) that your soles arein need of neat repair.Also, lower parts being as expressive as the face to those whose view isthus limited, she could swear to scores of the passers-by in a court oflaw.These four lively old codgers are having a good time at the tea-table,and wit is flowing free. As you can see by their everyday garments, andby their pails and mops (which are having a little tea-party bythemselves in the corner), it is not a gathering by invitationsstretching away into yesterday, it is a purely informal affair; so muchmore attractive, don't you think? than banquets elaborately prearranged.You know how they come about, especially in war-time. Very likely Mrs.Dowey met Mrs. Twymley and Mrs. Mickleham quite casually in the street,and meant to do no more than the time of day; then, naturally enough,the word camouflage was mentioned, and they got heated, but in the endMrs. Twymley apologised; then, in the odd way in which one thing leadsto another, the winkle man appeared, and Mrs. Dowey remembered that shehad that pot of jam and that Mrs. Mickleham had stood treat last time;and soon they were all three descending the area stairs, followedcringingly by the Haggerty Woman.They have been extremely merry, and never were four hard-worked oldladies who deserved it better. All a woman can do in war-time they dodaily and cheerfully. Just as their men-folk are doing it at the Front;and now, with the mops and pails laid aside, they sprawl gracefully atease. There is no intention on their part to consider peace terms untila decisive victory has been gained in the field (Sarah Ann Dowey), untilthe Kaiser is put to the right-about (Emma Mickleham), and singing verysmall (Amelia Twymley).At this tea-party the lady who is to play the part of Mrs. Dowey is sureto want to suggest that our heroine has a secret sorrow, namely, thecrime; but you should see us knocking that idea out of her head! Mrs.Dowey knows she is a criminal, but, unlike the actress, she does notknow that she is about to be found out; and she is, to put it bluntly inher own Scotch way, the merriest of the whole clanjamfry. She pressesmore tea on her guests, but they wave her away from them in the prettymanner of ladies who know that they have already had more than enough.MRS. DOWEY. 'Just one more winkle, Mrs. Mickleham?' Indeed there is onlyone more.But Mrs. Mickleham indicates politely that if she took this one it wouldhave to swim for it. (The Haggerty Woman takes it long afterwards whenshe thinks, erroneously, that no one is looking.)Mrs. Twymley is sulking. Evidently some one has contradicted her.Probably the Haggerty Woman.MRS. TWYMLEY. 'I say it is so.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'I say it may be so.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'I suppose I ought to know: me that has a son a prisonerin Germany.' She has so obviously scored that all good feeling seems tocall upon her to end here. But she continues rather shabbily, 'Being theonly lady present that has that proud misfortune.' The others are stung.MRS. DOWEY. 'My son is fighting in France.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Mine is wounded in two places.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Mine is at Salonaiky.'The absurd pronunciation of this uneducated person moves the others tomirth.MRS. DOWEY. 'You'll excuse us, Mrs. Haggerty, but the correctpronunciation is Salonikky.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN, to cover her confusion. 'I don't think.' She feelsthat even this does not prove her case. 'And I speak as one that has WarSavings Certificates.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'We all have them.'The Haggerty Woman whimpers, and the other guests regard her withunfeeling disdain.MRS. DOWEY, to restore cheerfulness, 'Oh, it's a terrible war.'ALL, brightening, 'It is. You may say so.'MRS. DOWEY, encouraged, 'What I say is, the men is splendid, but I'mnone so easy about the staff. That's your weak point, Mrs. Mickleham.'MRS. MICKLEHAM, on the defence, but determined to reveal nothing thatmight be of use to the enemy, 'You may take it from me, the staff's allright.'MRS. DOWEY. 'And very relieved I am to hear you say it.'It is here that the Haggerty Woman has the remaining winkle.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'You don't understand properly about trench warfare. IfI had a map----'MRS. DOWEY, wetting her finger to draw lines on the table. 'That's theriver Sommy. Now, if we had barrages here----'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Very soon you would be enfilided. Where's your supports,my lady?' Mrs. Dowey is damped.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'What none of you grasps is that this is a artillerywar----'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN, strengthened by the winkle, 'I say that the word isSalonaiky.'The others purse their lips.MRS. TWYMLEY, with terrible meaning, 'We'll change the subject. Have youseen this week's _Fashion Chat_?' She has evidently seen anddevoured it herself, and even licked up the crumbs. 'The gabardine withaccordion pleats has quite gone out.'MRS. DOWEY, her old face sparkling. 'My sakes! You tell me?'MRS. TWYMLEY, with the touch of haughtiness that comes of great topics,'The plain smock has come in again, with silk lacing, giving thatcharming chic effect.'MRS. DOWEY. 'Oho!'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I must say I was always partial to the straightline'--thoughtfully regarding the want of line in Mrs. Twymley'sperson--'though trying to them as is of too friendly a figure.'It is here that the Haggerty Woman's fingers close unostentatiously upona piece of sugar.MRS. TWYMLEY, sailing into the Empyrean, 'Lady Dolly Kanister was seenconversing across the railings in a dainty _de jou_.'MRS. DOWEY. 'Fine would I have liked to see her.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'She is equally popular as maid, wife, andmunition-worker. Her two children is inset. Lady Pops Babington wasmarried in a tight tulle.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'What was her going-away dress?'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'A champagny cream velvet with dreamy corsage. She'smarried to Colonel the Hon. Chingford--"Snubs," they called him atEton.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN, having disposed of the sugar, 'Very likely he'll besent to Salonaiky.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Wherever he is sent, she'll have the same tremors asthe rest of us. She'll be as keen to get the letters wrote with pencilsas you or me.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Them pencil letters!'MRS. DOWEY, in her sweet Scotch voice, timidly, afraid she may be goingtoo far, 'And women in enemy lands gets those pencil letters and thenstop getting them, the same as ourselves. Let's occasionally think ofthat.'She has gone too far. Chairs are pushed back.THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'I ask you!'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'That's hardly language, Mrs. Dowey.'MRS. DOWEY, scared, 'Kindly excuse. I swear to death I'm none of yourpacifists.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Freely granted.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'I've heard of females that have no male relations, and sothey have no man-party at the wars. I've heard of them, but I don't mixwith them.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'What can the likes of us have to say to them? It's nottheir war.'MRS. DOWEY, wistfully, 'They are to be pitied.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'But the place for them, Mrs. Dowey, is within doorswith the blinds down.'MRS. DOWEY, hurriedly, 'That's the place for them.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I saw one of them to-day buying a flag. I thought itwas very impudent of her.'MRS. DOWEY, meekly, 'So it was.'MRS. MICKLEHAM, trying to look modest with indifferent success, 'I hada letter from my son, Percy, yesterday.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Alfred sent me his photo.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Letters from Salonaiky is less common.'Three bosoms heave, but not, alas, Mrs. Dowey's. Nevertheless shedoggedly knits her lips.MRS. DOWEY, the criminal, 'Kenneth writes to me every week.' There areexclamations. The dauntless old thing holds aloft a packet of letters.'Look at this. All his.'The Haggerty Woman whimpers.MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Alfred has little time for writing, being a bombardier.'MRS. DOWEY, relentlessly, 'Do your letters begin "Dear mother"?'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Generally.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Invariable.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Every time.'MRS. DOWEY, delivering the knock-out blow, 'Kenneth's begin "Dearestmother.'"No one can think of the right reply.MRS. TWYMLEY, doing her best, 'A short man, I should say, judging byyourself.'She ought to have left it alone.MRS. DOWEY. 'Six feet two-and a half.'The gloom deepens.MRS. MICKLEHAM, against her better judgment, 'A kilty, did you tell me?'MRS. DOWEY. 'Most certainly. He's in the famous Black Watch.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN, producing her handkerchief, 'The Surrey Rifles isthe famousest.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'There you and the King disagrees, Mrs. Haggerty. Hischoice is the Buffs, same as my Percy's.'MRS. TWYMLEY, magnanimously, 'Give me the R.H.A. and you can keep allthe rest.'MRS. DOWEY. 'I'm sure I have nothing to say against the Surreys and theR.H.A. and the Buffs; but they are just breeches regiments, Iunderstand.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'We can't all be kilties.'MRS. DOWEY, crushingly, 'That's very true.'MRS. TWYMLEY. It is foolish of her, but she can't help saying it. 'Hasyour Kenneth great hairy legs?'MRS. DOWEY. 'Tremendous.'The wicked woman: but let us also say 'Poor Sarah Ann Dowey.' For atthis moment, enter Nemesis. In other words, the less important part ofa clergyman appears upon the stair.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'It's the reverent gent!'MRS. DOWEY, little knowing what he is bringing her, 'I see he has hadhis boots heeled.'It may be said of Mr. Willings that his happy smile always walks infront of him. This smile makes music of his life, it means that onceagain he has been chosen, in his opinion, as the central figure inromance. No one can well have led a more drab existence, but he willnever know it; he will always think of himself, humbly though elatedly,as the chosen of the gods. Of him must it have been originally writtenthat adventures are for the adventurous. He meets them at every streetcorner. For instance, he assists an old lady off a bus, and asks her ifhe can be of any further help. She tells him that she wants to know theway to Maddox the butcher's. Then comes the kind, triumphant smile; italways comes first, followed by its explanation, 'I was thereyesterday!' This is the merest sample of the adventures that keep Mr.Willings up to the mark.Since the war broke out, his zest for life has become almost terrible.He can scarcely lift a newspaper and read of a hero without rememberingthat he knows some one of the name. The Soldiers' Rest he is connectedwith was once a china emporium, and (mark my words), he had bought histea service at it. Such is life when you are in the thick of it.Sometimes he feels that he is part of a gigantic spy drama. In thecourse of his extraordinary comings and goings he meets with GreatPersonages, of course, and is the confidential recipient of secret news.Before imparting the news he does not, as you might expect, first smileexpansively; on the contrary, there comes over his face an awfulsolemnity, which, however, means the same thing. When divulging thenames of the personages, he first looks around to make sure that nosuspicious character is about, and then, lowering his voice, tells you,'I had that from Mr. Farthing himself--he is the secretary of theBethnal Green Branch,--h'sh!'There is a commotion about finding a worthy chair for the reverent, andthere is also some furtive pulling down of sleeves, but he standssurveying the ladies through his triumphant smile. This amazing manknows that he is about to score again.MR. WILLINGS, waving aside the chairs, 'I thank you. But not at all.Friends, I have news.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'News?'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'From the Front?'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'My Alfred, sir?'They are all grown suddenly anxious--all except the hostess, who knowsthat there can never be any news from the Front for her.MR. WILLINGS. 'I tell you at once that all is well. The news is for Mrs.Dowey.'She stares.MRS. DOWEY. 'News for me?'MR. WILLINGS. 'Your son, Mrs. Dowey--he has got five days' leave.' Sheshakes her head slightly, or perhaps it only trembles a little on itsstem. 'Now, now, good news doesn't kill.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'We're glad, Mrs. Dowey.'MRS. DOWEY. 'You're sure?'MR. WILLINGS. 'Quite sure. He has arrived.'MRS. DOWEY. 'He is in London?'MR. WILLINGS. 'He is. I have spoken to him.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'You lucky woman.'They might see that she is not looking lucky, but experience has toldthem how differently these things take people.MR. WILLINGS, marvelling more and more as he unfolds his tale, 'Ladies,it is quite a romance, I was in the----' he looks around cautiously, buthe knows that they are all to be trusted--'in the Church Army quartersin Central Street, trying to get on the track of one or two of ourmissing men. Suddenly my eyes--I can't account for it--but suddenly myeyes alighted on a Highlander seated rather drearily on a bench, withhis kit at his feet.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'A big man?'MR. WILLINGS. 'A great brawny fellow.' The Haggerty Woman groans. '"Myfriend," I said at once, "welcome back to Blighty." I make a point ofcalling it Blighty. "I wonder," I said, "if there is anything I can dofor you?" He shook his head. "What regiment?" I asked.' Here Mr.Willings very properly lowers his voice to a whisper. '"Black Watch, 5thBattalion," he said. "Name?" I asked. "Dowey," he said.'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I declare. I do declare.'MR. WILLINGS, showing how the thing was done, with the help of a chair,'I put my hand on his shoulder as it might be thus. "Kenneth Dowey," Isaid, "I know your mother."'MRS. DOWEY, wetting her lips, 'What did he say to that?'MR. WILLINGS. 'He was incredulous. Indeed, he seemed to think I wasbalmy. But I offered to bring him straight to you. I told him how muchyou had talked to me about him.'MRS. DOWEY. 'Bring him here!'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I wonder he needed to be brought.'MR. WILLINGS. 'He had just arrived, and was bewildered by the greatcity. He listened to me in the taciturn Scotch way, and then he gavea curious laugh.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Laugh?'MR. WILLINGS, whose wild life has brought him into contact with thestrangest people, 'The Scotch, Mrs. Twymley, express their emotionsdifferently from us. With them tears signify a rollicking mood, whilemerriment denotes that they are plunged in gloom. When I had finished hesaid at once, "Let us go and see the old lady."'MRS. DOWEY, backing, which is the first movement she has made since hebegan his tale, 'Is he--coming?'MR. WILLINGS, gloriously, 'He has come. He is up there. I told him Ithought I had better break the joyful news to you.'Three women rush to the window. Mrs. Dowey looks at her pantry door, butperhaps she remembers that it does not lock on the inside. She standsrigid, though her face has gone very grey.MRS. DOWEY. 'Kindly get them to go away.'MR. WILLINGS. 'Ladies, I think this happy occasion scarcely requiresyou.' He is not the man to ask of woman a sacrifice that he is notprepared to make himself. 'I also am going instantly.' They all surveyMrs. Dowey, and understand--or think they understand.MRS. TWYMLEY, pail and mop in hand, 'I would thank none for theircompany if my Alfred was at the door.'MRS. MICKLEHAM, similarly burdened, 'The same from me. Shall I send himdown, Mrs. Dowey?' The old lady does not hear her. She is listening,terrified, for a step on the stairs. 'Look at the poor, joyous thing,sir. She has his letters in her hand.'The three women go. Mr. Willings puts a kind hand on Mrs. Dowey'sshoulder. He thinks he so thoroughly understands the situation.MR. WILLINGS. 'A good son, Mrs. Dowey, to have written to you so often.'Our old criminal quakes, but she grips the letters more tightly. PrivateDowey descends.'Dowey, my friend, there she is, waiting for you, with your letters inher hand.'DOWEY, grimly, 'That's great.'Mr. Willings ascends the stair without one backward glance, like thegood gentleman he is; and the Doweys are left together, with nearly thewhole room between them. He is a great rough chunk of Scotland, howkedout of her not so much neatly as liberally; and in his Black Watchuniform, all caked with mud, his kit and nearly all his worldlypossessions on his back, he is an apparition scarcely less fearsome (butso much less ragged) than those ancestors of his who trotted with PrinceCharlie to Derby. He stands silent, scowling at the old lady, daring herto raise her head; and she would like very much to do it, for she longsto have a first glimpse of her son. When he does speak, it is to jeer ather.'Do you recognise your loving son, missis?' ('Oh, the fine Scotch tangof him,' she thinks.) 'I'm pleased I wrote so often.' ('Oh, but he's_raized_,' she thinks.) He strides towards her, and seizes theletters roughly, 'Let's see them.'There is a string round the package, and he unties it, and examines theletters at his leisure with much curiosity. The envelopes are in order,all addressed in pencil to Mrs. Dowey, with the proud words 'Opened byCensor' on them. But the letter paper inside contains not a word ofwriting.'Nothing but blank paper! Is this your writing in pencil on theenvelope?' She nods, and he gives the matter further consideration.'The covey told me you were a charwoman; so I suppose you picked theenvelopes out of waste-paper baskets, or such like, and then changed theaddresses?' She nods again; still she dare not look up, but she isadmiring his legs. When, however, he would cast the letters into thefire, she flames up with sudden spirit. She clutches them.'Don't you burn them letters, mister.''They're not real letters.''They're all I have.'He returns to irony. 'I thought you had a son?''I never had a man nor a son nor anything. I just call myself Missis togive me a standing.''Well, it's past my seeing through.'He turns to look for some explanation from the walls. She gets a peep athim at last. Oh, what a grandly set-up man! Oh, the stride of him. Oh,the noble rage of him. Oh, Samson had been like this before that womantook him in hand.He whirls round on her. 'What made you do it?''It was everybody's war, mister, except mine.' She beats her arms.'I wanted it to be my war too.''You'll need to be plainer. And yet I'm d----d if I care to hear you,you lying old trickster.'The words are merely what were to be expected, and so are endurable; buthe has moved towards the door.'You're not going already, mister?''Yes, I just came to give you an ugly piece of my mind.'She holds out her arms longingly. 'You haven't gave it to me yet.''You have a cheek!'She gives further proof of it. 'You wouldn't drink some tea?''Me! I tell you I came here for the one purpose of blazing away at you.'It is such a roaring negative that it blows her into a chair. But she isup again in a moment, is this spirited old lady. 'You could drink thetea while you was blazing away. There's winkles.''Is there?' He turns interestedly towards the table, but his proud Scotscharacter checks him, which is just as well, for what she should havesaid was that there had been winkles. 'Not me. You're just a commonrogue.' He seats himself far from the table. 'Now, then, out with it.Sit down!' She sits meekly; there is nothing she would not do for him.'As you char, I suppose you are on your feet all day.''I'm more on my knees.''That's where you should be to me.''Oh, mister, I'm willing.''Stop it. Go on, you accomplished liar.''It's true that my name is Dowey.''It's enough to make me change mine.''I've been charring and charring and charring as far back as I mind.I've been in London this twenty years.''We'll skip your early days. I have an appointment.''And then when I was old the war broke out.''How could it affect you?''Oh, mister, that's the thing. It didn't affect me. It affectedeverybody but me. The neighbours looked down on me. Even the posters, onthe walls, of the woman saying, "Go, my boy," leered at me. I sometimescried by myself in the dark. You won't have a cup of tea?''No.''Sudden like the idea came to me to pretend I had a son.''You depraved old limmer! But what in the name of Old Nick made youchoose me out of the whole British Army?'Mrs. Dowey giggles. There is little doubt that in her youth she was anaccomplished flirt. 'Maybe, mister, it was because I liked you best.''Now, now, woman.''I read one day in the papers, "In which, he was assisted by Private K.Dowey, 5th Battalion, Black Watch."'Private K. Dowey is flattered, 'Did you, now! Well, I expect that's theonly time I was ever in the papers.'Mrs. Dowey tries it on again, 'I didn't choose you for that alone. Iread a history of the Black Watch first, to make sure it was the bestregiment in the world.''Anybody could have told you that.' He is moving about now in betterhumour, and, meeting the loaf in his stride, he cuts a slice from it. Heis hardly aware of this, but Mrs. Dowey knows. 'I like the Scotch voiceof you, woman. It drummles on like a hill burn.''Prosen Water runs by where I was born.' Flirting again, 'May be itteached me to speak, mister.''Canny, woman, canny.''I read about the Black Watch's ghostly piper that plays proudly whenthe men of the Black Watch do well, and prouder when they fall.''There's some foolish story of that kind.' He has another careless sliceoff the loaf. 'But you couldn't have been living here at that time orthey would have guessed. I suppose you flitted?''Yes, it cost me eleven and sixpence.''How did you guess the _K_ in my name stood for Kenneth?''Does it?''Umpha.''An angel whispered it to me in my sleep.''Well, that's the only angel in the whole black business.' He chuckles.'You little thought I would turn up!' Wheeling suddenly on her. 'Or didyou?''I was beginning to weary for a sight of you, Kenneth.''What word was that?''Mister.'He helps himself to butter, and she holds out the jam pot to him, but hehaughtily rejects it. Do you think she gives in now? Not a bit of it.He returns to sarcasm, 'I hope you're pleased with me now you see me.''I'm very pleased. Does your folk live in Scotland?''Glasgow.''Both living?''Ay.''Is your mother terrible proud of you?''Naturally.''You'll be going to them?''After I've had a skite in London first.'The old lady sniffs, 'So she is in London!''Who?''Your young lady.''Are you jealyous?''Not me.''You needna be. She's a young thing.''You surprises me. A beauty, no doubt?''You may be sure.' He tries the jam. 'She's a titled person. She isequally popular as maid, wife and munition-worker.'Mrs. Dowey remembers Lady Dolly Kanister, so familiar to readers offashionable gossip, and a very leery expression indeed comes into herface.'Tell me more about her, man.''She has sent me a lot of things, especially cakes, and a worstedwaistcoat, with a loving message on the enclosed card.'The old lady is now in a quiver of excitement. She loses control ofher arms, which jump excitedly this way and that.'You'll try one of my cakes, mister?''Not me.''They're of my own making.''No, I thank you.'But with a funny little run she is in the pantry and back again. Sheplanks down a cake before him, at sight of which he gapes.'What's the matter? Tell me, oh, tell me, mister.''That's exactly the kind of cake that her ladyship sends me.'Mrs. Dowey is now a very glorious old character indeed.'Is the waistcoat right, mister? I hope the Black Watch colours pleasedyou.''Wha----t! Was it you?''I daredna give my own name, you see, and I was always reading hers inthe papers.'The badgered man looms over her, terrible for the last time.'Woman, is there no getting rid of you!''Are you angry?'He sits down with a groan.'Oh, hell! Give me some tea.'She rushes about preparing a meal for him, every bit of her wantingto cry out to every other bit, 'Oh, glory, glory, glory!' For a momentshe hovers behind his chair. 'Kenneth'! she murmurs. 'What?' he asks,no longer aware that she is taking a liberty. 'Nothing,' she says,'just Kenneth,' and is off gleefully for the tea-caddy. But when histea is poured out, and he has drunk a saucerful, the instinct ofself-preservation returns to him between two bites.'Don't you be thinking, missis, for one minute that you have got me.''No, no.'On that understanding he unbends.'I have a theatre to-night, followed by a randy-dandy.''Oho! Kenneth, this is a queer first meeting!''It is, woman, oh, it is,' guardedly, 'and it's also a last meeting.''Yes, yes.''So here's to you--you old mop and pail. _Ave atque vale_.''What's that?''That means Hail and Farewell.''Are you a scholar?''Being Scotch, there's almost nothing I don't know.''What was you to trade?''Carter, glazier, orraman, any rough jobs.''You're a proper man to look at.''I'm generally admired.''She's an enviable woman.''Who?''Your mother.''Eh? Oh, that was just protecting myself from you. I have neither fathernor mother nor wife nor grandmama.' Bitterly, 'This party never evenknew who his proud parents were.''Is that'--gleaming--'is that true?''It's gospel.''Heaven be praised!''Eh? None of that! I was a fool to tell you. But don't think you cantake advantage of it. Pass the cake.''I daresay it's true we'll never meet again, Kenneth, but--but if we do,I wonder where it will be?''Not in this world.''There's no telling'--leering ingratiatingly--'It might be at Berlin.''Tod, if I ever get to Berlin, I believe I'll find you there waitingfor me!''With a cup of tea for you in my hand.''Yes, and'--heartily--'very good tea too.'He has partaken heavily, he is now in high good humour.'Kenneth, we could come back by Paris!''All the ladies,' slapping his knees, 'likes to go to Paris.''Oh, Kenneth, Kenneth, if just once before I die I could be fitted fora Paris gown with dreamy corsage!''You're all alike, old covey. We have a song about it.' He sings:  'Mrs. Gill is very ill,     Nothing can improve her   But to see the Tuileries     And waddle through the Louvre.'No song ever had a greater success. Mrs. Dowey is doubled up with mirth.When she comes to, when they both come to, for there are a pair of them,she cries:'You must learn me that,' and off she goes in song also:  'Mrs. Dowey's very ill,     Nothing can improve her.''Stop!' cries clever Kenneth, and finishes the verse:  'But dressed up in a Paris gown    To waddle through the Louvre.'They fling back their heads, she points at him, he points at her. Shesays ecstatically:'Hairy legs!'A mad remark, which brings him to his senses; he remembers who and whatshe is.'Mind your manners!' Rising, 'Well, thank you for my tea. I must bestepping.'Poor Mrs. Dowey, he is putting on his kit.'Where are you living?'He sighs.'That's the question. But there's a place called The Hut, where some ofthe 2nd Battalion are. They'll take me in. Beggars,' bitterly, 'can't bechoosers.''Beggars?''I've never been here before. If you knew'--a shadow coming overhim--'what it is to be in such a place without a friend. I was crazywith glee, when I got my leave, at the thought of seeing London at last,but after wandering its streets for four hours, I would almost have beenglad to be back in the trenches.''If you knew,' he has said, but indeed the old lady knows.'That's my quandorum too, Kenneth.'He nods sympathetically.'I'm sorry for you, you poor old body,' shouldering his kit. 'But I seeno way out for either of us.'A cooing voice says, 'Do you not?''Are you at it again!'She knows that it must be now or never. She has left her biggest gunsfor the end. In her excitement she is rising up and down on her toes.'Kenneth, I've heard that the thing a man on leave longs for more thananything else is a bed with sheets, and a bath.''You never heard anything truer.''Go into that pantry, Kenneth Dowey, and lift the dresser-top, and tellme what you see.'He goes. There is an awful stillness. He returns, impressed.'It's a kind of a bath!''You could do yourself there pretty, half at a time.''Me?''There's a woman through the wall that would be very willing to give mea shakedown till your leave is up.'He snorts.'Oh, is there!'She has not got him yet, but there is still one more gun.'Kenneth, look!'With these simple words she lets down the bed. She says no more; aneffect like this would be spoilt by language. Fortunately he is notmade of stone. He thrills.'My word! That's the dodge we need in the trenches.''That's your bed, Kenneth.''Mine?' He grins at her. 'You queer old divert. What can make you sokeen to be burdened by a lump like me?''He! he! he! he!''I tell you, I'm the commonest kind of man.''I'm just the commonest kind of old wifie myself.''I've been a kick-about all my life, and I'm no great shakes at thewar.''Yes, you are. How many Germans have you killed?''Just two for certain, and there was no glory in it. It was just becausethey wanted my shirt.''Your shirt?''Well, they said it was their shirt.''Have you took prisoners?''I once took half a dozen, but that was a poor affair too.''How could one man take half a dozen?''Just in the usual way. I surrounded them.''Kenneth, you're just my ideal.''You're easily pleased.'He turns again to the bed, 'Let's see how the thing works.' He kneadsthe mattress with his fist, and the result is so satisfactory that heputs down his kit.'Old lady, if you really want me, I'll bide.''Oh! oh! oh! oh!'Her joy is so demonstrative that he has to drop a word of warning.'But, mind you, I don't accept you as a relation. For your personalglory, you can go on pretending to the neighbours; but the best I cansay for you is that you're on your probation. I'm a cautious character,and we must see how you'll turn out.''Yes, Kenneth.''And now, I think, for that bath. My theatre begins at six-thirty. Acove I met on a 'bus is going with me.'She is a little alarmed.'You're sure you'll come back?''Yes, yes,' handsomely, 'I leave my kit in pledge.''You won't liquor up too freely, Kenneth?''You're the first,' chuckling, 'to care whether I do or not.' Nothingshe has said has pleased the lonely man so much as this. 'I promise.Tod, I'm beginning to look forward to being wakened in the morning byhearing you cry, "Get up, you lazy swine." I've kind of envied men thathad womenfolk with the right to say that.'He is passing to the bathroom when a diverting notion strikes him.'What is it, Kenneth?''The theatre. It would be showier if I took a lady.'Mrs. Dowey feels a thumping at her breast.'Kenneth, tell me this instant what you mean. Don't keep me on thejumps.'He turns her round.'No, It couldn't be done.''Was it me you were thinking of?''Just for the moment,' regretfully, 'but you have no style.'She catches hold of him by the sleeve.'Not in this, of course. But, oh, Kenneth, if you saw me in my merino!It's laced up the back in the very latest.''Hum,' doubtfully; 'but let's see it.'It is produced from a drawer, to which the old lady runs with almostindecent haste. The connoisseur examines it critically.'Looks none so bad. Have you a bit of chiffon for the neck? It's notbombs nor Kaisers nor Tipperary that men in the trenches think of, it'schiffon.''I swear I have, Kenneth, And I have a bangle, and a muff, and gloves.''Ay, ay.' He considers. 'Do you think you could give your face less ofa homely look?''I'm sure I could.''Then you can have a try. But, mind you, I promise nothing. All willdepend on the effect.'He goes into the pantry, and the old lady is left alone. Not alone, forshe is ringed round by entrancing hopes and dreadful fears. They beam onher and jeer at her, they pull her this way and that; with difficultyshe breaks through them and rushes to her pail, hot water, soap, anda looking-glass. Our last glimpse of her for this evening shows herstaring (not discontentedly) at her soft old face, licking her palm,and pressing it to her hair. Her eyes are sparkling.       *       *       *       *       *One evening a few days later Mrs. Twymley and Mrs. Mickleham are in Mrs.Dowey's house, awaiting that lady's return from some fashionabledissipation. They have undoubtedly been discussing the war, for thefirst words we catch are:MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I tell you flat, Amelia, I bows no knee to junkerdom.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Sitting here by the fire, you and me, as one to another,what do you think will happen after the war? Are we to go back to beingas we were?'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Speaking for myself, Amelia, not me. The war haswakened me up to a understanding of my own importance that is reallyastonishing.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Same here. Instead of being the poor worms the like ofyou and me thought we was, we turns out to be visible departments ofa great and haughty empire.'They are well under weigh, and with a little luck we might now heartheir views on various passing problems of the day, such as the neglectof science in our public schools. But in comes the Haggerty Woman, andspoils everything. She is attired, like them, in her best, but theeffect of her is that her clothes have gone out for a walk, leaving herat home.MRS. MICKLEHAM, with deep distaste, 'Here's that submarine again.'The Haggerty Woman cringes to them, but gets no encouragement.THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'It's a terrible war.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Is that so?'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'I wonder what will happen when it ends?'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I have no idea.'The intruder produces her handkerchief, but does not use it. After all,she is in her best.THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Are they not back yet?'Perfect ladies must reply to a direct question.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'No,' icily. 'We have been waiting this half hour. Theyare at the theatre again.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'You tell me! I just popped in with an insignificantpresent for him, as his leave is up.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'The same errand brought us.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'My present is cigarettes.'They have no intention of telling her what their presents are, but thesecret leaps from them.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'So is mine.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Mine too.'Triumph of the Haggerty Woman. But it is short-lived.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Mine has gold tips.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'So has mine.'The Haggerty Woman need not say a word. You have only to look at her toknow that her cigarettes are not gold-tipped. She tries to brazen itout, which is so often a mistake.THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'What care I? Mine is Exquisytos.'No wonder they titter.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Excuse us, Mrs. Haggerty (if that's your name), but theword is Exquiseetos.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Much obliged' (weeps).MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I think I heard a taxi.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'It will be her third this week.'They peer through the blind. They are so excited that rank is forgotten.THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'What is she in?'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'A new astrakhan jacket he gave her, with Venussleeves.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'Has she sold her gabardine coat?'MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Not her! She has them both at the theatre, warm nightthough it is. She's wearing the astrakhan, and carrying the gabardine,flung careless-like over her arm.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'I saw her strutting about with him yesterday,looking as if she thought the two of them made a procession.'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Hsh!' peeping, 'Strike me dead, if she's not comingmincing down the stair, hooked on his arm!'Indeed it is thus that Mrs. Dowey enters. Perhaps she had seen shadowslurking on the blind, and at once hooked on to Kenneth to impress thevisitors. She is quite capable of it.Now we see what Kenneth saw that afternoon five days ago when he emergedfrom the bathroom and found the old trembler awaiting his inspection.Here are the muff and the gloves and the chiffon, and such a kind oldbonnet that it makes you laugh at once; I don't know how to describe it,but it is trimmed with a kiss, as bonnets should be when the wearer isold and frail. We must take the merino for granted until she steps outof the astrakhan. She is dressed up to the nines, there is no doubtabout it. Yes, but is her face less homely? Above all, has she style?The answer is in a stout affirmative. Ask Kenneth. He knows. Many a timehe has had to go behind a door to roar hilariously at the old lady. Hehas thought of her as a lark to tell his mates about by and by; but forsome reason that he cannot fathom, he knows now that he will never dothat.MRS. DOWEY. 'Kenneth,' affecting surprise, 'we have visitors!'DOWEY. 'Your servant, ladies.'He is no longer mud-caked and dour. A very smart figure is this PrivateDowey, and he winks engagingly at the visitors, like one who knows thatfor jolly company you cannot easily beat charwomen. The pleasantriesthat he and they have exchanged this week! The sauce he has given them.The wit of Mrs. Mickleham's retorts. The badinage of Mrs. Twymley. Theneat giggles of the Haggerty Woman. There has been nothing like it sinceyou took the countess in to dinner.MRS. TWYMLEY. 'We should apologise. We're not meaning to stay.'MRS. DOWEY. 'You are very welcome. Just wait'--the ostentation ofthis!--'till I get out of my astrakhan--and my muff--and my gloves--and'(it is the bonnet's turn now) 'my Excelsior.'At last we see her in the merino (a triumph).MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'You've given her a glory time, Mr. Dowey.'DOWEY. 'It's her that has given it to me, missis.'MRS. DOWEY. 'Hey! hey! hey! hey! He just pampers me,' waggling herfists. 'The Lord forgive us, but this being the last night, we had asit-down supper at a restaurant!' Vehemently: 'I swear by God that wehad champagny wine.' There is a dead stillness, and she knows very wellwhat it means, she has even prepared for it: 'And to them as doubts myword--here's the cork.'She places the cork, in its lovely gold drapery, upon the table.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'I'm sure!'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'I would thank you, Mrs. Dowey, not to say a word againstmy Alfred.'MRS. DOWEY. 'Me!'DOWEY. 'Come, come, ladies,' in the masterful way that is so hard forwomen to resist; 'if you say another word, I'll kiss the lot of you.'There is a moment of pleased confusion.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Really, them sodgers!'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'The kilties is the worst!'MRS. TWYMLEY. 'I'm sure,' heartily, 'we don't grudge you your treats,Mrs. Dowey; and sorry we are that this is the end.'DOWEY. 'Yes, it's the end,' with a troubled look at his old lady; 'Imust be off in ten minutes.'The little soul is too gallant to break down in company. She hurriesinto the pantry and shuts the door.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'Poor thing! But we must run, for you'll be having somelast words to say to her.'DOWEY. 'I kept her out long on purpose so as to have less time to saythem in.'He more than half wishes that he could make a bolt to a public-house.MRS. TWYMLEY. 'It's the best way.' In the important affairs of lifethere is not much that any one can teach a charwoman. 'Just a merenothing, to wish you well, Mr. Dowey.'All three present him with the cigarettes.MRS. MICKLEHAM. 'A scraping, as one might say.'THE HAGGERTY WOMAN. 'The heart,' enigmatically, 'is warm though it maynot be gold-tipped.'DOWEY. 'You bricks!'THE LADIES. 'Good luck, cocky.'DOWEY. 'The same to you. And if you see a sodger man up there in a kilt,he is one that is going back with me. Tell him not to come down,but--but to give me till the last minute, and then to whistle.'It is quite a grave man who is left alone, thinking what to do next. Hetries a horse laugh, but that proves of no help. He says 'Hell!' tohimself, but it is equally ineffective. Then he opens the pantry doorand calls.'Old lady.'She comes timidly to the door, her hand up as if to ward off a blow.'Is it time?'An encouraging voice answers her.'No, no, not yet. I've left word for Dixon to whistle when go I must.''All is ended.''Now, then, you promised to be gay. We were to help one another.''Yes, Kenneth.''It's bad for me, but it's worse for you.''The men have medals to win, you see.''The women have their medals, too.' He knows she likes him to order herabout, so he tries it again.'Come here. No, I'll come to you.' He stands gaping at her wonderingly.He has no power of words, nor does he quite know what he would like tosay. 'God!''What is it, Kenneth?''You're a woman.''I had near forgot it.'He wishes he was at the station with Dixon. Dixon is sure to have abottle in his pocket. They will be roaring a song presently. But inthe meantime--there is that son business. Blethers, the whole thing,of course--or mostly blethers. But it's the way to please her.'Have you noticed you have never called me son?''Have I noticed it! I was feared, Kenneth. You said I was on probation.''And so you were. Well, the probation's ended.' He laughs uncomfortably.'The like of me! But if you want me you can have me.''Kenneth, will I do?''Woman,' artfully gay, 'don't be so forward. Wait till I have proposed.''Propose for a mother?''What for no?' In the grand style, 'Mrs. Dowey, you queer carl, youspunky tiddy, have I your permission to ask you the most importantquestion a neglected orphan can ask of an old lady?'She bubbles with mirth. Who could help it, the man has such a way withhim.'None of your sauce, Kenneth.''For a long time, Mrs. Dowey, you cannot have been unaware of my sonnishfeelings for you.''Wait till I get my mop to you!''And if you're not willing to be my mother, I swear I'll never askanother.'The old divert pulls him down to her and strokes his hair.'Was I a well-behaved infant, mother?''Not you, sonny, you were a rampaging rogue.''Was I slow in learning to walk?''The quickest in our street. He! he! he!' She starts up. 'Was that thewhistle?''No, no. See here. In taking me over you have, in a manner of speaking,joined the Black Watch.''I like to think that, Kenneth.''Then you must behave so that the ghost piper can be proud of you.'Tion!' She stands bravely at attention. 'That's the style. Now listen,I've sent in your name as being my nearest of kin, and your allowancewill be coming to you weekly in the usual way.''Hey! hey! hey! Is it wicked, Kenneth?''I'll take the responsibility for it in both worlds. You see, I want youto be safeguarded in case anything hap--''Kenneth!'''Tion! Have no fear. I'll come back, covered with mud and medals. Mindyou have that cup of tea waiting for me.' He is listening for thewhistle. He pulls her on to his knee.'Hey! hey! hey! hey!''What fun we'll have writing to one another! Real letters this time!''Yes.''It would be a good plan if you began the first letter as soon as I'vegone.''I will.''I hope Lady Dolly will go on sending me cakes.''You may be sure.'He ties his scarf round her neck.'You must have been a bonny thing when you were young.''Away with you!''That scarf sets you fine.''Blue was always my colour.'The whistle sounds.'Old lady, you are what Blighty means to me now.'She hides in the pantry again. She is out of sight to us, but shedoes something that makes Private Dowey take off his bonnet. Thenhe shoulders his equipment and departs. That is he laughing coarselywith Dixon.We have one last glimpse of the old lady--a month or two after Kenneth'sdeath in action. It would be rosemary to us to see her in her blackdress, of which she is very proud; but let us rather peep at her in thefamiliar garments that make a third to her mop and pail. It is earlymorning, and she is having a look at her medals before setting off onthe daily round. They are in a drawer, with the scarf covering them, andon the scarf a piece of lavender. First, the black frock, which shecarries in her arms like a baby. Then her War Savings Certificates,Kenneth's bonnet, a thin packet of real letters, and the famouschampagne cork. She kisses the letters, but she does not blub over them.She strokes the dress, and waggles her head over the certificates andpresses the bonnet to her cheeks, and rubs the tinsel of the corkcarefully with her apron. She is a tremulous old 'un; yet she exults,for she owns all these things, and also the penny flag on her breast.She puts them away in the drawer, the scarf over them, the lavender onthe scarf. Her air of triumph well becomes her. She lifts the pail andthe mop, and slouches off gamely to the day's toil.THE NEW WORDAny room nowadays must be the scene, for any father and any son are the_dramatis personae_. We could pick them up in Mayfair, in Tooting,on the Veldt, in rectories or in grocers' back parlours, dump them downon our toy stage and tell them to begin. It is a great gathering tochoose from, but our needs are small. Let the company shake hands, andall go away but two.The two who have remained (it is discovered on inquiry) are Mr. Torranceand his boy; so let us make use of them. Torrance did not linger inorder to be chosen, he was anxious, like all of them, to be off; but werecognised him, and sternly signed to him to stay. Not that we knew himpersonally, but the fact is, we remembered him (we never forget a face)as the legal person who reads out the names of the jury before the courtopens, and who brushes aside your reasons for wanting to be let off. Itpleases our humour to tell Mr. Torrance that we cannot let him off.He does not look so formidable as when last we saw him, and this isperhaps owing to our no longer being hunched with others on thoseunfeeling benches. It is not because he is without a wig, for we sawhim, on the occasion to which we are so guardedly referring, both in awig and out of it; he passed behind a screen without it, and immediately(as quickly as we write) popped out in it, giving it a finishing touchrather like the butler's wriggle to his coat as he goes to the door.There are the two kinds of learned brothers, those who use the screen,and those who (so far as the jury knows) sleep in their wigs. The latterare the swells, and include the judges; whom, however, we have seen inthe public thoroughfares without their wigs, a horrible sight that hasdoubtless led many an onlooker to crime.Mr. Torrance, then, is no great luminary; indeed, when we accompany himto his house, as we must, in order to set our scene properly, we findthat it is quite a suburban affair, only one servant kept, and her nieceengaged twice a week to crawl about the floors. There is no fire in thedrawing-room, so the family remain on after dinner in the dining-room,which rather gives them away. There is really no one in the room butRoger. That is the truth of it, though to the unseeing eye all thefamily are there except Roger. They consist of Mr., Mrs., and MissTorrance. Mr. Torrance is enjoying his evening paper and a cigar, andevery line of him is insisting stubbornly that nothing unusual ishappening in the house. In the home circle (and now that we think of it,even in court) he has the reputation of being a somewhat sarcasticgentleman; he must be dogged, too, otherwise he would have ceased longago to be sarcastic to his wife, on whom wit falls like pellets onsandbags; all the dents they make are dimples.Mrs. Torrance is at present exquisitely employed; she is listening toRoger's step overhead. You, know what a delightful step the boy has. Andwhat is more remarkable is that Emma is listening to it too, Emma who isseventeen, and who has been trying to keep Roger in his place ever sincehe first compelled her to bowl to him. Things have come to a pass whena sister so openly admits that she is only number two in the house.Remarks well worthy of being recorded fall from these two ladies as theygaze upward. 'I think--didn't I, Emma?' is the mother's contribution,while it is Emma who replies in a whisper, 'No, not yet!'Mr. Torrance calmly reads, or seems to read, for it is not possible thatthere can be anything in the paper as good as this. Indeed, heoccasionally casts a humorous glance at his women-folk. Perhaps he istrying to steady them. Let us hope he has some such good reason forbreaking in from time to time on their entrancing occupation.'Listen to this, dear. It is very important. The paper says, uponapparently good authority, that love laughs at locksmiths.'His wife answers without lowering her eyes. 'Did you speak, John? I amlistening.''Yes, I was telling you that the Hidden Hand has at last been discoveredin a tub in Russell Square.''I hear, John. How thoughtful.''And so they must have been made of margarine, my love.''I shouldn't wonder, John.''Hence the name Petrograd.''Oh, was that the reason?''You will be pleased to hear, Ellen, that the honourable gentleman thenresumed his seat.''That was nice of him.''As I,' good-naturedly, 'now resume mine, having made my usualimpression.''Yes, John.'Emma slips upstairs to peep through a keyhole, and it strikes her motherthat John has been saying something. They are on too good terms to makean apology necessary. She observes blandly, 'John, I haven't heard aword you said.''I'm sure you haven't, woman.''I can't help
